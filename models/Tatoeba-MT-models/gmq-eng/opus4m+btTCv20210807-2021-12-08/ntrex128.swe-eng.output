AM in Wales is concerned that "promoting like puckon"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused with a proposal to change their title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of Wales Parliament).
The proposal will change the name of the National Assembly to Wales Parliament.
AM across the political spectrum is concerned about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who can't Welsh: Twp means stupid on Welsh and pwp means bajs.
An AM for Plaid said that the group was generally "missible" and has proposed other options.
A conservative wa readers said his group is "open" for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context W is spoken in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which currently compiles legislation for the name change, said: "The final decision for what members of the congregation should be called is so clear up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, which found a strong support for calling the Assembly for Wales Parliament.
The original title for AM proposed the Commission Welsh Parliament Members (members of Wales Parliament) or WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM clearly suggests other options, but problems with reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The amendment legislation also includes other changes to how the congregation works, including the rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the Committee system.
AM may vote on what they should be called when they debate legislation.
Macedonia implements a referendum on the change of the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote if they are to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been ongoing for several decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said he will ignore the result.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The locks in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem encounter problems
“Elder people I’m talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner of the corner,” Mr Adams said.
"Now there is neither."
He said it is understandable that the bars disappear.
"People are going on in other ways now," he said.
"Barer is not like the area's living room anymore, your people go on a regular basis."
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as far as the leaders wait and that "before or later they end up on the route again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with ownership apartments filled by people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, as those who move into the apartments will probably not be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black assembly led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of stores on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or prosecute black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson's Assembly planned the renovation, they also built the clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor of St. Martin's, called proud music game for "the watches of the poor."
The expert who played the clock game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "a irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first watch game played by a black musician — Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not retire.
In recent months, St. Martin’s events are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs — some hired by the church’s playwrights, others of the Episcopal Founded.
The Church Meeting — the governing body of the congregation, which consists of laymen, wrote to the founder in July and expressed a concern that the founder would "try to transfer the cost" to the church meeting, despite the fact that the church meeting had not been involved when the founder hired architects and contractors.
Some assembly members complained of a lack of transparency from the founding.
Haj damages 13-year-old who dies after lobster in California
On Saturday, a 13-year-old boy who died after lobster in California on the first day of the summer season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just glad to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
“I’ve been bitten!”
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that the whole key leg had been worn up.
"I cried to everyone to get out of the water, 'It's a shark in the water!'" said Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is said to be critical.
It is not clear what hate it was.
The security team Larry Giles told mass media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been established that it was not a dangerous hat.
Giles also said the victim suffered trauma damage to his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's gets into Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with varushus-like beauty scenes with beauty specialists.
As part of a substantial push into the UK’s beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the falling fashion and household market, the larger beauty times will be tested in 11 stores across and implemented in more stores next year if successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the fast-paced attempts to fill the shelves that are brought up by TV appliances, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they intend to double their beauty offerings up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have greater space with selected areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The store chain also launches its boutique brand again so that most of the products are vegan - which increasingly young customers demand.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume salesman will test in two Sainsbury's stores - the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy less quantities of food every day in local stores means that fast buying has to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look increasingly like warehouses in an attempt to fight against cheap stores such as Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stocks in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitats stocks since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased the sales of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boots sales in the supermarket would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxury skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial boss, said: "We have given our beauty benefits a new look and a new feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can provide customers with advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all the needs, and with an appealing environment in agile places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to shop.”
Peter Jones "surprisingly" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of £111 million
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones is "surprising" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not wear their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
This Morning representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out their lucrative lifestyle brand in the last minute - to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "surprising" at a busy meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV apparition concluded that her new contract — worth up to £1.5 million — meant she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The company has compared Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of £111 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced she leaves Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's main priority.
It would be her long-term future for the next decade.
Her decision to get rid of shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the Marlow headquarters.”
Experts believe that this Morning representative’s decision to withdraw may cost the company several million due to significant investments in everything from pillows and light to clothing, as well as the risk of further delays of the launch.
This may mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child momman Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of president in March.
The couple semi-finals together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production companies.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business business."
The snack "and then we'll be dear."
He joked that mass media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be “a worthy president” and because he was so positive about North Korea’s leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newness vote":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been fixed.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "motional response" from the United States after North Korea's first disarmament step.
He noted that the United States will continue sanctions intended to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the way to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship.”
He said his attempt to improve Kim's relationship with Kim has had positive results - an end to rocket tests, freed the hostages and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena we'd have around 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy islands in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake on Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that over 10% of the Lombox population had lost their homes, there was no state of emergency, which is required for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which complicates it all,” Ms Sumbung said.
Save the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesperson of the natural disaster agency, said Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Given the constant earthquakes of Indonesia, the country remains inconveniently unprepared for the wrath of nature.
It has been built tsunami protection in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The cause of a tsunami alert in Palu, despite the fact that a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even in perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the promise of improving Indonesia’s worn infrastructure in its election campaign and has spent huge sums of time on roads and train trails.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's elections.
Mr Joko is also being pushed by every sectarian tension in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, pilgrims and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge received in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturdridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team was looking for 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the away chair.
The attempt flew high above the target area against the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's hope and entered the net.
"I just tried to hammer in a position to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kate approach and didn’t think so much about it but kicked just.”
Chelsea led a 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striper handed a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spind off near the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the middle of the field.
Then he got a great kick that brought in Hazard in the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the away chair with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool struggles against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is against VIdeoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Death rate for tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death penalty for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency in early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the games of buildings that raced in the earthquake of 7.5 which struck Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The town of Palu, with over 3800,000 inhabitants, was full of waves from buildings that razed.
Police arrested, 32, suspected of murder after the woman is killed.
A murder investigation has been started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with a knife wound at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
Police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to emerge.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone close to John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman found living in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who believe that they feel the woman was sent to the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment, but the police said that no one gets to enter or go out of the building.
He was goalless when he found out what had happened.
The accommodations in the building have been informed that it takes several hours before they get back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is treated as a crime site.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
She says, "It's so terrible" over and over again.
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the fort and another just outside.
A number of police assistants were within the suspension with an overview of the apartment building.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell Latest Victims for the Rewriting of History
A ban announcement would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal for "darkness" and "try to write about history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be pulled into the ongoing debate about removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Fel Cromwell might have been sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 19th century's opinion of and is part of the historiography of a man who many consider still to be hailed.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, believe that Cromwell defended parliament against pressure from the outside, in his fall from the monarchy.
If this is a correct representation, the subject of an ongoing historical debate is subject to an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has undoubtedly affected our nation’s development, and Cromwell is a well-known person representing one side of the case.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Darker Pigs Kill pawns
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject the vaccine in pigs in a pig paste on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have travelled with his cousin from Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a pig's bed nearby was open.
He said there was a large pig shark in the pork with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilo heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The hostage that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while police collected evidence on the site.
Yuan's family and the responsible for the market are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It is rare for pigs to attack people, but it has happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and gave the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig pressured 300 kilos of solid a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared him away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can serve as a "catalyst."
"They're just playful.
They noses and are very curious. They don't want to hurt anyone.
"You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa for widespread heavy rains to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weaker as it travels across cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring overcast rain to northern Mexico and southwest the United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at 5 p.m. on Sunday, and found 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
During the time, a tributary is formed over the Pacific Ocean and travels east to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching straw will create vastly heavy rain in the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Locally, 2.5-10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, mud flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5 to7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Suddenly floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that someone get out in the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rains can make canyons for flooded rivers and ash storms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching straw for some local heavy rains to parts of southern California's coastline.
It is possible with a total of over a cm of rain, which can lead to mudflows and tail roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some skin-grade tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will be spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may involve intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in central United States on Sunday.
It is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start to October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the Northeast United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be around five degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high chance of warmer temperatures than average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
More than 20 million watched Thursday's arrest testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, on six TV networks.
In the meantime, political death and normal broadcast were interrupted for Friday's last minute-twist, Arizona's Senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI, where they received a week to investigate the accusation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she is absolutely sure Kavanaugh was caught on her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
The estimated average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks showing the interrogation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking from office.
In comparison, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the playoffs or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown a strong support for Kavanaugh’s nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the daytime interrogation, according to Nielsen.
The ABC had the second largest of 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was focused on Friday’s drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement saying that he would vote for Kavanaugh filmed CNN and CBS protesters screaming at him when he tried to take an elevator to a hearing with the Judicial Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the protesters screamed at him, which was shown in the direct broadcast of CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he tells the truth of the country?”
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV network sent live several hours later when the Judicial Committee voted on if they were to bring further Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he was only going to do that if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee in the coming week, which the minority Democrats have committed.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flakes' decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political toys" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political play" on Britain's future and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued her attack against her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said the proposal for the UK and the EU to collect each other's customs duties was "completely unreasonable."
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the death penalty of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in custody for murder, said the police at Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
Police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After hearing with Simpson, the police said he acknowledged that he shot Mr. Wayde.
His castle was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The court doctor of East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Staff, the police's state law lab, Southern University's police and residents in the area for assistance with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "fifty and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 metre long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday's mother, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crossed" and "chocked" by Waydes' death.
"You're worried about this all the time," Wade said.
Vulkan Asks Ask about Mexico City
Aska from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned on Saturday's Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been discovered in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The Centre discovered several mules and shells.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on wind turbines in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted increased activity in the volcano that stands 72 km south-east of the capital since a 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Polis joins Catalan separatists for the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters met with demandsallpolis while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by demandsallpolis threw eggs and color powder on them, leading to dark ponds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battle targets also broke out later in the day and policemen used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the unionists shouted "long live Spain."
14 people were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The vote is still held in the region longing for independence one year after the referendum on the first October which was considered illegal by Madrid but hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but participation was low when most opposed to the secession boycott voting.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
Electrician Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatists protest with his wife and said he no longer believes that Catalonia will be independent.
Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry with joy to vote, but now we’ve run fast,” he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties that are too independent have had difficulty keeping the driving force up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or sit in waiting for trial on their role in the organization of referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his mobile, said that the conflict had been four-quarters of politicians on both sides.
"It's getting increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been suing since the end of last year, announced that he is thinking of Canadians in the election to the European Parliament next year.
"The best way to condemn the European Parliament is to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into house
Three men - 33, 34 and 39 - have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An arm drill can also be fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Mengas's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split two with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not won a win in the Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, the next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning streak to six matches - head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses chances against cross visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead far before they made goals; their right-wingness gave the Rangers all the possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but slid his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot boards after sliding in to measure Craig Halkett's nipple across the goal.
The team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, when they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that was the decisive goal.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, making goals from the middle of the target area.
In that situation, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was uneven and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was left largely in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot boards from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings came constantly into Livingston's goal area and were handled without any problems. Two penalty requirements - after Halkett's challenge of replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand - were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Every one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the road up.
Their game style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honour of having galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skilled organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worall on the heel straight through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments at Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn’t have to have to - they just opened the home page once - and it’s one of the alarm clocks for the Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan gets a mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, the leiden and blue sky offered (29 September) when Turkey and Germany's leaders at breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become osams over human rights, freedom of expression and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters were gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duel protests show the split views of a visitor who is considered a hero of some German Turks and condemned as a sovereign of others.
Deptford: Cyclist Dies in Cock With Car
A cyclist has died in a crash with a car in London.
The cross took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-trained road in Deptford in southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the healthcare provider was called there, but the man died on the spot.
Krocken takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infectious accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the cockpit on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they are trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked by and buses have been diverted and car drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Sex guards damaged in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in unrest on a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The phenomena broke out on HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado guards" have been called there to deal with the concerns, involving eight prisoners on a flight.
The guards were treated in place for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Several trained prison staff have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be attributed to the police and may have extended prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in hospitals after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, the demandsallpolis was called to the prison to deal with serious concerns where staff were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood (areas with drought can take advantage)
It’s rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy pulls across the desert in the southwestern United States, with a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, bringing rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "thio tropical cyclones have maintained status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the border of Arizona.
National Hurricane Center’s latest models predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including central rocky mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 2.5-5.5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be used because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme droughts, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the Peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday mornings with max wind force of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm bumps into cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which calms down it.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s landmass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can have heavy rains, which pose a significant risk of flooding.
"Samed 7.5-15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to north-west Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora and desert in the south-west United States," said National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for murder attempt
Three boys in the teen and a 20-year-old have been arrested for murder attempts after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police said in Avon and Somerset.
The police ask anyone who can have filed what happened with the mobile phone to come out.
Trump says Kavanaugh "led, elektiness, anger" from the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said to his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "lid of the elektiness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nominee process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly denied and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he was sexually assaulting her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress on his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw it brilliant and quality and fashion" at Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of our most skilled legal minds, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public,” he told his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming mid-term elections.
“We are five weeks from one of our most important choices.
I don't know, but I candider," he said.
“That’s why I’m going around and fighting for sovereign candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are trying to "understand and prevent."
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of dead in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number rising
At least 384 people died, many swathed away when giant waves crashed on the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters of high waves crashed to the beach in the sky and swung out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in its way.
Tsunamine came after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of immediately running from there, and they fell victim to tsunamine," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamine was not alone but slid with cars, stocks and houses. The affected everything in its way," said Nugroho. He also said that tsunamine had been traveling on open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up into trees to escape tsunamine and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
The air photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks, the coastal town continued to hit on Saturday.
The radius of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesia Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times the size of the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located in the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made tsunamine larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "wide" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the sudden collapse of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the victims and injuries may be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication from Donggala "was totally paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people there," said Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can be much worse,” they said.
The Agency was criticised on Saturday for not informing that tsunamine had hit Palu, but the authorities said the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man is heard on the upper floor of a building screaming frenetic warnings about tsunamine to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes towards the beach and hovers away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunamine led to a widespread stream of power that interrupted all communications around Palu, which hampered the rescue work for the authorities.
The military has started sending your cargo flight with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city’s airport has been opened for relief work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widododo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of dead in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from the World Vision in Donggala have taken refuge in Palu where they seek protection under pressure on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many ruined houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance groups have started the bipartisan aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may only be used if the exemption permits are issued after a disaster.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Alia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When authorities say it’s a national disaster, we can release international assistance, but that status has not been announced yet.”
When the second evening fell in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that light up gloomy natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue workers rescued a woman who was stuck for three days with his mother’s body next to him.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia's national screen flight team coach, had trained two of the missing screen flights before Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As the screen flight veteran, I have a very emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon said that the hours after the screenflights heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who took part in the beach festival.
But his messages only got a grey tray, instead of two blues.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Twenty takes $226 750 under bankomat refill at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $226 750 from a Brink's employee who filled a bankomat at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had lost a bankomat in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the message.
As he was busy, another man arose behind the Brink's co-workers and stole a bag of money that would be delivered.
The witness saw several suspected aircraft from the site, according to the press release, but the police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the guardians shall contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes her name to Ye
Kanye West's rapper changed his name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The event formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41,har was called Ye for a longer time and used the nickname as the title for its eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes within his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, which set out for "sensitive reasons" according to the creators of the program.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think that 'yes' is the word used most in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio values Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm we, that's us.
It went from Kanye, meaning 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of what we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without hyphens and verses.
Mexico’s AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico’s recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilian civilians now as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody convocation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
Threats fired weapons on a peaceful demonstration on the square on the second October 1968 and killed up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements hit the root of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has struggled to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate education opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the United States does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A double so big budget can double the chance that the next big AI breakthrough is done in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies - Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that hit the top-ranked American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China department.
Lee mentioned former U.S. government technology competitions, such as Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next one would be in order to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI," he said.
State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides grants to people at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations share money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on name change
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would solve a number of decades old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north constitutes a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments shut down an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he does not intend to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts as to whether the minimum 50 percent minimum vote required for the referendum will be considered valid will be reached.
The question of the vote in the referendum is as follows: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth changing names if it does so that Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, can join the EU and NATO.
“I’m here to vote for our country’s future, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, for this means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome for it to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last 2016 parliamentary election when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children's sake, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small scene and place out chairs in front of the tent set up by those who boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with the head in the air, not sneak in through the back door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, a membership in NATO would lead to substantial investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80 percent of our inhabitants are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said when he voted.
He said that a "Yes" result would be a "request of our future."
According to a survey published in Monday by the Macedonia Institute of Policy Surveys, between 30 and 43 percent of voters thought vote in the referendum, which falls under the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of participants were voting on Sunday.
70 percent of them thought they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be counted, 50 percent of registered voters plus a vote must be counted.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious backlash for the Western government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero takes care of Brighton's defenses to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's win of 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored goals for 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker received a pass from the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and embarked on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He took himself around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's goal range.
Then he put a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the target area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he made goals at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover of the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's reefs at that game.
He sent out a nice kick along the left side of the Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the away chair.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net moment before it ended out of reach.
City meets Hoffmannheim in the group game in the Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But the competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which is a match before the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still have a chance to end the game.
Rockies won a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
“We’re playing about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub rubber in science about the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to be there?”
Nationals have not announced their start for Sunday than, but according to reports, they are citing against allowing Scherzer to throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington's right-handed throwers are 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding talks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, when he talked about how important it is that Republicans vote in the upcoming Middle Ages Elections.
"All we've done is play in November.
We are five weeks from one of our most important choices.
This is one of the big, big... I can't do it, but I candder. That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see this happen here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever is required, you see their elasticity, secrecy.
They don’t care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That’s what they want, power and control. We won’t let them get it.”
Democrats, he said, struggle to "understand and prevent."
"You've seen the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "arga and elaka and terrible and false".
He mentioned the Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Judicial Committee, who was greeted by high busting from the spectators.
"You remember what she said?
"Did you leave the document?"
"Eh, eh, huh?
No, not, no, I'm expecting a ...' It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don’t tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
I am, after all, the latest in a series of MPs from Labour who hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way when she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for not keeping Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the safety of the nation, on Europe — ironically, similar topics such as Jeremy criticised earlier leaders.
The communication on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that "we want meetings to be welcoming and productive."
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "Friends, happier" policies has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly obvious that divergent views are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged based on whether the party's leaders accept it.
This immediately began after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues who I previously thought had a similar political view that I was expecting to make a whole reversal and take positions that I would otherwise never have kept in mind — whether it was the safety of the nation or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly — and it really doesn’t matter what I say — follow a ten-rad of the oven on social media that requires me to be put down, criticizes my policy and says that I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments aimed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when faced with a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this policy of yours is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church and with every disbelieving and change of the selection rules, the party becomes increasingly sensitive.
I have received many advice over the past two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight, so "order it."
But that was not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher's government's misconduct that literally got my primary school classrooms to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it the most, both at local level and as the prime minister of government.
I have never hidden my political views, and it includes the latest election.
No one in Nottingham East can somehow be confused with my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To you who promoted percussion on Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes against a Brexit that will damage households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency - both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat to dismissing me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result an aning, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now on top, the only unbeaten side of the ten.
Ultimately, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the profit, and coach Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in our matches so far and are still unbeaten, so we are so happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we were."
Grant Anderson's attempts in the 14:th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's try, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious injury to Ruaidh Knott, who was barred from the plan, and after the restart, the Ayr leadership again increased with a try from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose once again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for thanking Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-lineout behind Ayr's maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent off flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game stars seem ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still the Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been named as CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duon has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last season of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craigang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Avengers Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would enter Glasgow's "flowery restaurant firesch".
"Have belongs to us": Klaus Bolivia hopes that the court opens the way to the Pacific Ocean again
Seamen patrol a rigged headquarters for the Navy in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The bases of the fleet from Titicaca Lake to Amazon bear the motto: "Havet belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In coastalless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains strong - and it is also the desire to regain the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is higher than in several decades now when Bolivia expects a decision from the International Court of Justice on the first October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a mood of unity and peace, and then unexpectedly expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many bolivians will see the international court's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Court of the Hague will judge in favor of Bolivia's demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, will have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to have their own outlet to the sea.
Monday’s decision also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is incredible that the court will judge Bolivia's advantage, and that not much would change even if it does.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, has no right to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final argument suggests that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And in the past four years, it may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia’s chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been capped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She argues that Morales aggressive rhetoric has painfully on Chile's remaining well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Before this President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not think that the court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will "an outstanding opportunity to launch a new era for the relationship with Chile" and a chance to "set a stop for 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the issue of the sea as a political cry.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
“The end is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not defeat its nuclear weapons first if they can’t rely on Washington.
He spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the border to solve the death situation of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a “want dream” to continue sanctions and US protests against a statement that the end of the Korean War will ever end North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree with the statement without Pyongyang first beginning significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really thinks of with a gun arsenal that the country is likely to see as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest line huge main housing on the way to stores near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a variety of knasiga, oversized main dwellings for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which bled the styles of Paris fashion week.
Amazingly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designs have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like wide hat-bread that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even an ananas - but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, for some time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had folded lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
A creation resembled a wet suit with snore and dive mask, and another looked like a melted glass frame.
And if you continue the huge courage, you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge horticultures can be on the way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba - the straw hat with a 60 cm breech that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratakijkowski.
The brand that was behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another great creation on the catwalk - a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The Raffa bag in terracotta, with electrofiafrans and a white leather handle, excelled in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I’m waiting to see big hats and beach bags in the stores next summer — the designer has had such a huge impact that it would be difficult to ignore demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills crucial to global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools retain outstanding academic results and this continued 2018 with yet another set of outstanding results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective advances in sports, art, music and other community gigs.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers, and their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement custom curriculums, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and requested topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we can not only rely on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that language is highest in the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received A in the Higher Grade final exam.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish were also given an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills such as children and young people without hesitation will need in the future.
Language as subject choice is now considered to be as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics on curriculums in independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that employers for various reasons had difficulty filling their vacancies, with 17 percent attributed to a lack of skills in language.
With this said, language skills are all more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more future jobs that require language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have an appeal for a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult British published by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent said they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that total appeared in a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in languages that are considered most important to the UK for 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within detached schools, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a teaching environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future has on the line.
In a global economic environment, there is no doubt the language that continues to be crucial to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James making their debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Laker’s official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers’ preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games in this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump makes his first campaign event tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned performances in the next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In waiting for a confirmatory vote of his candidate to the highest court’s vacant post, Trump aims to build support for upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress before the upcoming November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s interrogation of the candidate to the highest court Brett Kavanaugh, who was sent after accusations of his sexual assault, with an expected delay in the vote from the Senate up to a week while the FBI’s investigation into the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November election.
Thus, President Trump said that these five gatherings in the next week are aimed at "engaging volunteers and supporters when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that would not be named for Reuters.
Night events, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can drag fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has hailed in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come there to try to give him an increase in public opinion polls," said Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep the hopes of life ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the pair competitions on Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The movement's swinging pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before, for competitions like these.
So what moment is it about now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so we carry it as a small moment I guess,” said Jordan Spieth when he finished the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points of advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have little wind in the sail, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points of four each.
Spieth has been watered from tea to green and preceded by good examples.
The Vinstrophe shook even higher when his lap continued and he lowered a decisive cut to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had been left with two after two games.
His cut that won them the match of 15 met with a similar twist, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes for victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup’s undeniably story.
Europe’s extinct but adorable couples are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bookbook on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and audience reactions state that they are players to turn on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could comb home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the fireball hero of the morning, along with Alex Noren.
A bookey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they never even came close to calling off.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and waterfalls are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between the couple, they advise they don’t give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this waterfall session also showed that Team USA has a blasphemy as some, especially on the United States side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on the Ryder Cup’s last day after coming out of Saturday’s ball and waterfalls matched with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a mastery Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who fought to keep the trophy that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got started in the morning's fireball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the waterfall and won two games, but it didn’t run for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single-matchs to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Milliwood", after a sensational weekend, is just the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fireball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryce Dechambeau with an even more oppressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, showed samples at occasional moments of the brilliant, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in ball and waterfalls, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested in the morning's fireball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in waterfalls to a 2 & 1 season over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe had not helped the whole way, but it was a nice, windy day just south-west of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fireball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in waterfalls after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from an underscore of four points in the single match, however, Furyk’s side needs only one undetermined result to keep the trophy.
After being the second best in two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says the "never" will be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust over the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "better measures to show its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear weapons and missile tests, dismantle the installations for nuclear weapons tests and not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technologies.
“We don’t see any equivalent response from the United States,” he said.
“Without some confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated well-preserved North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to an approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would lead North Korea to be rewarded when it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject unilateral nuclear weapon resolution entirely as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim promised to work against the "determination of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first break its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also called for no negotiations to facilitate harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "recovery first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose through force and even opposes the "the declaration of ending the war", says Ri.
“The notion that sanctions can get us on the knees is a desire for the people who lack knowledge about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump as US leaders highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the party in this issue of nuclear disarmament had been South Korea and not the United States, the Korean nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a deadly state.”
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different than last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the United States mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "held destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarming, but said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this and said that “if it takes two years, three years or five months,” he doesn’t matter.
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that: "The retention of security council sanctions must continue with force and without failure until we realize a complete, definitive, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to crush the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of setting "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile plant and also a nuclear complex if the U.S. adopted "against measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "motivated measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and is moving towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has received all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "deepenings."
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often uncomfortable when it comes to the basics of how to deal with them.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first in his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why can’t I know this until now, during my last year?’”
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, organized for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academically and athletic performance, as well as improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University’s Health Services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The timing of the course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants get to know how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it won’t change students’ behavior right away.
But we think they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
The strength culture of "deep" still exists, he says and allows modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain as insomnia puts the brain in a snoring mode and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider putting an alarm for when to sit and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn on the clock, leading to insomption problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas goal lowers Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0-round team in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home his first victory on the road since February 4-1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers never managed to smooth out the result.
While the Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more problems with the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semi-finals of Betfred Cup.
Holt on the other hand went with the same Livi 11 who took a score of Hearts last week and he would have been happy with the way his well-married game overlorded the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes into the match when Mengas first pass released through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A free kick at the depth of Keaghan Jacobs then reached the team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear chair.
Rangers took control of the match, but it seemed to be more hope than belief in their game during the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo felt he should have had a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson turned away the colombian's call.
Rangers managed only two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily welcomed Lassana Coulibalysnick and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis openings in 34 minutes must go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their kinsman deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob’s firm situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher matched Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose Menga for a single break.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the change gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit Morelos' ball, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponent to play exactly the type of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swung up long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened its lead in the final stage, but McGregor was well prepared to prevent Jacobs from falling outside the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late claim of punishment when he was defeated with Jacobs, but once again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "His" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manick called Geigermeter.
Geiger meters have become a foundation for science since then and also form a major part of pop culture, as well as in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado", starring in the seemingly unlikely Cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
“What in the world is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: “Yes, it pops up now!”
"His" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms and then re-injected
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancer forms.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw their ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "remains the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learn" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by carrying a MAGA kit, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was cut out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swaming appearance where he promised US President Donald Trump and said he himself would be able to run for the post 2020 post.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great picks, he rallied against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on the accusations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's posting was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to drive West with the post.
West had also appealed to the public that he had been harassed backstage for his headbone.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that keps."
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm sinking low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you also want to sink low?" and said he would "set my supermancape on, because that means you can't say what I can do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Test with love."
His comments attracted more cages at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed to be re-classified, Variety reported. One person said: "There was a death toll in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West broke many of his performances with the song I Love It, dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: TACK FOR ATT YOU STOOD ON YOU MOBEN."
But the host of the chat show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and it's wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") that I think embrace and spread an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's what we're doing, she added.
Before the show announced the rapper on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the warning previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkolian, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased musical Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Dom for murder attempt after knife cutting at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of murder attempts after a man stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to enter Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington beats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-smoothing role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to respect.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity under #MeToo-eran.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, acknowledged that he feels "very strong" to address the problem.
"I feel personally pretty strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What's inflated and what's intelligible?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel like they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not make any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer and says he is "clear with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played the character Jon Snow in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% of the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people have been affected in the country, says health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transferred via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected by HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an acute issue in China’s HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the infection cases depend on insufficient protection in association with these relationships.
China’s government has since 2003 promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of the efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters insists that staff leaked GOP senator's data, pushing for "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Ladies, lies, and more dreadful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information contained in the task addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The ship came once after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Purdit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water’s office and released the information about a member of Water’s staff, Hill reported.
“This and rounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This and rounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Water’s statement quickly received criticism online, including from White House’s former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they won’t be angry.
They can't be daunting.
They may not question the motives of the subject.
They must be calm and sensed.”
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction with the critique of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who criticised for acting angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who candidate to dismiss Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities for these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Recension of Johnny English Strikes Again - Powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit services in every new film with British chanting, and the same seems to apply to this remake of the latest Johnny English action comedy - a series of spy parodys who kicked out 2003 with Johnny English and got a new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will water set out how clearly bad we are to become the nation’s new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber chart has received its license that clans to the case be renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for biopublic even in non-English-speaking countries
Of course, he is the strange secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims on smoothieglamour, has received a small bit of Clouseau, a gnutt Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to OS in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There is one or two nice moments in the latest JE film
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in an medieval armor and when the rotor blade briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy appears, but humor feels quite low-weight and strangely superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humor feels like it’s adapted to children instead of adults and for me, Johnny English is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film empires in the role of Bean.
The current topic is now that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain’s agents out in fields, to the agent of the service’s great dissatisfaction - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this quis-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence advisor informs her that when every single active spy is busy, she must use someone who retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in any charitable institution, but which offers unofficial lessons in the art to work undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with its former long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine crew, a jolly hockey stick-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terriblely wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five-legged Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic techmiller, who claims he can solve the UK’s computer crisis: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin his odyssé of father-traught uphills: dressed to waitresses, they set fire on a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle aboard Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when trying to use a VR headset to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
It is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and speedy, it has an air of children-TV around it.
Pretty moderate everything as everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour refuses to draw up a plan for Brits to work a four-day week but receive five-day pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's party of Labour is considering a radical plan that assumes the British are working a four-day week - but is paid for five.
The party, according to the task, wants business leaders to transfer savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra free day.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "pass" with the party's economic agenda in favor of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A representative higher in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen in a day, but a four-day work week is a quest that fits into the party’s attitude to balance the economy in favor of the workers and the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the party The Greens who promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this objective is not listed by Labour as a whole.
A spokesperson for Labour said: “A four-day work week is not the party’s policy and it’s nothing that the party agrees with.”
Shadows John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from "unsolved leaders" and "snowers" on state companies.
The plan of the shadow whistleblower also means that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get back all their efforts, as a Labour government can make "disruption" because of what they perceive has been incorrect actions.
He also confirmed plans to put workers in corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds, where 10 percent of the private company's own capital is left to its employees, which then stands to receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell in the TV program "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their opinions
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the highest court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could have a few Republican senators to change the position on the matter.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unknowingly."
However, Graham’s voice seems irrefutable.
“I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamism idea,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it heavily," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all she names could not verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new change.”
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive display of stars appearing and an equally impressive mission; to combat world domination.
Now during its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people opt for the Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goals of the event: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 statement, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pre-language group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "measures" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or in other meaningful ways help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clickivism" - people who feel they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters who struggled for a variety of goals.
These measures have helped track world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect life for more than $225 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and the announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the collected assets have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors who are committed to "helping children to develop into their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the area after gaining more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just as you can, we can make social injustices as an insult to a footnote in history,” said the ambassador for the Tracey Ullman partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken, the UK will improve the cost of mothers and children, announced government funding of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes dietary programs aimed at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on his website: “What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?”
Global Quote: "It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements within us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists appearing at this year's events in New York, whose hosts are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports from entering the interior minister
The government can “in need” attract its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, US interior minister Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it appears at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, Europe’s southern parts,” he said.
And according to him there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability to, with our fleet, ensure that the maritime routes are kept open and, if necessary, apply blockade, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to participants in the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group calling itself the voice of the “energy consumer” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are really the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “day arrival” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statement comes after the Trump administration has been aiming to increase exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump’s administration’s officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow Moscow’s “catcher.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think that we share the notion that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position received backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I strongly dislike a third party disrupting our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she is to set up in the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts Senator says.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the US mid-year election.
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix our busy government and it includes a woman on top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will take a real thinker to go to the president’s post.”
Warren headed into President Donald Trump during the Town Hall meeting and said he "take this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been free-language in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We obviously need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe she would be able to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not be able to validate, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The study showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking a siege in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son goes through, what he's going through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and part of the trauma that our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a meeting meeting meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they will return like other people, they come back here, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military, have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempting to prevent a report of violence in the home and gun possession of the intoxicated state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, as well as the District of Columbia support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Arton states and the District of Columbia support a judicial trial aimed at a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who flee gang-related violence or violence at home.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a free-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
Full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang members," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
States lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and violence at home.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed a decision of the 2014 Immigration Authorities that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed based on specific facts and circumstances that the claim applies, and such provision is contrary to that principle," the freeend-of-the-court report said.
Lawyers further claimed in the report that policies denying the entry of immigrants are damaging the American economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "liver the necessary labour force."
The Secretary-General Jeff Sessions ordered in June a judge in asylum cases not to grant asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion,” Sessions said when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperata rescue efforts in Palu when the death penalty is doubled in pursuit of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked gloomy.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his bold boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
“Ambulance picks dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a lack of water.”
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rotting through water-damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake at 7.5 were overwhelming.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was affected by a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the hospital of Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershocks.
With tears filled eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room in the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t fly.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided ad in an American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China's Daily paying a supplement in Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of attempting to engage in the US's 6th congressional election, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with high tariffs on each other's imports.
China's charter tariffs in the early trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa supporting the Republican Party, this according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article on Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “Now the bullying, by putting out propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“China’s government uses America’s dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertising ads in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the newspaper Greek on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economy, as the media is controlled by iron hand by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers nobbed the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare female voters before the mid-year election through Kavanaugh fiasco, warns analysts
Since many top Republicans defend the Supreme Court’s nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several accusations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming election.
The sentiments surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they are in the election.
It is not possible to turn back the clock, says Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) last attempt to an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, demonstrating "November comes!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans controlling the Court Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go to the roof,” said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, despite the fact that they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Already before Ford’s public testimony with allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confusing move for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the Committee’s vote or final vote or if Kavanaugh comes through, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her,” Guy Cecil, head of Priories USA, pointed out.
However, Americans generally seem to be divided over who they should believe in the wake of Fords and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford has performed, as well as those from at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court exposed her genital organs to her while attending a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data big" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, making lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available in a web browser at the same time.
What’s unique about the personal online data storage is that it’s completely up to the user who can access the type of information.
The company calls it "personally authorised through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company will bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers who are working with the project and a group of volunteers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don’t talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change in which all business models are placed at the top of a night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded with Viktoria choirs during World War I
The only priest in the English Church who was rewarded with a Victoria choir during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann won the award for his acting under the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious price of the British military.
A memorial was uncovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "brilliant symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his father was rewarded with the price.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann, on 29 September 1918, led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later ran up to the Scots line and led with the "great bravery" line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his father's actions were "something that I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble in front of."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also put down a crane after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "knowed very honored to play a role in the parade" and allowed "a genuine hero to be demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got to watch Greta Gris
Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 matches, including sex on the main card and showed live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were very impressed after they had stayed awake to the early morning hours to watch the match.
A Twitter fan described the program change to a cartoon child program as "a sick joke."
"It was the government's decision that the content was not as early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president for marketing and communication when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes"
Bellator’s CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution in terms of the price," Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won’t be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change upset many.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
In fact, it was a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our head in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "underly" due to sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt his subjects under his upbringing due to his sexuality - but he also tracked him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he did not realize that he was not like everyone else until he attended high school.”
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said he cared less about winning OS after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular programme leader, Kirsty Young, has taken vacant a few months due to illness.
During his one-time performance at Laverne's first program, Daley tells us how he felt "less worth" than others during his upbringing, that "it was not socially acceptable to think of boys and girls."
He said: “This feeling of feeling less worthy and feeling differently has been a real source of power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't bother everyone when they eventually got to find out about his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for HBT rights and took advantage of his appearance at the Commonwealth Games of Australia in order to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he took the words because he felt like he had been lucky to live openly without limitations and would give other "hope".
The three-time world champion said that his love in a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "come as a surprise."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much in such a young age,” he participated in his first OS at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age of similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
“But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
“My gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had received their tickets for the 2012 London Olympic Games - where he would sit in the first row.
“I couldn’t say to him: you won’t be able to sit on front row dad,” he said.
“I kept his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
This year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home audience at an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him to OS and still gave him fame.

Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's football and waterfalls.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting cheers and training on his game in hopes of getting a chance to show up his ability.
He has never been the strongest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in the form of the tough banana at Le Golf National, where the long ruffle often punishes hard.
It’s not just the banana that deters, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson meets champion Francesco Molinari, who together with novice Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below the 12 single-games have won at first, Mickels’ match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on my back and let my arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“His self-confidence is nothing wrong with it.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn’t think he would be able to play two matches.
I thought he'd do more, but now it's what it is and we'll be able to enjoy it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson passes Nick Fallo's record for most Ryder Cup match-maker.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, but Furyk said that his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, mercury, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just playing.”
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big wire can soon be a memory
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under the Selve Ballesteros leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but ultimately won by a minimum margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we led great on Valderrama, we led great on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with emergency and vinegar," Bjorn said, after seeing 2018's class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, leading by 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we give everything.
Going out and doing everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this pokal and that’s where our focus lies.
I’ve said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of what’s waiting on the other side — the best players in the world.”
Björn was pleased with his players' performances on a tough golf course and added: "I would never cope with this myself.
Tomorrow we are expecting new challenges.
Tomorrow is the individual performance that applies, and that’s a completely different matter.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re out there on your own, your capacity is tested as a golfer fully.
It is the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Björn, the opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major reversals in the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended as losers when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to go out as fast as on Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the pace starts on the one hand, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediates.
We made our setup and placed the guys that we wanted to, you know, to create some magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the game and meets Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
“I went with this group of guys in this scheme because I think it’s enough all the way,” Bjorn said about his single choice.
Germany's new warship is re-established
The latest frigate of the German fleet was scheduled to have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, local media reported.
The operation of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the lead ship for the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg reigns, has now been postponed up to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were devastating to the ambitious project.
The four ships in Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen rules.
They will include a powerful gun, a range of air heater and sea meter missiles, as well as some sneakers, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already outdated when they are taken into operation, Die Zeit said.
The fateful F125 retreat created headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media indicated a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship worthless if it was used on a combat mission.
Brewers in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It also emerged that the ship has a significant excess, leading to impaired performance and limiting the Navy's ability to carry out future upgrades.
The 7,000 tonnes tongue "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project’s price tag, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
It is said to have been up to €1.3 billion (3.6 billion) compared to €2.2 billion in the start.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s maritime power is reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "should get a lack of fully equipped ships".
The official said that it is a growing problem, as old ships are interrupted, but no replacement ships were provided.
He remarked that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust theft lights to the secret life of the batsman
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how flat muds use the landscape in their hunting for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help control future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow south and dwarf pipe conductors as well as brown lenders and Daubenton flat mudslides at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special players will be placed in important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bats noise and what species do what.
A life environment map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Natural Health Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of life environment are most important for the bat and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of life-environment management work such as the creation of meadows and how to best maintain forest fields for flat mud and other related species.
Flattermus populations in Scotland and the UK have significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects the bon and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks from hedges.
In fact, gossip is not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated echo localization technique to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 77,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flat mudslides seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, examine bon and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only dedicated flat pitch reserve at Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home for eight of Scotland’s ten flattermus species.
The property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
“Here at Threeave we have a good area for flat mudslides,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, lots of winter trees and a variety of favorable habitats.
But there’s a lot about flat mud that’s still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He emphasizes the importance of searching for flat mudslides before performing maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly trigger a whole population.
Faddermöss is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their bon.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flat-ditches and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are feeling."
Ronaldo rejects rape violence while his lawyers threaten to vote for the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him for "false news" and says that people "will market" by using his name.
His lawyers will meet the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal's and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375.000 to keep silent about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) reported the reports as “false news” when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the requirements were reported.
“No no no no no.
What they said today was fake news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
“They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it’s part of the job.
“I am a happy man and everything good,” said the player and log.
Ronaldos lawyers are preparing to meet Der Spiegel over the claims, which they have called "an unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount equivalent to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights over the past few years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where, according to the task, he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" the betrayal of the "last percent".
According to the document, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because she felt "fearing for relief" and was worried that "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to repeal the settlement because she continues to traumatize by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: Britain "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
The UK "will regret it forever" if you lost its status as a world leader in automotive production after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "oranding" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement they will temporarily cease production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event that no contract ended could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avenis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory,” says Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other British automakers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini facility in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problem is what car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is run on "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming from 37: minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it can lead to disruptions at the border that the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day of consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and hence production would be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid controls at the border".
“We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that enables, as I say, not just success currently being appreciated, but for us to take this opportunity.” he told BBC Radio 4:s program Today.
“The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increasing costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite Staff Association at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
A government official said: “We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein would be able to “ask for another week” while the fight against the highest court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein monitors the work of specialist advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the Deputy Justice Minister, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's floods for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying cancellation equipment to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, and reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced, which was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, which will be held on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "before" not kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with Senate Legal Committee interrogations in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual ingenuity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been established, it can happen this week, or a delay with a week considering all other matters happening at the highest court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would contest the claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any dislike to TV reporters as "playing for the gallery," although she said: "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She said direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds several petitions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do this often and you’ve seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it’ll replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the United States president.”
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president perhaps showed why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the gathered reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland, taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of discontinued status applications for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, before decisions expected to come in autumn.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for you all.
That is why I want to repeat how much I value each employee’s effort, regardless of nationality.
Collectors from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves health care and benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after he suffered from head injury
Tennessee State Tigers lineback Christion Abercrombie passed an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday's loss with 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the damage occurred just before half time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie acid on the sideline before being placed on a stretcher was carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no data on the type/conception of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the match, giving him a season number of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers get to pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to Tory Party’s new plans
The action should neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The rise of the stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The British Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers should pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The action will be perceived as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with the promise of housing with more affordable prices and aiming at high incomes.
The rise of the stamp tax will be taken out of individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will be given a shot at the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee will be added in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and homes purchased to be rented out. It can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will take up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimates 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK. This drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing market.
Many charities in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new game will only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the score tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and called on Theresa May to refrain from quotas on housing with affordable prices to solve Britain’s “big residential situation”.
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a lookoutful enough proposal for housing reforms, including tenants and an end to bills without the tenant's blame.
He also wants to give the municipalities a greater opportunity to build new homes.
Theresa May says: “Last year I said I would devote my time as prime minister to re-establish the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it can’t be right when it’s as easy for people who don’t live in the UK, and even for companies that are based abroad, to buy homes as too hard working residents in our country.
The dream of owning their home has too many people become just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an invaluable fact.”
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his “complete goal” is to ever become Scotland’s coach.
The 42-year-old shot looks forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from north-eastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in summer after being led by St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
“I played a match in the B team and it was all,” Ross told BBC Scotland Sportssound.
“But when I grew up I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my father, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I succeed in leading a club.”
Among Ross’s representatives as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding so established names in such a big club. He has previously thanked no offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Just now, am I considering success based on the answer to the question, ‘Can I get this club back to the Premier League?’
“This club is definitely at home in the Premier League, considering its structure and talents,” he says.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d just see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period of assistant coaching in Dumbarton and a 15-month tenure as a member of Hearts coach team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from the descent to the third division, lifting St Mirren from being close down to becoming the winner of the championship season there.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a road cause," he recalls and aims at when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was right for me, in a completely different way than to play.
It sounds weird, because I had good results and could live hypnotizing on it. In addition, I had some great successes.
Playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels right.
I've always wanted to exercise and now I'm doing better than I've ever done in my entire adult life."

A survey shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
In the summer’s heat wave, revenues for the country’s struggling pubs have increased, but the restaurant chains have gained greater pressure on themselves.
Siffror showed that pub and bar concerts increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurants revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the corporate consulting company CGA, who has compiled the figures, said: “Consent beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected that we had seen a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%. The restaurants still got even more difficulty.
The decrease in restaurant sales by 1.8% in June was just worse in July.
Pubar and bars, which in particular offer drinks, showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubar which offers food had it also difficult in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seem to have wanted to go out and drink something.
The impact on managed pubs and bars went up to 6.6% on the month, and food sales dropped by 3%."
Paul Newman on the server and entertainment industry analyst RSM says: “These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in sales in the large-scale market.
There is no surprise that the restaurant concerts still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% every year is particularly difficult to handle beyond ongoing cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come any more inconvenient to companies driven by food sales. The time will show out about the more moderate temperatures that we have had in August gives some well-needed revitalization."
The total sales increase on pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was at 2.7% in July. It reflects the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyzes data on how it goes for 47 active groups with a total turnover of more than £9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
A survey shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11, have secret accounts on social media as they hide for their parents and teachers.
A survey among 20,000 students at high school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concern that sexual content is being put up there.
20% of students said they had a “head account” that they showed to their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they hold secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the photo sharing service Instagram.
The result has been concerned about the fact that it is sexual content posted there.
20% of students said they have a cleaned “head account” that they can show to their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager calling for others to "kill me."
According to the study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) organizations, 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" of the Board of Directors of the Scottish athletics association, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been admitted to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her broad experience at international level in the past decade.
"Eididh has won great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are confident that the sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from being a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle says: “I’d like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can help and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time was given out if I would recover, and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’ve recovered completely, taught me to go back and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing moms with how parts of the internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused differences on the internet with an ad comparing breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
To pay attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump" consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial film with humorous estimates to show what freedom the new pump provides mammary pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a autumn-filled lady with choirs for a song with lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but have no tails" and "If you didn't know it, this is no juves, but cuts."
The chorus continues: "Pumpa out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial film, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it throws light over the dairy industry’s “phases.”
"A very bad decision to use where to market this product.
Just like we have to get pregnant and born to produce milk, but their kids are taken from them just a few days after birth,” a person writes.

Another comments: “You understand that it’s traumatic to both mom and children.
But, sure, why not use them to make advertising for a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?”
Another add-on: “Women of reality reject commercials.”
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysteric fun."
"I think this is brilliant.
I would have bought one if I were still breast-feeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The advertising film is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“This is a brilliant product,” someone writes.
Another comments: “This is a fun commercial that turns to moms who pump (often at the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cossor’.”
This is not a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the behån.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a nursing booth, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD on Mother, and she says: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk baskets, we would put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while at a entertaining and light-recognizable way, showing the incredible freedom of mind the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk with clothes by designer Marta Yakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved in silence to a tent camp near Texas border
The number of detainees displaced migrant children has been shot at the height even though the number of people crossing the border every month is relatively unchanged. This is partly due to the fact that domestic rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the government of Trump have made it harder to place the children in reference people.
In the past, most reference people themselves have been paperless immigrants, saving their own opportunities to stay in the country on games by explaining willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would have to leave fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a higher official on the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified before Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had sought to be reference persons of single-parent minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities ever before.
"Nearly 80% of those who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to pursue these individuals,” Albence said.
In order to deal with children's cases faster, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be found in the right within a month after the detention of freedom, rather than after 60 days, which were previous practices, according to staff on the grounds.
Many of them are currently on video link rather than personally in order to bring their speech to legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered to be entitled to protection are quickly deported.
The longer children are the more likely to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or refugee attempts, according to staff on the investigations and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Speakers say the concern is rising at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has a difficult more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the plant.
They add that if children are moved to the tent site without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and take the goodbye of friends, they may already be engaged.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish "coupruption forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be handled in accordance with this."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, with more than 300,000 people dead since 2011, and millions left their homes.
He said that the government of Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The U.S. has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly educate and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1 000 soldiers on the ground in the war-defended country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home and accused "certain Western countries" to "spread irrational fear" that enables refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They are talking about something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to rebuild to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel-held Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement ruled a large-scale attack of Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem emphasized that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed towards jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaeda-connected Nusra Front, who "will be loaned out."
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition, to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee and said that the work of the group would be limited to "a review of the articles of the present Constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election if his presidency is not finished in the past through impeachment and scandal, which many liberal viewers probably hope for.
In what no doubt would be "the most dramatic final of a presidency ever!"
There are no signs that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has peaked the charts for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during big news nights.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designed Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a long-time co-author and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he would vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" says Nell Scovell for me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Obviously, unlike anything else on TV, reporting from Washington can determine the future of the abortion issue, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Closing off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when suddenly you have suttit and looked for six hours at an expert panel that debates Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of strutsläder for $15,000 ("a garment filled with hybries", as Washington Post said and the meaning of Stormy Trumpar's mas mas pasar, by Donald Trump'sar.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Some of what he does makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's rotating roll-up and daily intrigue (muckled with NFL, Mayor Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single paragraph, you'll be on the cover.
When I spoke to television producer Mr Floiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai, Hawaii, but he sat and hung indoors and watched MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He could not resist, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be put before the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the wave bowl.
“I remember when we did all those crazy programs in time and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Mr. Floiss told me.
"I thought there was some kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Money from outside currents into the most common race ever before in the mid-year election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district takes a lot of money, thanks to a restructuring of a congressional district that has now competed for the same place.
This recently re-edited suburban district in Pittsburgh is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who received his seat in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigned against another member, Republican Keith Rothfuss. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were re-written after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the Republicans' advantage.
The opening of the new 17th district has caused a campaign funding dispute between the major parties' economic sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a button profit in a wide-screen special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain start.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support but back then
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the part-owners were ousted the Trump organization's leadership team.
Officials at the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "news decided not to recognise Taiwan," said the ministry spokesperson Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, were planned, among other things, to go to drug control and development and constitute financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit hard against the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
At the same time as the internal meetings delayed, U.S. and Central American officials set up a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials in the administration made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which effectively put a stop for the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October. This is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton of the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, described by the three U.S. officials, of whom two diplomats agreed to discuss the internal proceedings against promises of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outsider analyst who is close to the administration and who also made an anonymous statement.
Study History
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged abuse in law, as there is now tangible evidence for public records.
Mueller is also reported to control his investigation into whether Donald Trump’s campaign was working with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If Congress were to change the majority, Trump will be held accountable for that assembly just as he prepares to once more set up in the election, and perhaps finally before a citizen's jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to meet different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the extract the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and set himself behind the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of blood baths that followed.
The story revolves around such crucial events, and the inconvenient progress of democracy is either slowing down or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what is going to happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this magazine reported that he had proposed to secretly record the president, and speculated that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is not true.
“How should we respond to the newly asked FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to attend the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote for a congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is facing a dark period.
But I don’t think we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, migrated to the United States and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath light on the table that was decorated with the chin choir.
With what inheritance, how could I be more than optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorans in Rangers is excited about the meeting with Rapid Wien
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal, which ended undecided earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from making his first appearance for the season, until 2-2-match against Villarreal. But he believes Rangers can use the result as a snoring board against greater successes.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the match in the belief that we could get something, and went from there with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten it in at the end, but at the end it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came back in the second half and it was the better team.
On Thursday, it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us we can safely run out and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The squad is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and succeed well.”
Women sleep poorly because of fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be cared for, few were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they had spoken to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is how you can start.
Talk to your spouse/make and children: You can’t prepare your family to give you care if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may be of great importance to the costs.
Using your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a hybrid solution with life insurance with cash value to cover costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford.
Establish legal acts: Avoid legal battles from the beginning.
Establish a healthcare provider so that you can appoint a trusted person looking over your medical care and make sure that the healthcare professionals follow your desires, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also an authority for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure your bills are paid if you are unable.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is in an emergency medical condition and is heading to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such details so you are ready.
“It’s not just the economy that stands at stake, but what are the doctors?” Martin asked.
“What medications are they?”
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready.”
Ilfracombe air conditioner
A man was shot several times with air rifles when he pushed home from a night out.
The victim, aged 40, was found in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "sense event".
The victim did not see his attacker.
The damage is not life-threatening, and the police urge witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday.
Communications are rash, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the management area of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of Earth. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Centrala Sulawesi, and is located in a crowded bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The town's population was estimated at 3,797,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a management area that stretches along more than 300 km of north-west Sulawesis coast.
The electoral area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 people.
The caves in the province of Centrala Sulawesis economics are fishing and agriculture, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickelgruv operation is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Western Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circum-Pacific seismic fire, often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the West coast of the Indonesian Aceh province on the north coast of Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries. 226 000 people died along Indian Ocean coasts. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A earthquake with magnitude 7.6 struck near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Västra Sumatra.
More than 1 in 100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten metres was triggered. dozens of cities were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A ground earthquake affected the administrative area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that razed together.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska Governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been accused of abuse.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, for being put in a notice of domestic violence and for having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska state police.
According to the police report, he has taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin sits in the Mat-Su hood and is held against the city of $500 to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the city, according to the KTUU TV channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "garantly not guilty" when he was asked to give up his attitude, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of minor serious crimes under Class A, which means he can get jail for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a fall of minor serious crimes under class B, which is punishable by a day in prison and $20,000 in fines.
This is not the first time that Palin was accused of crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being handled by Alaska's veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, in order to put himself in custody of domestic violence and for the possession of weapons under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stres syndrome, stemming from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after a earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The supply and communication are down, and the death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi, located north-east of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Movies showing when it hit circles now on social media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunamine struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors commit rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are guilty of the death penalty for Sayyfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist assassination in New York who killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been committed to a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, should have used a rental car from the building and interior chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He emailed down pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "invisible" killed the eight victims and "invisible" caused severe bodily damage, according to the intentional declaration of death penalty lodged in the Southern District in New York.
Both charges may involve a death sentence, according to the court action.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, often used by federal prosecutors in the target of organised crime, as well as abuse and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "wide planning and upturning," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as "disputable, cruel and inhuman."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadd, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco hurt and loss," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's southern district has not been charged with a goal in which it is sentenced to death on a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two nuns, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was carried out in a federal goal in New York City in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of trafficking in spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple Rosenberg was both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an uzbek citizen, appeared in the court document a lack of wings during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators he was satisfied with what he had done.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS movies on his phone.
He also asked to set up the IS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He has not pleaded guilty to the 22 charges in the eighteenth.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders who represents Saipov. He stated that they are "givenly disappointed" on the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose on death penalty instead of going to life imprisonment without the possibility of arbitrary release if the accused admits guilty only prolongs trauma caused by these events to all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to commit the death penalty.
Members of the Parliament of Tories say that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said the politicians must "recognise the threat" of the EU-Politics, when one of Theresa May's own MEPs suggested he would lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative member Peter Bone said at the March in Birmingham that Britain had already "scultly gone out" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge that Theresa May faces in getting the deeply divided supporters to be reconciled has worsened by EU-positive tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, in life under the attacks of Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU themselves.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to make an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash, forcing the EU skeptic and Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "caos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he would "spola Chequers agreement".
He pointed out that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and had responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the root, we would have been out at this team," he said.
Peter Bone, representing the district of Wellingborough in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to spola the Chequers deal."
He made clear his opposition to the EU and said, "We have not fought World War II to be underscored.
We want to build our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The fact that the British would have changed and now wants to stay completely unscathed."
Brexit supporters Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party were also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers Agreement is impopular to the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is impopopular in the party and in our electoral workers who are out on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Put away the Chequers agreement and start listening.”
And she added a sharp message directed to Theresa May: “Prime ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they hold their promises.”
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must be “recognized” if they were to betray the decision taken in and with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about the trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, 'We're not going to let you get away with it.'
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilize the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and held a two-hour mass meeting in central town.
A group of activists fanged with orbits with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour Parliamentary Lord Adonis of the House of Lords taunted the Conservatives for the security issues they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
“These people say they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus the plus deal, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a clean father.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans a "ordinary thinker" to be able to go to the president's post
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "ordinary thinker about going to the presidential post" after the November election.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke of his future during a City Hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who served as Deputy Chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been subject to speculation that she may be taking on Donald Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city hall meeting with voters since Donald Trump attended.
A person asked her if she planned to be a candidate for the president's post.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our defiant government. That means a woman at the top."
A person arrested for the death penalty of basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death penalty by LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who appears on the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot dead in his head and finally of this," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been on the spot and had a weapon, and he acknowledged that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and was arrested at the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Cup after team orders made him win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and nearly hung out Hamilton on a square when he defended his position during the first two wings, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went in the first place and allowed Hamilton to drive into the bottom of the cloth, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went on a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free of risk to bid in place after a double draw to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and lay seven at the end of his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held in the deck to reach a quick finish and drive about Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
At the end of the day, he came to the deck of 44th, but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight centuries when the Raikkon went up in fourth place.
It’s a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who released me.
“The team has done an exceptional job and got one and two,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diana Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, for she acknowledged that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for a judge in the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual assault.
The president, speaking at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address the testimony of Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "elaka, nasty and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that has happened in the past few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, elaka, nasty and lying," he said.
"You see the press releases and leaks and then they say, 'No, I haven't done it.
I haven't done that."
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Diane Feinstein?
Remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Wait a minute.
"If we leaked... No, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't dark Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I held it confidential, as she desired."
But her dementia doesn't seem to have fit the president, who during Saturday night's meeting commented: "I'm going to say it's a matter. That was really bad body language.
She may not have done that, but that was the worst body language I have ever seen.”
The president continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual offences by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power with all the necessary means.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to gain power and control,” said the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars performed Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-story lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie ridden the home team before Dwyer re-established Belfast Giant's management.
Francois Bouchard resigned for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefe's team, which came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting for the season for the two teams, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford gave assist when Beauvillier doubled the wire four minutes later.
During the intensive first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie, who received it at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants lay in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouched once again with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half way through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
However, pilots for hundreds of people on a plane could fly from Earthquake
A plane leader in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he saw that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the bay in the town of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues flying for his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the starting track, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would race.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of people’s lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We are amazed to hear this,” he added.
At the same time, authorities have warned that the death penalty could rise to over a thousand people. The country’s disaster relief authority says that it is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"Death beef is believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in assistance and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
It's bad for clean water.
Mini markets are everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to meet with there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse.”
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I pray you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini is now missing after an aircraft crashed in a layer
The airline responsible for the plan that interfered in a lagoon in the Micronesia of the Pacific now says that a man is missing. Earlier, it was said that all 47 passengers and the crew had been discharged from the sinking planet and were in safety.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at the airport in the Chuuk Islands.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were left in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is unclear what caused the crash and how the incident occurred.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the planet landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing path.
Some witnesses believed that the planet was passing through the landing path.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"It's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to feed through mid-deep water to the emergency exits on the seventh planet.
He said the cabin staff were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor shell injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people in land before the planet sank in the 30 metre deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman is burned alive
The Prosecutor's side ended on Saturday's pledging in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi live in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the area of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had been using cell phone lists to reunite with 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers’ movements that night she died.
Rowlett said he had received localization data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers mobile phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked about Tellis, the truth said when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "welves, for my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis had a time after Chambers' death deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He threw her out of her life," Hale said.
The defence is scheduled to begin its final session on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol thinks the hip hop has come far away from its origins in political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a rise in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?!
A child girl in New York is a couple due to termination after a "racist" text message
A child girl in New York is a pair of discriminatory dismissals after she received a misdirected text message from modern, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racist and compare the mood with “expression”.
Two-child mom Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed horror when she understood that the new child girl Giselle Maurice was black, when she arrived at her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEJ NOT A SART INGEN," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a sms to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "little to courage," and gave Maurice fired, claiming that their former child girl, African American, had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in taxi.
Now she's right the couple to get compensation for the refusal. She requests compensation in the size scheme $350 per day for the job she was hired to do, which would last for six months and where she would stay with the couple. However, she had no contract.
“I want to show them that you don’t do that,” she told the New York Post on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple assumes the accusations that they would be racist and say that the only straight thing was to end Giselle Maurice's employment. They were worried that they could not trust her when they had offended her.
“My wife had sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not racist.
"We're not racist," said co-wife Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you had been uneasy about, even if it was a mistake?”
Your newborn baby?
Seriously speaking."
Plasco compared the mood with "expression" and said his wife would feed children two months later and be found in a "very difficult situation."
“Do you have to go to such a person?”
It's not very nice done," added the investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticizes them for their behavior and reasoning.
The Paddington papers did not believe that readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was assumed, commented: "It's hard to think about how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was released.
It’s very fun, considering what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterljuv" after his death last year.
She describes that Paddington was a "very important member of our family," allowing her father to be proud of her final success.
"He was pretty quiet, and not a bragging person," she said.
“But Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds with something. You’re proud of the child even if you’re not yourself who has accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a bit like that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give Paddington his own glory.”
My daughter was going to die, and I got to go well on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken into flight to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Now called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to get ready," Mr Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Since then, I received a call from Nad who said she was going to die within two minutes and that I have to take care of her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart at life slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was extinguished down.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn’t cry or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, landed on the plane along with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she was going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bent down my head, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Harder women put up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost close relatives because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to have to be as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells her son was a promising chef who had a contagious smile.
Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said that his smile was shining up the room.”
But he stopped working before he died, because he found himself "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling when he killed him in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I worry all the time for consequences."
Sharon Davis created the card "for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit silent, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, loses his partner since 15 years, Mark, a time after his mother's death.
"He had not said he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was different.
On Christmas Day, he found himself at the bottom. When the children opened their Christmas gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything.
She says his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to get through it.
It breaks us down.
But we have to fight all of them.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI initiates investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we might have little agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He allowed him to fear that the Committee would be "splitted" because of deeply rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their claim depends entirely on the time.
The mid-year elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the one they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called to senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personally secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would make the vice-president Mike Pence break the death sentence and confirm his election in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "sjunker" under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping off to South Korea has sunk since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which quotes data from South Korea’s Ministry of Re-organization, says 127 people jumped off last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that tougher border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher charges to human traffickers are important causes.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of North Korea’s defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fly via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily monitored demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korea states.
China sees the defections as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between North and South, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the fixed negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be released from the nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the U.S. sanctions for the lack of success since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we can absolutely not disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” said Ri at a UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric," saying he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The Minority Leader of the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said he was impermeable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help that I thought if a woman had behaved so, she would be called 'hysteric'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the accusations of sacrificing Dr Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally touched, and then he almost screamed and the voice grew when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, saying that the charges against him were a "grossed and coordinated character murder" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased to the disadvantages of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the couple Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she asked if she would try to ask Kavanaugh for impeachment if he is admitted, and if the Democrats receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this here - if he doesn't say the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not just inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he's on now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. appeal court.
Pelosi added that she as a Democrat was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh may take against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion target Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation requests, Kavanaugh questioned whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the location of a hysterical and biased person to sit in the court and expect us to all applaud,” said Pelosi.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous critique, months and years of anger that cooks over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said she was also crying when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she spoke to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger in part because they are often misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories of one of my first jobs at a mandominated office, where I once cried out of unwritten anger, was that I was taken in the collar of an older woman. It was a cool boss that I had always been a little scared of, and she went into a stairway house.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry and happy that they managed to push to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was appraised with an undisturbed deal on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason to investigate the idea of himself setting up in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well thought decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates, the last one they needed was one.
Someone called it “Snow and the Seven Devils.”
As she was late, she was left behind with the money collection, promising not to enter as a candidate if she didn't get together $2 million.
It was a project to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000,000 to men only gave her $250.
“Do you think I get a discount?” she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not start a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism, that the voice flourished.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder said in a statement.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, 'What are they going to write on my gravestone?'
“She cried?”
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The increase in trade war between the United States and China was far from over, but the crack between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning supplement earlier this year by imposing important Chinese export products such as solar panels, steel and aluminum with customs.
The most important escalation came this week, with new tariffs on goods for $200 billion. This means that in practice half of all goods coming into the US from China are nonsense.
Beijing has responded every time with the same coin. Recently, charges of between five and ten percent on US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US action. The second largest economy in the world will probably not step down within a foreseeable time.
Getting Washington to back means bending for demands, but public crypts for the United States would be too brilliant for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its short right, the press from the US trade war can give a positive support to China in the long run, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in the ends of the country, and it is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have previously well recognized," said Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria "redo" for homeless refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says the country is ready to receive voluntary return refugees and appeals for help in building up the country, which is in ruins after the seven-year war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now being improved.
"The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our successes in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeted at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian support.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe resigned victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won when Danish captain Thomas Bjørns team achieved the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought hard during the majority of the tournament, entered the water at the rash of the 16th hole's pair 3 track, and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was happiest in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made the 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth hit out 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest ranking players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranking player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spanjor Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25,5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win back the victory.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could help,” said a tube Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He left the relay stick to his countryman John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I'm excited to look at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
A remarkable statistics for one of the world’s best players ever, which has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the favor.
Hat of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the US PGA Tour and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be captain.
You'll have to bug and tap.
They played better than we did.”
Algbloming: Halter reduces in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida fishing and wild commission shows a general decrease in concentrations of algal bloom for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, uneven blooms are reported in the areas around the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier. This could indicate reduced levels.
The Algbloming stretches along just over 20 miles of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about one and a half miles into the sea outside Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algbloming has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Medium-high concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside Hillsborough's coast low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations at high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major communities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida that week.
