Breaking the World
Looks Like You Need Iceland, you’ve been well-known and excited and called out in nature are going to take people wide and wide around the world.
“My own collection, I need Iceland,” says a woman out there in the big world, commenting on the advertising of the Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube’s website.
Another prominent farewell will preserve Iceland in the heart of all eternity and a young woman will be able to reach the first to the end of Iceland.
However, in the United States, she is expected to have to wait for a few months.
One observer asks if the journey to Iceland is possible, because there are no planes.
Don’t follow the story if it comes out of a different time zone.
Egil Þórðrson, the advertising company Peel, who made the announcements along with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, said the receptions have been hopeful again.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland trips that have been very well, but this new campaign is already going to hit me.
It’s about creating PR values, it’s getting foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
For a relatively short time, we have received a survey of seven hundred media worldwide, which totals to nearly two billion people.
The value of the coverage is estimated at 1.8 billion kronor.
It's not amazing."
The main goal is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well, even though Americans are not on their way to the country soon.
According to Egils, known market areas such as Denmark, the UK and Germany have also welcomed themselves, such as Russia, which is easily surprised.
Then there was a reaction from the emerging regions, such as India, which had not been specifically addressed.
“These ads have traveled widely, but we lived,” says Egil, who could see more than four million people watching the YouTube content.
“We couldn’t have wanted a better start.”
The pictures here at the opening took Sæberg, the photographer Morgunblasins, at the recordings of ads carrying the inscription “Let It Out” in the middle of the last month.
The cookies were presented wide and wide, such as at the Skóla products trail in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjordur, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökull and in Helle Hjörlefjordur.
The captains were Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Paul Ólafsson at Skotti Productions, and were defeated by Ottar Gudnason.
In roles in the awards, the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, which are from Cuba and Hungary, were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas.
Tugir Íslandir came to make the announcements, but at the same time the recordings took place in southern Iceland were another group in the West and Westfjords.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland tour, but the aim is to winter tour in partnership with M&C Saatchi.
“It’s just the first phase of this work for Iceland office,” says Egil, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone very well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.”
Sprengisarður: The status of the labour market, pension fund and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðurson, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, meets in Sprengisand, which begins at 10 a.m.
He is also the Minister of Labour and holds the position on the labour market as such, Icelandair and other issues.
He also has been working on rural areas and transport in a country that has been poorly and has been in circulation for the past few years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, also attends the show, but he will discuss his criticisms about investments in pension funds and propose ideas for the work of a professional and a professional athlete to reduce the risk of interest rates.
In Iceland Ingimarsson, the travel agent in East Iceland, and Árnhei Jóhannsdóttir, director of the Marketing Centre of the Nordic Region, will discuss the status of tourism in the country’s rural areas.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a wild thing about what is going on.
Listen to the show below, but it starts at 10.
This is what she looks like today 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in the teenage races of any kind.
She played as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has happened to her in the past, but she got to look over the way and express herself on Cueles' television on the scenes.
She speaks beautiful about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built the personality of the girls I met in school that wasn’t good for me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was," Donovan said about his game in Clueless.
I didn’t want to leave the police station after night.
About fifty cases came on board the police in the capital area today, and the police said that the matter was varied.
The day at the police station at Hverfisgögur began by the police had to cancel a man who had been recently released from prison after having stayed there due to a drinking accident.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the instructions of the police who told him to leave.
The man has continued to stay at the police station because of his departure.
A man was arrested this morning, suspected of burglary in a company in Kópavogi.
The police also had to cancel two people in Brethrenholt due to a notification of body damage.
There was also the fact that a woman who sat in a shopping mall in Kópavogi could not pay for the account at the end of the meal and was called to the police.
It was also reported that the car was in the middle of the city this morning.
A white-white Renault ambassador looked at her for a moment, and she was taken free hand.
The car has not been found.
The Devil's Day - A powerful fate of the Glee stars
The theory has reached a flight on the Internet to curse the series about the Glees, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California on the hides and became the third main character to make life long before age.
The celebrations of the celebrations (e.g. Glee) are a popular show of singing, dancing and joy.
The people were passionate about the so-called Youth of the University of Education, their love and destiny.
It wasn’t always taken out with the soul to be in the festival, but through singing and dancing, the personality of the characters becomes able to overcome each of the situations that occurred in their lives.
But outside the scene, there has been a lot of disaster over the players and the staff of the participants, so very much that the teachings have woken up to curse the rest of the show.
Naya Marie Rivera took part in the role of Santönu Lopez in the show, a celebrator who didn’t call his entire grandmother.
After the show ended, Rivera joined Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for home violence against his husband and left them behind.
Dorsey refused to submit a plea and was the homewife’s case dropped.
On July 8th, the latter reported that Riveru was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found asleep in a rescue camp on board the boat and he could report the police authorities that he and his mother had sung him up and then Rivera had returned to the boat, but never returned there.
It's a huge search for Rivera.
The day after the search, the police chief told the area because we were looking out for Rivera to have drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was officially deposed.
It is said that she had landed in a large stream in the water, and a new hers to save her vision.
The crime scene was recorded by an accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith joined Finn Hudson in the episode, the American footballer with the angels' death, who played a key role in moving the Glees to the road and worth.
Without the elements, Moneith struggles with personal devils.
From the age of 13 he had been struggling with addiction and was trying to get away from it.
In 2013, his co-workers found themselves in the series enough to enter, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith went to treatment and seemed to be looking for better ways.
Just two months after his completion of treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after attending a concert with friends.
Banamein was found to be fatally mixed with drugs and alcohol.
I didn’t think about wanting to talk about it.
Moneith had been undergoing treatment and his stamina for vogues had reduced so much that the dose he had previously endured was proven fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his co-workers, but under his leadership, Lea Michele, was determined to keep the show going, and they dedicated the brain to the memory of Moneith and his personality.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and bore little respect for his colleagues in the Glejstjörður, or all until he left the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles suspected of child abuse.
At his home, he found a huge amount of child care and the issue quickly asked out in public.
It was clear that Salling had been there.
He was arrested and charged with his offence.
He overthrew his head four to seven years in prison, as well as the one he would have to be on a record of sex crimes and seek treatment for children.
Before the judge had determined the sentence, Salling, who was free from insurance, was killed near his home.
The murder was suicide.
It wasn’t just the players who fell far from the age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He died in his sleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
She also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was a younger sister of the star Julia Roberts and had her sister's not a professional story, but she sued Roberts for great control and unfavorable results.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her sister, where she asked her mother and sister, among other things, to be responsible for what happened to her.
“My mother and so-called siblings have nothing to do with me except the memory that it was the ones that kept my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her own uniform and passage to the scene and being with an overwhelming star rating.
Jesse Luken joined the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with a car accident in 2019, which included a lot of noise.
Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
It became clear in 2010 that an unexplored computer has been released on the Internet and published on the Internet.
Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the show and participated in the contest.
Benoist later said that Jenner had raped her.
You can put flowers on almost everything.
It increases the development of children when they get to play outdoors in a garden with the parents to grow flowers and to watch them grow and grow.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers like the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel suggests.
Just having time with the kids in the garden is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the perfume, and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
He took a boat after the tenth grade.
"I don't think we're a lot of sailors working at the school of the country," says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, who runs a coastal road in the summer but lives in psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter season.
The beach is a very comfortable summer vacation when you are in school.
If you choose to fish, you can have good income and I feel great to be able to let go of taking a class.
The teas also bring me well into the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, 25-year-old psychologist, who spends the summer as a summer holiday.
Axel was recently brewing on Tjalkjörður when a journalist got a speech from him late at night at the beginning of the week.
“The one I was in the tenth grade, I took the ship rights for boats under 12 meters long and I bought my boat the summer after finishing the primary school.
I’ve been fishing on my boat a few years ago.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmanni Jónssyn, and I gave the boat his name.
Hartmann was grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very happy when he saw the boat carrying his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat in three million.
“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer, but the other half at the end of summer when I was fishing.
I had the boat in the end of my first summer.”
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had a new elementary school?
“I’ve been preparing and collecting money, I’ve been working with my dad for sea when I was a boy, I was all a lot to hunt with him and got my share.
I also put my suitcases in my boat.”
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, from where all his mother is, but he has lived in Cópavogur since he was a boy.
“I can hunt here in the western region because I have a legal home with my grandmother in Iceland.
I learned in this area from my dad’s west.
I'm moving between the distances to how I feel, because this fishing area is close to all the Westfjords.
Even though I find it best to be for the West, I have also provided around the Snæfellsnes and beyond.
I have also provided for the sun but the most important grey drop," says Axel, who always speaks one fire in the morning and sometimes speaks to the moon and sings to the sky, in the outer spheres together on the ballstand.
“The connection to the outside is good, so I can call, listen to the video shows and music.
I don’t think there’s anything to be alone in a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid landing in high, but certainly have some unique times something to be weathered, but never a lot of danger," says Axel, who is lucky with the fact that he is never a pirate.
He says the length of the day depends on how the road runs.
“In the beach, I’m never more than 14 hours on a road, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the camp, but then I’ve been together for one and a half hours on the sea fishing.”
He said he was going to be fishing 770 pounds a day, which he thinks he's in a state of trouble.
“The autumn months are they that I can’t hunt Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and I can only hunt twelve days a month, this four months as a beach road crossing over, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their hunting day after the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is for men to calm instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose from their head.
So the area partition could go my way too, and the seabed that is well located with the fish industry should enjoy it," says Axel, who draws the most omega from the sea on its shores, but also only theufs and unique other species of fast with.
Axel works over the winter season with the college at Núpi, Kópavogi.
“I don’t think we’re a lot of sailors working at the university,” says Axel proudly, adding that he’s only meant to work temporarily at the school.
“I’m stuck because I think it’s a great job.
“I hope that the psychology teaches me in the future,” says Axel, who is also far from studying in business science.
Error in registration prevents home spam
An error in the registration paper that people fill out when it comes to the country became a person, living here on land, was not called again in a show.
The registration number is not required if the relevant fills the form in English, as is when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be seen in the week,” said a specialist at a medical clinic.
A third of the country’s population was identified in the Landspital Department yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules on the so-called home issue took effect.
Those who lived in Iceland are then skid to the country and returned to show four to five days later.
In the afternoon, we decided that the same person would have gone after the old system.
The status of the border was negative, and he was not called back in a skim for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in the field of veterinary medicine, said in an interview with a news agency that this could be attributed to an error in the electronic registration paper.
Filling people out the registration form in English is not the condition to set the index numbers as is in the Icelandic version.
It was first and foremost thought for foreign tourists.
Therefore, they did not receive an automatic invitation to show.
Kamilla says many, though, have followed the rules of home affairs if they have filled the registration form in English and in some cases, employers have also been alert to send people back to the country after it came to the country.
“This will be seen in the week how it can be easier for people to get their attention to the process.”
The man is in isolation and six have been arrested.
They all went to the show, but two were beginning to show signs.
Smiling is now underway with the three infections that were detected yesterday, but it is largely completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there is a variation of the coronavirus that has not been found here before.
In another case, Israel has been told that the person who moved the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be here tomorrow when the other boat was coming.
There are currently 15 in isolation according to COVID. is.
There are 135 in attendance.
Four out of five infections undisclosed
Five countries have been in the country for the past few days.
Of these, four alphas are unrestricted and are not created to detect the source of the infection that came up with the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday.
Simplicity is still overwhelming.
Originally, the third one was sent to a local hospital, but they were dropped to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 cases of these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is for the second time in a short period of time that is infected with a sport event and has an amazing question of whether or not such an event should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, Managing Director of the Public Police Department, says it well possible, as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
“We are constantly pressing for all those who live here that it needs to be kept up to the individual infection.
We also need to ask people who are concerned that there are certain rules in progress that need to be left behind.
“It’s possible to keep an event,” says Jóhann.
He says it is possible to prevent infection by keeping in the air of an individual infection.
Rules and criteria are also available in a continuous review.
“What needs to be done, and what the public sector and the medical profession are constantly pressing to people, is to keep in mind that this individual-bound infection.
Both at home and also for service companies.
People wash their hands and use alcohol.
“It’s a good way to get infected,” says Jóhann.
“We need to make it clear to people to continue on the good road we were on, to keep up the results we have achieved.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard of her phone how hard her father had to catch the breath.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical care.
The next day he was dead.
The disease was caused by sudden difficulty in breathing due to coronavirus infections.
Diabetes mellitus was indicated in the adulthood as underlying problems and is Brumfield, also with diabetes, afraid not to go for it.
Reuters reporters say fear of Brumfield is not a reason.
A recent study by the U.S. government shows that 40% of those who have been diagnosed with diabetes 2 as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who did not reach the age of 65 has been evaluated, the ratio is up to half.
A study by the U.S. Department of Defense (CDC) took more than 10,000 people in 15 states that were killed from the coronavirus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases in the CDC, says the results are striking, not what is the least for those who have diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
The decline in the slow growth of Reuters allowed surveying and points the answers from the 12 rich who responded to comparable rates.
10 states, but among them are California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet reported from underlying diseases.
“Immigrants were already at a slow rate.
Now COVID -19 has been violated as a powerful age," Reuters, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University, said.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, which has also gone out of the colony virus.
One of the best products for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in spoons with physical fitness, healthy diet and health care professionals.
However, the coronavirus epidemic has made a lot of effort to keep the red.
In addition, insulin has a high level of toxicity to continue to appear in the work and to stop it from being exposed to the virus.
Reuters suggests that the U.S. government could be aware of the dangers that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
If the SARS coroner passed over in 2003, over 20% of those with the disease and in the swine fever age in 2009, this group was at three times more likely to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, a study showed that 60% of those who were killed or were hospitalized were with diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a researcher at Yale University, said that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could no longer be seen, the danger has attracted a large number of previously unknown complications.
“I fear we’ll see a complicated problem when it’s over,” said Andrew Bolton of the International Federation of Sugar Nurses.
Doctors have warned that the coronovirus virus virus virus epidemic could result in an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney diseases and kidney conditions.
As a direct new study, the coroner could lead to the proliferation of diabetes cases.
Reuters says researchers are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus is caused by the heart, lungs and kidneys, the organs that are already weak in many people who have diabetes.
Thus, the high percentage of glucose and lipids in sugars may induce a real-time “cell attack” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Infectious epithelial cells can also lead to inflammatory formation that may in turn cause fatal blood clots.
"It's all a big puzzle game," said Dela Cruz.
“It’s related to everything.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were invited to fight, so they went out of the room.”
Ásúsnún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason became the unusual character from the artist Ragnar Kjartan Kjartansssyn to pursue sex in front of a camera in front of a work that the artist was set up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and granddaughter, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
“I was very impressed by her.
It was natural, but it also seemed to me very well.
And still," he said.
This is also the first meeting of the owner on a regular basis.
“I’m always hearing this story.
“Last weekend,” she said, who also told her husband about her first appearance.
“I found and felt so much effort around Atla, which I liked.
There’s a lot going on and a lot of things happen, and I’m very excited about it.”
They say they have focused on it in their relationship to go their own ways.
“We don’t tie our backs with the same knots as co-workers.
"We're going to start a routine that we're talking about."
It is possible that they took the emancipation from Ragnari Kjartansyníður photographers only celebrate, though it would be mildly unusual.
“Kristin Anna’s joint friend has contact with us and asks if we can eat deserted with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg’s wife Ragnars, on Snaps.”
They invited, hit the trio on Snaps, and got deserted wine and their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his work on the art show which he thought was set up in Palais de Tokyo in the autumn.
“He had a series of video works called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Ásrún says that he described the work as a bane and deported from everyday life in the West.
“He had a sketch of all the late ones he wanted to shoot and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we wanted to participate.”
The latter, as Ragnar asked the couple to participate, was to show young middle class couples to love in a minimalist room.
“It’s the same with the beginning and the end,” says Atli.
The couple didn’t know much about Ragnar, though they knew him and he of them, but they knew us and found us fit.
They had a word because they didn’t want to advertise to people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn’t get the right people, but people who got sexual benefits from performing for others.”
They started thinking about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we went out of Snaps, we said, ‘Are we not just going to do this?’
It was just that way.
“I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his team,” says Ásrún and Atli.
“It’s about love and the neighbor.”
The restaurant was set up in a nice apartment on the Mýra Street.
There was a very small film studio; taken, Ragnar and the singer and the couple.
After the launch, all the rooms had to wait outside the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“We didn’t decide how we should be.
We had some instructions, but we tried to forget some time and place.
Be aware of what we were doing and for whom.
“It wasn’t the game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” he said.
Was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a romantic,” says Atli and Ásrún agree.
“We were invited to battle before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on a holiday in a nice hotel in Paris.”
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved with them.
“When Tommi took a look at this, he cried, although it was so beautiful,” says Atli.
“It’s just as much about love as the neighbor and the self-sacrifice,” says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and say that his mother heard the voice in the vision at the Reykjavík Art Museum and realized that he was part of the work.
“She’s going to go and play it,” says Atli.
My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone that way, but so just sent my dad a message and said: “It’s nice to get back to the little family in Palais de Tokyo.”
And will the show have been in contact with Ásúr and Atla?
“We’re still together so maybe that’s something.
This was my connection to the family," says Ásrún and laughs.
He himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I felt a bit difficult not to be with you, but to someone else,” she says and turns to her husband.
“But it was fun to see this because it’s just one late in a much bigger work and when you saw this with the other effects, it’s really great.
I had a little bit of it and I was just proud.
And there was a small bite in my stomach,” says Ásrún, who was pregnant by the other children’s wives when the sun was taken.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atla in the novels of Rás 1.
Swansea with a win in the previous Olympics
Swansea won a 1-0 win at Brentford in a drama game.
This was the first game of the team in the final round of the game to get into the English Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea, Wales.
The score in half was 0-0.
The men of Swansea received a 64-minute vote, while Andre Ayew failed to remove the book by the courtroom and allowed them to defend.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, actor Brentford, received the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game a man fewer and in the 82nd minute new players Swansea play the team.
Andre Ayew then added the turquoise by scoring a great mark and securing Swansea 1-0 win.
Swansea leads the 1-0 in the stadium, but the second game will take place on Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Foreign Minister for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted to get a weaponsed bodyguard where he feared about his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to ship the ambassador to this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the U.S. Embassy in April 2009, it has been officially sent to the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst made a statement of special circumstances, but Kastsögst reported in 2009 that she had to get the Fálkaksa.
On the way to a meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office that she would not be able to speak the word.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Six months after Van Voorst's arrival in September 2010.
In some ways, Robert S. Connan was appointed as the ambassador, but so did.
At the end of his career, Loius Ariega had worked in the Foreign Service for decades.
He left office in the autumn of 2013 and took office as ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we took another foreign time.
Robert Barber received approval in January 2015 and came to work shortly later, but no ambassador had been in place for 13 months.
Barber was a political officer, but not a diplomat, but he had been serving as a lawyer and a short co-chairman of Baracks Obama.
He resigned as President Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as a friend with a political ambassador.
Trump was not allowed to ship both the ambassador and the government of Washington.
For two years until the U.S. Congress announced Jeffrey Ross Gunter's meeting to ask him the spears from and confirm that the end of the ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony to the Senate, he said he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who has died, had been of the Dutch mountain broken.
Gunter is a political director, previously a dentist in California, and has been prominent in the organization of the Jewish Coalition.
Sheldon Adelson founded the team, but Adelson is a supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been on the country since the early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example of the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s administration was to appoint people in key terms, and that in recent years the U.S. Congress has been very successful in the long run, including confirming the ambassador to the office.
Since 2009, it has been a total of five years in Iceland.
However, this has not prevented the implementation of the embassy, which opened the new headquarters of the Ensemble.
The outputs are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the safety walls cover the building and the shot-held glass are in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador’s security because it is said to be afraid of his life and has sought to get the weapons of life.
Former Irish player IBV became a racist in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, the former player of IBV, said he had become a racist when he was in Iceland and that he was looking for him to come to the country.
This is an interview with Tonny, who appeared in the Spanish midday Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team as a game in the top division of Uganda.
In his interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talked about many things, including his time here in the country, but he played with IBV, Val and Tóttir in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I was used to play.
The team was in that position, but in addition, he was also with the three-digit number that I wanted to have so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny, but he played on the right side of the season with IBV.
One of the things that Tonny kidnapped is racism that he was doing in Iceland.
He says it’s a problem that many black players are going to play in Europe.
“It once came to me, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just hated what was said to me.
Later I heard about the case, and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He told me that my opponent had let me go of a rage after I touched him.”
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He said he made the mistakes he saw most of the time.
Tonny had not been able to get to the starting team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to return to Iceland on his loan, but he went to Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland.
I think if I had been longer in Norway, I would have had the chance I wanted to get,” says Tonny, but he was hoping that if he would play well in Norway he would probably go further.
He says that the loan to Iceland has made out of his dreams of getting into the big city of Europe.
Meeting a worm in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 cm long black worm in a necklace woman who was looking for.
Doctors were able to pull out the heat with a tunnel.
A study found that the parasites were talking about.
CNN reports this.
The woman had a few days before eating sashimi, which is the third of the meat.
The woman quickly recovered after the worm was removed but the parasites on board these are often in raw meat or fish.
After Sushi was deployed to bed in the West has cases, where parasites have been living in people, the number of people reported to CNN.
It’s hard to say that another city is starting in Europe.
Spain is now in a focal point in the context of concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus virus in Europe, but there has been an action to restore the coronavirus epidemic to the new one.
In Catalonia, everything has been spent on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barceló where infections are growing.
Other European countries have also taken action for the proliferation of infections in Spain, but in the UK, everyone needs to go to the arrivals of Spain, like in Norway, and the French have been warned of travel to Spain.
Smitum is also growing again in France and Germany, where the government tries to find a balance in the recovery of the virus and bring the economy back.
However, Europe’s population is good compared to elsewhere in the world, but new infections in the world reach over 300 thousand a day, while most of them are infected in America and South Asia.
There are 16 million people worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, and there are deaths that are confirmed to be associated with the virus by 644 thousand.
Mosques are finally able to enjoy them for the most part.
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
There are men with an orange helmet.
There is also a large graph.
And more work engines.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the gangs are able and there are many who are now stalking and respecting art from millions of mosaics —as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least not knowing it.
The work has been quite hidden, just in front of the parking lot that was always the case.
People lay there, locked the car in the snare, and then jumped out of their minds in the middle of the city.
“A vibrant and diverse public space” and “additional urban buildings” are a guide to the restoration of the safety tower that is now over.
The goal is to make a beautiful area and allow the mosaic works Gerður Helgadóttir on the Toll House to enjoy the show better.
The future of the project will be square and where the area is well situated at the sun, it is considered suitable as a residence area for road passengers.
The artwork will be described and will be able to enjoy it better than before on these 142 square meters.
In the area there will also be small “kids,” some kinds of water-clamps, which offer a game and provide the area with a specific spray.
In this way, the renovations are described by Reykjavík City, which is to be carried out together with Vedi.
Laws of water, heat and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their age, but the school and cold water law are from the year 1925, and have served as residents and businesses in the middle of the century.
When the street is reopened, cars can drive around again.
However, it will become a one-party street, and as soon as it becomes a quiet and accessible space for pedestrians.
In the fraternity of the Customs House on the website of the Customs Governor, the house was used in 1971, but its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Due to the fact that the porter was able to reach through the house, 250 square meters of windowless wall walls were filmed out to the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a flood would have a bad impact on the overall film, if no special measures were taken to make the house’s appearance.
The parties agreed to calculate by setting up a permanent work of art.
At this time, a lot of words from Gerdi Helgadóttir, the artist, went on to say in the summary.
She has worked a lot in Germany and abroad.
The decision was to contact her first before deciding whether or not to compete for the work.
Often it had been said that the work had to mirror the life of the port, but the author had been the life of Reykjavík since she was made.
When she was talking to the artist, she had to take the grip of such a work.
It was agreed that she would be given drawings and other assistance before returning to the country of crime, where she would work with the laws abroad.
She had the time she decided to have herself, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for a discussion.
It was not possible to ask her to do the work.
In addition, it was sought to make a total agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerd had long worked with them for the installation of famous artworks across Europe.
The compositions were taken and Gerðr won the artwork under the installation of their brothers, who then saw the installation of the Toll House.
All the work was very well done, both by half Gerður Helgadóttir and Oidtmannbrørra, says in the summary.
Since then, it has been a very difficult time for Icelandic fans.
It took about two years to work, which was won and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Toll House was completed, just 47 years old.
In order to move more institutions out of the country
The Minister of Social Affairs announces that more public institutions will be transferred to the country in the next few years.
This was said by the Minister in the episode Sprengisandur at the lunchtime.
Recently, it was reported that a browning field of Housing and Human Resources will be transferred to the North Sea in the autumn.
Six experts in the field of arsonism work with the agency, but none of them intends to follow the agency north and has the Lands connection of firearms and ambulances.
“I think we’re going to step further in this world.
I am preparing for further steps in this world.
“Fearly moving,” said Ásmundur.
He is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think it needs to take further political decisions on the transfer of public works into a country, like I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Agency,” said Ásmundur, but he also took an example of other institutions that have been transferred to a country and changed much importance to communities outside of the country, such as transportation of food to Selfosss, Landskrift Iceland’s Lands Lands Lands Insurance Authority to Akræðurðurðurðurðurðurðurður and Skaðurðurðurðurðurður’skríðurðurðurðurður.
Everything from the second day of the Champions League
94. The Champions League of Iceland in free sports ended at Þórsvík in Akureyri today.
Some of the tournaments were on the second day of the race.
Reykjavík had an exciting competition for women at Thorsvík, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir of FH set the ice cream in the district in 2014, which lasted until Elishabet Rutnardóttir of the IR was added in May.
Vigdís won the ice cream back in the summer and has been in the fantasy form up to the end, but she has tripled what is summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been struggling with injuries and was unable to reach a line today.
She had only one pitch of five, threw 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 metres in her last attempt and set the course of the mold.
The ice cream she set until July is 62.69 meters, and she was quite different from that.
Guðrún Karites Hallgrímsdóttir of IR had the next cast of the day, but she improved her best performance with casts of up to 50.18 metres.
In the men's team, the FH team won Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Íslandsmethafen in the smelter, safe but he threw 73.84 metres in his last cast and placed the mold.
The ice field in this article is 75,26 meters.
Gudni Valur Gudnason, the Olympian and the Icelandic Meteorist, won a competition in the club at Thorsvík yesterday, but today he competed in the broadcast which is his main branch.
The Icelandic Gudna Vals is 65.53 meters but he threw the longest 59.13 metres today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second-placed cast today, while he had a pitch of 2nd place, 49.43 metres.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland’s national team in a long-range, won the long-running competition with events, but Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 metres today, which is roughly 40 cm from her Icelandic saturation.
In the 200 metre race of women, it was the IR-inger Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was a bouncer, but she came to the ground in 24.04 seconds, while her ice cream in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Gudbjjörg Jóna was a successful winner of Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in a 100 metre race and in 4 x 100 metre race, and also in 4 x 400 metre gift race today.
In the men's class, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson was the first in the field at 200 metres in the race at 21,57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samuelsson from Ármann.
Like Gudbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höða won gold in 100 metres yesterday as well as 400 metres in the race.
Don't get a fine for 27 million kronor Bitcoin stores
The Tax Committee has denied the claim of a tax examiner who claimed a fine over a man to overwhelm his financial assets that were due to the sale of Bitcoin.
The Board finds that the tax investigation officer had not been able to explain why it was necessary to sect the man.
According to the committee’s report, the tax examiner considered the man to be a materially wrong tax issue due to the 2016 and 2017.
He would have used his financial assets to come because of the sale of Bitcoin’s electricity up to 27 million, either misleading or of a magnificent shepherd’s weakness.
Take the poor man for his own sake.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
He went on to sell a coin for $27 million in 2016.
He would have had a great success in 2009 and 2010 when it had been both easy and expensive with a normal home injury.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electronics, he would have taxed due to such sales being significant inefficacious and unpredictable.
It would have been possible for the public to make such a decision on tax.
He did not intend to pay taxes on the harvest and would have made an opinion on his own in the presentation as an indemnity of the currency account.
He would have asked for both the teachers and the governor for how this would be done, but without success.
He believed that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began to dig in Bitcoin.
He would have been in a worse position than others to introduce complex rules that the tax authorities had not made clear consideration.
The man considered that his tax for these two years would be revised and applied, but otherwise not a penalty.
He said he would have paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He had never intended to escape his guilt in an unfavorable manner.
The sect was out of everything and would cast him in debt.
“This man understands what football is.”
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been widely discussed between the people of the people, but he also enjoyed a passion for his performance as a player with Breibenablik in Pepsi Max.
Blitter will be in the fire line tonight when they receive the IA on the forward broadcast at Stage 2 Sport.
Brysjólf then takes out a game ban due to four memories of the game and therefore does not come to play with a new clip like in the games of the summer.
He had written “bla, bla, bla” on the line for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“I don’t know what exactly he was answering with the payment, but talking about the character was better than trying in the game.
He did not go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time, and if there was someone going to equal this game then I thought he would do it or make it," said Gudmundur Benediktsson in Pepsi Max.
“I have to be here for the people.”
“It’s hard sometimes to figure out what position he is.
“He’s looking a bit out on the left when it’s going to feel the game, but he has a very free roll in the team,” said Hjörvar Hafnardason.
Thorkell Máni Petersson says Brynjólf real amusement power and celebrates getting such a colorful man in the department: “No one knows that this is a character.
This is a fun sweater and I love this with my hair, and always be ready to meet and respond in interviews.
There are a lot of people who are busy with him who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“I am a fun worker.
I have to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interview with Brynjólf, people are paying in and watching what’s next on their hair.
“This man is just a genius,” said Máni.
"I've been in contact with some teams in the B-team."
Tobias Thomsen, player KR in Pepsi Max division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to Danish midfielder Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the issue.
Tobias wants to reach the start of the period in his home country, but he must first terminate his contract with KR where the Danish division begins before the Icelandic probability.
The company knows that I miss Danmark and have shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with some teams in the B division and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay up my contract with KR.”
He says that he needs all kinds of money to be paid in Denmark.
“Fears in Denmark have probably found more for the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bjartmar has recovered bikes for millions - Answers now after the DV review
For years, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest in most others.
He ran up and rescued the lost and stolen bicycles, bicycles and scooters.
Bjartmar has the name of the “wheeler” for the tire.
Last night, there was a talk of excitement when a man published a statement of his relationship with Bjartmar.
DV then discussed Facebook’s group of Westerners, where Bjartmar took the man on a speech at the East Coast and said the wallet could be stolen.
There was no other way to read from the original writing of the electrician, but that Bjartmar had stolen him.
The text has now been changed to Facebook and the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original news of the case at least did not describe what really happened yesterday at the East Coast.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victims of electronics that this was truly his electronics.
The information received was intended by the owner of others, but the information was tried wrongly, says Bjartmar.
“I looked to the street and I was able to go to the warehouse, yet with information that there was an electrician who had been missing for a very long time and was looking for it.
I certainly laughed first, but when I saw him living under a drive of the closet, I decided to cry to the man.
The owner was certain in his search and I decided to talk to the man.
In general, I am going very well in such a matter, but before I finally finished what I had to say, the man had taken off my word.”
Bjartmar says that the man in the electrician had invited him to show him the receipt for the wheel and himself called the police.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "if it's just clean."
Then the owner of the electronics company gave the ownership of his electronics and refused to go.
Later, the right owner of the electronics magazine told her story on Facebook, similar to that reported in the previous news.
In this year’s space that Bjartmar has spent some time at his level, he can count on the time he raised on other people’s faces.
“I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavík,” said Bjartmar, indicating that bicycles are long-suffering to the least brothers and sisters of society, pigs, crazy people and other people who are part of the street.
“The economy is a hard housing provider and some people need to finance the next dose, unfortunately, the thief is in such an easy way to achieve that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationship with these people is so good that I have a lot of good people with me.
Some people have been treated and treated and looked for me and helped me with what I am doing," he said.
In general, the communication of Bjartmar with bicycles is generally a matter of course.
Some people know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him the receipts, the number of bicycles and so on.
The motor vehicle is a big problem that has not been discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says the police are more likely to tell people to talk to him out of the stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is unhappy with the previous DV news transmission and says that it is not a one-person self-designed police officer in a personal search for justice.
If he is not at the top of the ice, and whether this is not the first and foremost role of police, Bjartmar says so certainly.
"The fact is that the police are not doing this, but the fact is that the police are not doing this.
I've been looking at police officers driving away from a big crash of stolen wheels.
She's clean-hearted in these matters."
“When the police are not doing anything about it, and this is just in front of the nose of you, and the experience has shown that I can achieve success in this category, why not?”
He says he has achieved so much success in having up on the chair wheels, that sometimes he is riding on his “slide” on the street that they just had the right Bjartmari bikes they had previously reached.
The changes that Bjartmar has called after the help police have made clear that she is not going to be there.
“It’s not just working with the police, and it’s not me to teach and it’s not the owners of the bicycles to teach,” Bjartmar said, and it’s sorry that victims of motorcycles need to feel incarcerated in this case.
The success of Bjartmars is not shared.
We can find the stories of people thanking Bjartmari for having their own ones back.
Bjartmar has long lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts run by millions, if not millions.
Roads where electric scooters, electric motors and electric scooters are heavy, but electric wheels can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works on the day of the school and every other weekend he works in a community.
His bike job is therefore an award he has won in his spare time.
Long and Long Shadows
In 2019, there was a great anniversary in the history of Iceland.
Officials had been awarded a retirement from Dana king of all the streets of the 19th century, but in 1919, a pension fund was established by officials who eventually became the pension fund of all public employees.
The basis for the current pension fund since then was created by the General Assembly on the labour market in 1969, where the claim for a job-related pension fund with a mandated and a full-fledged fund from the 1970s.
In 1974, a law was put on the basis of these agreements and the pension scheme continued to deteriorate after that.
Life insurance workers were not the only radical change that worked for the 20th century.
In 1955, unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar manner in historical cases, and the organization gradually gained its demands on the right of sickness and health, significant unemployment, the short term of work, the care of housing and much more as a whole.
All these rights cost a great and tough fight, but they tried, after having to think, much more and more powerful than the increase in the number of auras in the wage strike, which disappeared equally in the nineteenth century as a unique period of war and until 1990 as many monks.
The aim of the establishment of a general pension fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
While men would eventually come together to realize that the funds would be in fact owned by the social partners, the workers’ movement would fall to the extent that their governments were required to appoint a full-fledged employer and social partners equally.
In the next few years after the establishment of the Board of Directors, the majority of the members of the Board of Directors often came to debate in the organizations of wages, but she never realised to go, and therefore we still stand up with the abnormal arrangement that representatives of the Board of Directors are not in the majority of the Boards.
Article 36 of the Act No 129/1997 on the Liability of Pension Rights and the activities of pension funds are discussed on the Financial Policy of the Funds.
It says in the 1st paragraph that “the pension fund must have the interests of the social partners to guide.”
It also says in the 5th paragraph: “Life insurance should set a moral interest in investments.”
For the purpose of the Life Savings Trade Agreement, among other things, the following provisions include:
The National Pension Fund is a party to the rules of the United Nations (UN PRI) on responsible investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the West Sea and Europe.
The rules discuss how environmental and social issues and good governance companies can contribute to improving investment opportunities.
This will bring together the interests of investors and the goal of the social community in a broader context.
LV believes that companies, in particular those listed on the stock market, have an official policy on: to promote good governance of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The pension fund is valid, which is with the largest sea level of the country, has set itself “a policy on responsible investment” and there are provisions of similar trains.
It’s all set up here as an entrance to the latest fashion trend of the Icelandic, “sugging.”
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hope that it has been defined as the guitar, but I now see the following definition being “most taken”: the control is when the leader of the unions says in the media that he is going to send the representatives of the company in the management of the pension fund or the instructions on how to take action into account.
If they do not comply, they will be expelled from the administration for the first time.
If the leader doesn’t go with this in the media and doesn’t talk about the story, however, it’s not “the government” that’s the same communication between people of course all in the financial world as elsewhere.
I’ll let the reader think about how the way he feels “greary.”
In particular, there are two men who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are the editor of the Newspaper and Ásgeir Jónsson.
The proposal for both was made after Bogi Nils Bogason, Chairman of Icelandair, had said from his intention to cut off the contracts of the company with aviation and air servers (see them up), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Icelandic Society of Iceland, sent them a statement to the representative of the company in the management of the pension fund, not to be supported by the shareholders of the company.
A few years later, Bogi Nils made his decision back and after that, Ragnar Þór went the same way with his recommendation, which was of course based on the decision of Boga.
Nevertheless, they saw Hörður and Ásgeir a reason to discuss the issue in the Friday newspaper, with great words about shadow management, law violations and rich need for changes to the law.
There was a little bit you really had to choose a heavy load although the diaper you had been in connection with and also was wiped out quickly.
Since this is important, let’s consider the content itself at the end.
I’m going to go ahead of those items in the law on the pension fund that we’re talking about in this regard.
In those cases, the Board of Directors must take care of the interests of the social partners and have a moral interest in investment, and this item is further clarified in the agreed terms of both the value and the pension funds as I mentioned.
However, life insurance companies are not allowed to look only for short term investment in their investments.
This would be a serious policy and does not have to look for long-term examples of such things in the past, as large deposits of banks and oceans have run to unsolicited adventurers and environmentalists, with audible consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on high ice when he thought to wipe out a whole group of employees, thus greatly reducing the wealth that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
He looked at it and pulled it back.
The time has come to light whether it is possible for the investment of pension funds in the company to be held accountable to the fundraisers when the place is up.
Author is a former professor of physics and science.
One of them didn’t have a home affair.
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic states on 15 July last year, about a week and a half ago.
He is a foreigner who is not a resident of Iceland, however, and therefore did not receive clear instructions on meeting the so-called home issue after the arrival of the country and going to another show a few days after the arrival.
He had a negative impact on the border.
“But he’s in the Icelandic community and in fact going into that situation,” said Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist at the Landskrit and a local doctor while in summer, in conversation with the Newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the registration number, and if the registration number is not registered, you are not automatically announced in the later exhibition.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually a resident abroad, but because of his relationship with the country that Icelanders would have preferred to use it in Icelandic.
He did not agree with this.
“When the certificate is not registered, you need to apply for it yourself in the second screening.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have understood that it was the right way," Kamilla said.
“It is clear that we need to promote information about this while we find some way to make an automated preaching system even if Icelanders do not register their data.
Or, somehow, making it more obvious who are the participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system,” she explains.
It is better to get to the country, even though it is defined as a part of the Icelandic community, to remain Iceland’s host.
Only six people have been sent to the hospital since he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all together with him.
However, they have to go to the show, but two of them have been shown to show the signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative opinion from his show at the border on July 15th.
Kamilla is likely to have been recently infected by the virus that she has not yet been able to identify him when the show was taken to the border.
However, she does not want to exclude the man from being infected here in Iceland, but does not carry the virus to the country.
“It’s not quite possible to assume that this is probably infectious because it’s long since he came to the country that he might have been posted here as these two who have caused a little crash in connection with the sport.”
It says that it is very unlikely because of how few people are aware of it.
“It’s really very different,” Kamilla says, but it’s not possible to exclude it until the Icelandic genetic analysis has been conducted on the branch of the human virus.
“If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost safe that he’s brought it to the country.”
Piparspreyi and bombarded against protesters
The police and protesters came to Seattle last night.
Police tried to protest pipe-scrorey and inexplicably hand blasts, but protested the bridge and turned into.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were wounded.
Police and racial discrimination were protested in the United States last night, but the protest in Seattle was supported by protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
After the incident on the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of people gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then turned into a building area and bridged the city’s courthouse.
According to the police, the protests were uninjured and were taken between groups of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, was at least one of the protesters.
A car ran through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of people came together and fought justice for Breonnu Taylor, 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at his home in March last year.
The group was carrying a firearm, and went to the camps to close street clashes, where police accused the group of a group of people protesting the protests and also carrying a gun.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, 22-year-old black man who was murdered by white barbie in May.
Solsjær: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, footballer Manchester United, doesn’t want to do too much of the important game at Leicester today in the final election of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, the sole Solskjær and his men in the 5th place and lose there by the Champions League.
However, they should still hope to get to the Champions League by winning the European Union next month.
“We are not in the end.
"If we reach out to Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad time," Solskjær said.
“But whatever happens, this isn’t the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land by reaching the two teams above us,” Solskjær said.
It is apparent that the nerves of humans will be silent at 15 a.m. today, but Solsjær tried to pretend that about each other the game was about to be discussed.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
It’s nothing new, and it’s based on the company.
"We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it's ours to use it," Solskjær said.
“It’s not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone who is in football, the next game is always the most important.
“The outcome does not define our period, we have already had many moments to define this period.”
“Come Bruno Fernandes changed much for us and I believe that we are in a better form and will be stronger spiritually than in the last period,” Solsjær said.
65,000 infections of sunburn
65,490 new infection of the coronavirus virus was detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4.178.021 infections have been confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic in the country.
900 people died from the virus last night, but the last four days showed that there were more than 1,000 deaths per day.

According to the U.S. Supreme Court, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 on August 15th.
Fear of another wave of the disease
The government of Spain is now trying to recover from the increase in COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There are no more branches in one day from the beginning of May, and the ferries at the same time as the Spanish began to delineate one of the most steep terrains in Europe.
The attack led to the British authorities blaming passengers who come from Spain to attend the visit.
In the past, Spain was on the list of Britain’s safe states.
The situation is what is the worst in Catalonia in the north-east of Spain, since the government has seized a wider limit to attempting to stem the growth.
In the capital of Barcelona, entertainment places will be closed for the next two weeks and medieval houses will be closed at midnight.
It is now estimated that more than 200 thousand people in the province of Segria are now living in the western part of Catalonia.
It is said that the decision Breta will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which angers a lot on the arrival of foreign tourists and is a bad game after the danger.
Tui, the largest travel agency in the United Kingdom, cancelled all flights scheduled today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
The government around the world is slated to prepare for the later wave of the epidemic, but a small interest seems to be taking over again to the extent of a massive ban that has severely destroyed the economy.
In order to form, Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken very ill in such a way as to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Jean Castex, the Prime Minister of France, said that the nation “do not get life off, economic or social,” if it would again be taken into exile on a national scale.
Many of the leaders of the local economy who reach the population of a unique town, pay or land will be able to keep the virus back in the next round if it comes.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three in Iceland
In the last three weeks, a third of the population was reported as well as two additional countries.
So, five people with positive Covid-19 infected last night in Iceland.
The report states that one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to prison and sixteen people who were in close contact with him.
The infected person was a member of the association’s sports association in Reykjavík and is according to the announcement, “Only part of the sport” in the event.
Others who were sent to the hospital relate to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and infectious infection in the full run by the FBI.
ReyCUP has been followed by the instructions and regulations of the medical professional and the staff who are still in force and have appropriate measures been made.
While growing pictures of the yesterday’s attention, seeing the power of a very close collaboration to celebrate its good course on the streets.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the fans announced the following announcement on their Facebook page.
“ATH: Parents kindly respect the rules for the contestants to attend their own school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection reported last year.
According to the statement: “The Icelandic genetic analysis has reported the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified here before.”
It is also illegal to detect infection and is infected in isolation and 12 in the infection due to the infection.
The third infection that comes from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, 15 July.
He was diagnosed with the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infestation.
In addition, two of the border groups were identified and are waiting for the outcome of further studies, such as a plant in the infected countries.
Finally, the report states: The Secretary-General of the European Union and the Secretary-General of the United Nations are urgent for people to take care of caution and keep in mind that the individual-bound infection.
If the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to take a screening at the next health clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the camp site posted about the shopkeeper's privacy - Direct guests other
The camp site in Patrexfjordur is fully booked this weekend, according to the announcement of Vesturbjörður.
You can take a look at the other accommodation options.
Nur Vestbydídal, Tálknafjörður, Melanes at Raðasandi, Hotel Fólkalund and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the position.
It’s going to be on Patræksfjörður this weekend, as previous years will be Skjaldborg, festival Icelandic documentary held in town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the city.
The application in the camp site to judge may expect a good meeting this year, if the weather does not put a line in an account, but DV said earlier today from a destitute forecast.
I can expect the worst weather, and hope for the Patráksfjörður.
The web bb.is first said, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already completed.
The whole townhouse is groved down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free on Dunhaga in 1820.
During the course of construction, the owners will be eligible for re-establishment, but their skills have been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, most beautiful and most expensive neighborhoods of Reykjavík, there is a rural multi-city house on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house there are two ladders, each of which retains four fairly clean apartments.
They range from 93 to 301 square meters, but most of them are over 100.
The house has a great history to store.
It was built in 1959 and has been hosting video rentals, the Skófell, the milk shop Mjóllskollskollskollskolen, Jóa gunst, fish sales, and now the last university camp.
The house has, so the weight of the words is taken, the mouth of the elephant of beauty.
The house is now largely damaged, as can be seen in accompanying images.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
Owners D18 ehf. are, according to the company’s records, among others Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lársdóttir.
Magnús went for a private group of Borgingur and was a defender of the city's ownership.
In a group of its owners, Stálskip ehf.
Helgu Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third party in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Águs Guðmundur Sigurðursson, had one of their chosen ships.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has little to do with it since then.
My neighbors say that the situation of the house has been growing ever since, but most of the time in recent years.
On Facebook’s website, one resident said that the house was “not very life-threatening last year.”
You can play in the fact that the owners have a few years left after changing the house and the tree.
Other neighbours say the house has not been okay for a long time.
“It’s been a long time to do something public about this thing and it’s boring that it’s gone like that.”
He also says that he’s cool in the owner’s house for failing to finish this, finding someone in common flirting with the neighboring house and stopping this “legal practice”.
“Do this only in collaboration with the community around it so you can get involved in it and finish it.”
The “Laughs app” that is ready for the planning process of the field that has been in progress since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 after the permission to build a hill on the existing multi-storey house and behind the house, bought a new elevator and building on one floor as well as basement.
The building permit provided for that operation was dear to the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, and the Committee ruled it out of force where the implementation was not satisfactory.
The city of Reykjavík began with a divisional work and ended it with an advertisement in the Board of Directors in July of the previous year.
It was also very friendly, and the committee decided that it was valid in March 2020.
At this point, it was close to three years from the initial application of building permits and the owners of the house at the beginning.
At this time, the house had fallen down considerably and the neighbors turned out to be tired.
When DV asked the neighboring house in the situation and the response neighbors were answered in a number of ways.
Some people had an understanding of the owners of the house, others not at all.
The rest of the people were angry with the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but nothing really happened to anyone.
Other people said the parking lot is clean, but neighbors have a new unlisted parking lot Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicles.
One person in the case said a long time ago about the government:
“Let’s go through the process in three hours is amazing.
“It’s as if Reykjavík couldn’t read.”
Today the house is empty, abandoned and is inconvenient.
It was a response to the collapse of the city’s administration and noble plans for the owners and many years of work that is now at the beginning.
When a journalist wore a garden on Dunhaga 18, he broke up with the galloping animals and trash jars.
Playstation-TV and new TV are low within the rest of the world — victims of Icelandic summer events.
Opened into the old office of the University College, and there was talk of cats of the horticulture to judge.
It is clear that someone has fallen into one corner, but no one can see it.
Tables of sofas and beds and some boards of geothermal paper pages, which may have to be written, resolved.
The streets of the apartment were also open and life in both of them.
The reporter was so lucky to be on the other side of the city.
We were there to grab a potato dish for dinner and put the newspaper in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time, and the DV states that the company has nothing to pay for the house except heat and electricity.
Due to the state of the house, it is not difficult to enter a lease.
Of the posts in the lobby of the house to judge is clear that there have been a lot of foreign workers in the last few weeks.
Real employees have not been part of the Covid-19 situation, yet a contraction in tourism led to the contraction of the construction facilities, and these two industries are what are most likely to be using the services of employees.
Nevertheless, homeowners at Dunhaga 18 have enough to do and the working gears and winters in the cooperative to serve after a long working day in the rain.
However, despite the terrible situation of the house, the apartment seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist told the boys the bed was suddenly clear: At the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of real estate were settled.
Owners want to change the house to improved and neighbors want to improve the situation, but share the definition of ‘breeding’.
Between the site of the city’s planning area at the beginning, victims of endless stress and distress in the planning process and the phase-finding solutions Committee on Environmental and Natural Resources.
In the house, so Romanian workers, maybe just those who go to improve the situation, when the Icelandics stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the DV Journal on July 17th.
In the event of excessive weight following the corrovirus epidemic
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in the campaign against overweight, which will include, among other things, a ban on cacheitauglycerides, following his illness seriously, in part due to his weight.
Johnson presents the campaign, which has been named Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors are encouraged to prescribe bikes for their shelter in excess of weight and will also be expected to increase the cycle rate.
There will be a call for a television call to be banned at 21 a.m. in the evening, according to the British media sources.
“COVID-19 has raised our interest in short-term and long-term risk of being in excess of weight, and the Prime Minister is determined to use the time to become a health healthier, working and eating healthy food,” the spokesman said.
Johnson himself has had a weight problem of war, but he was put into custody when he was infected by the coronavirus in ours, and it is part of his weight due to which he has suffered so seriously.
Women are more likely to lead the change.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater distribution of power, transparency and in the process of combating corruption and of the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gear a bit now and who is better at leading such changes than the group of communities that are easier to be in these values.
“There are women,” said Helga.
“Consons in Iceland are famous for their women’s relationships.
Stay together and be together to lead change.
So now we’re just going to lead these changes.”
She said she was a bit curious about the focus of Iceland as “best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not as prepared to see what to do.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's hell.
We need to know where we are coming and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of the soldiers.
“We don’t have the same rules here,” Helga said.
She told women to be in many respects in good terms in Iceland, but added that, as well as elsewhere, Icelanders built a very male value.
She said that the government turned to form its own interests, authority, and power that were the ones that belonged to the abuses of all the communities.
“Kone is now building this group and coming together and is just a little annoyed by the fact that the Althing wants to move forward this national election from 2012,” she said.
“That’s the kind of value we’re thinking about.
From human rights and natural protection, cooperation and that we all sit on the same table," she said, adding that the previous committee value was the baseline in the new Constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural wealth and it’s ridiculous that there are people who live in poverty.
“It’s ridiculous, we can change differently,” Helga said.
“It’s ridiculous that it’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always lower.
“It’s ridiculous that nurses and nurses need to end up standing in the basement just to catch the manpower.”

I tried to start a road trip in the middle of the city.
A man was arrested in the middle of the night after he threatened the pedestrians and tried to get his money.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Iceland, where two were arrested for the case.
Then the driver stopped a motorbike in Hlíðarðir, where the driver was at 146 km speed where the maximum speed is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn in the night, and there were about 80 cases recorded in the journal police from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise for the same reason.
On Saturday morning, reports were made on the common sound and it was a great deal in the newspaper police.
On the night of that night, there were 22 noises on board the police.
Six were in jail last night.
In the city, police were called in the night when air-tight aircraft were launched.
They had been attacked when police officers had to park.
Nine drivers were arrested for drinking and or drug abuse.
Four people were arrested for fighting in the middle of the night, but one of them was trapped in prison.
Two were taken to an emergency room after they fell on the face, one in the middle and the other in the west.
One was transferred to an accident after he was injured jumping on trampoline in Copavogi.
In addition, police officers stationed the driver who was driving a caravan at Kjalarnes yesterday.
The caravan's caravan was, according to a diary police officer, "very bad condition" and it was quiet.
Can be found in the house Monet about the shopping weekend
The house, which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in, is now leased to the Airbnb website.
The next night in the house is about the shopping weekend.
The house is small and quaint, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.
He lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint the gardens famous in this house.
If someone wants to rent the house, he will be renting at least two nights.
On the Airbnb page, it is next loose after a week, on Sunday’s shopping weekend, and therefore may be ideal for some shoppers on vacation to book a house.
The two bills over the shopping weekend cost not less than 964 U.S. dollars or just more than 130 thousand Icelandic kronor after the news gets the next.
Tugs in cattle and some of them are beginning to show the symptoms of the disease caused by corrugated vertebrae.
Five have been identified with the virus virus within the last three days and most of them are infected undisclosed.
Tugs have come to the ground for this and some of them are beginning to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the disease.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus within the country yesterday and two at the border border.
A specialist in the office of a doctor says that the growing number of domestic abuses does not necessarily mean that hunting is spread widely into the community.
“It’s been reported from the former insider and there’s a road that hasn’t been seen here before so we don’t have a reason to think she’s been living in the community for some time.
“This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very well at the moment,” said Kamilla Sigríður Josephsdóttir, a specialist in the field of medical medicine.
Most of them have been infected in connection with individuals who came from abroad.
Further screenings will take place in the next, but some who were interacting with the infected are expected to show the signs of the coronavirus.
“Nunna is not fluent in the process and less about other respiratory tract infections so we can be quite liberal with doing this test on individuals who during the initial period had found a reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Smitting is mostly completed, but it is not possible that more people have to go to a hospital.
Two of the infected people were diagnosed after attending a sports event.
I have asked if it is possible to keep such an event.
The company’s managers say it is as long as people follow the criteria and regulations.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible for the others to get infected in the sport.
“If there are no more in isolation from these individuals after they have been reviewed, we can maintain that our responses to the tournament have worked.
“It’s not clear,” Kamilla said.
The company’s staff is in constant review.
“We need to be ready to bring in with further advice or restrictions if it seems appropriate,” Kamilla said.
After about a week, the number of people will be accommodated in a thousand people.

It’s okay to eat everything, not all at once and not always.”

Attacks between police and protesters in Seattle
The city authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of rebellion following the media protests in the city centre.
Police ran yesterday to the blast and piped to attempt to clean a large area that protesters laid themselves and stretched over many houses in the vicinity of the parliament in the city.
The police reported on Twitter that at least eleven protestors had been arrested and that a study of crimes committed at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
Civil and police officials say that protesters have shot police with grouts, bottles, wheat bombs and other loosely and were one police officer transferred to a hospital where the injuries were made.
The Seattle shootings were peaceful for a long time.
The bridge was for them to show protesters in Portland, Oregon, but in the city there has been a heavy strike between protesters and heavy-duty federal police officers.
As in more cities of the United States, people gathered together under the brand Black Lives Matter, reminiscent of Georges Floyds, who was killed by police officer in Minneapolis on 25 May, protesting systematic racism in the United States community and requiring a supplement.
Don’t be re-elected until after the vote
However, it does not apply to whether the flight operator Icelandair, which should be valid for the next month, will be re-elected.
The Annual General Meeting on the Complaints of Iceland’s Icelandic Air Forces on the hand of Icelandair will end at noon tomorrow.
Gudlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir’s chairman is convinced that Icelandair will not make a decision on the statements until the end of the vote.
“It’s all right,” says Gudlaug Líney.
“There has been no recollection, this must be done so that the machines can be used.
So people are sad to know if it’s going to happen after the month of the month.”
The deal is about a contract signed for the week before July 19th.
It is expected that he is valid until the end of September 2025, and builds on a contract that the airliner had previously entered into a vote.
On 17 July, the Icelandic Air Force and the Icelandic Armed Forces decided to announce a ceasefire at Icelandair, approved the members of the Board of Directors.
It never came to her, but it was decided after the decision of Icelandair to stop negotiations with the airline, say up all of their flights and look for deals with another union.
Then the pilots of the company had to take their jobs on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Gudlaug Liney says it’s hard to say about it.
“People are in pain after this incident, when all of the airline’s flights were reported and announced that the partnership would be a different union.
Now it turns out that it has an impact," she says.
940 airliners were employed at Icelandair at the end of April, but 900 of them were about 95%.
Their record is a misdemeanor, with those who have the highest employee, he has three months and will end the month of July-August.
There are about 90% of Icelandair’s flights.
What will the deal not be agreed?
“We want to continue our discussions with our peers.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he had refused, he would have been too far off.”
The vote on the election ends and Icelandair announces the second quarter of the year tomorrow.
A new vote will end at 12 noon tomorrow.
The settlement of Icelandairs for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but the preliminary results indicate that the company’s income has dropped about 85 percent from the same period last year.
The International Board of Directors on the Competition of Iceland and the Cooperation of Iceland for Icelandair began on Wednesday, 22 July, ending tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 noon at noon.
Those who can vote for the contract are the employees of Icelandair who pay the social debt to the airline company.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new referendum on Sunday, July 19 but Friday had been struggling with the company after flying coal stocks earlier in the election in early July.
Icelandair had said all the flights and aircraft of the company on Friday, but they were dragged back after a new vote was signed.
According to a new contract, flight drivers need to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The nuclear agreement is valid until the year 2025, but it has been integrated into the airfields of the pilots and the flight crews on how long to fly on a single guard.
The agreement was presented to the members of FFÍ at the meeting of the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, and described many airfares that news agencies filed with them over an indemnity due to the contract.
Most people agreed that it would be necessary to agree with the agreement to keep the FFÍ alive.
Icelandair’s dividends for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the EBIT’s profit for the financial and taxes is according to the annual tax rate of 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars or about 15 billion Icelandic krona.
Icelandair sent the Buyer’s interim accounts last Wednesday, but said that the company’s income has now reached about 60 million dollars in the fourth quarter or about 8.3 billion kronor.
The amount of money paid and its equivalent was about 154 million U.S. dollars at the end of the quarter, about 21 billion dollars.
Icelandair is also planning to offer the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair plans to complete a contract with the fifteenth loan fleet, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before going to a partial auction.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“There’s only one person who came abroad.
“This is not something that has been painted in the domestic region,” says Már Kristjánsson, a medical officer at the Landspital Hospital, who claims that “a kind of virus” has been found here.
Last night, three people were killed and two on the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the association of a sports club at the Rey Cup football team, but the infamous infection of the infection and infection is over.
Also, infection was detected in a person who came to the country on July 15 and are two who were in collaboration with him began to show signs of COVID-19.
In the past, infectious infections reported in the past day and after the diagnosis of Icelandic genetic diagnosis were found “a kind of virus that has not been identified here before.”
Societies are completed in connection with the infection.
It is not possible to discuss new viruses, but it is the same path that has spread across the world, including the new SARS-CoV-2.
It’s better to talk about a new variant of the virus, but about a new type of virus.
Ask what it means, and whether it could say something to the start of another urban epidemic, Már says that as if there is a single case to discuss, and it could be no more.
“However, if there are cases that are not associated with foreign relations and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then it could be possible to draw that conclusion [in the second wave], but it is not time to support it,” explains Már.
Congratulations on the hot pot
Is the secret of happiness in the hot pots?
The BBC’s journalists lead to the resemblance of a fun video that protects light on the swimming pool and hotspots of the country.
The Icelandic bathroom is special in the world, and it is clear that nowhere in the world is equally bathed in every population.
The natural soil is the basis of it, but also the tradition of the healthyness here.
Children's swimming activities were legal in 1940 and older citizens are not yet able to make use of the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
At mobile phones, people gather together on personal networks around home and space, or enjoy the like power of water: mind and battery of soul and body.
It’s hard to get a hundred days in the elections.
There are hundreds of days until the United States is elected to the election and elects the president for a four-year term.
Donald Trump is re-elected, but he’s still on the run.
Joe Biden, the prospective candidate of the Democratic Party, has a lot of regrets on Trump’s national holiday, is taken by the polls.
According to a recent study by the AP, the U.S. estimates that the country is on the wrong track.
Trump’s reaction to the world’s new coronavirus is also very hostile and also counts more Americans than before the president has been in a bad position on economic issues.
Only two out of ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say Trump’s response is due to the epidemic and 48 percent say he’s been doing well in economic affairs.
In March, it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent on national television, while Trump is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his performances towards the aging of Biden, pushing under so-called cultural denunciations, and declaring policies that should be reversed by law and regulation.
Biden, however, has a lot to do with Trump’s attention and to count a lot of chances of winning out of cities if the election really touches the way Trump has been working in the last four years.
Trump also seems to be going down to the Republican Party and fear that Democrats could even reach a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has already been very high.
Policeco said it was going to follow the categories and the candidate comparable, and now the Republican Party would have its greatest power in decades.
The environment has proved to be particularly bad in the 2016 elections and is now looking for this development to continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the urban environment to follow, including by saying that the President of the Biden will destroy the U.S. and push under racism.
Among other things, Trump has dropped down regulation from Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase the diversity of urban areas.
He then urged the U.S. House Department to read a article after former New York State Secretary, stating that Biden would destroy the U.S. and take Trump under it.
“The child will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!" said the president.
The U.S. population is increasingly expanding.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, he has received the majority of the votes of the President of this group.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority vote from this group, but lost to Barack Obama.
The investigations have shown that despite Trump’s assurance of the vast majority of the districts in 2016, his follow-up has been greatly disrupted.
Although there is a difference between the polls, Biden has estimated about fifteen percent ahead of Trump.
Regis Philbin has died
American television host Regis Philbin has died at 88.

The number of co-workers, friends, and fans have mentioned him on social media last 24 hours.
Will the Olympics light up at the end of the day?
After the final decision had been taken to delay the Olympics, an event that only world wars have been overthrown to this end, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympics would be famously “the light of the end of the times,” and predicted the world war on the world-famous coronavirus that the world-building nation has now penetrated through unity.
The Afghans have a year to prepare themselves and the government of Japan is adding to the cost of the late fall.
Everyone has a lot to do with it.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese representatives were unlucky.
They cried and laughed for a while, but Tókókók had decided to keep playing in 2016 but laid out it changed in lower places held for Rio, Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled to take place on 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for years and will begin on 23 July 2021 and will end on 8 August.
If you don’t have to keep playing them, if the coroner is still too much danger, you’ll stop playing.
No one really wants to think about it.
Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show is always great and is looking for the top of the last game.
The choice of city for Olympics is based on the food selection committee of the cities.
The more important it is — the more likely it will be.
In 2016, there were 150 million dollars in trying to keep the 2016 Olympics or nearly 20 billion kronor.
In the second half, when the game was played in 2020, 75 million dollars were spent, about ten billion dollars, put into the race.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo had been playing this year, the Japanese authorities had the amount of $30 billion for the project.
However, the amount is only drop in the sea compared to what it costs to build an Olympic stadium, stage and generally to strengthen the interior of the country to attack such a tournament, prepare it and keep the players themselves.
Officials in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which had been going on these days, had been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
According to a report by the government in Japan that came out at the end of last year, however, it was concluded that the cost was twice the same.
Probably, the cost of delaying the games may not be enough, but the estimated cost of two to six billion dollars may be added to the initial cost.
The total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
It’s so high that all taxes in the Icelandic state would only amount to about half of the Olympics, compared to the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are the events of the magnitude that they have liked to have become a topic of economics, trying to explore the benefits and discounts of the games.
In fact, a lot of people seem to have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is still so positive for their economy paying them.
Tax-time effects are someone, for example, increasing jobs very much for a short time, but for a long time, cities tend to sit up with debt and the threat-driven operation cost little used manpower.
Rio in Brazil sits up with significant debts due to the 2016 games and has been in trouble with costing all the big athletes who were built for the players.
It has been reported that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
This means that we don’t talk about new jobs except in a small way.
In general, cities have not gotten very well out of the financial position of keeping Olympics because of the outrageous cost that comes with the man-made ones built for the players.
The winnings are, however, often referred to as an increase in tourists who want to visit the Olympics following the games, which is still very uncertain about the 2021 playoffs.
It is also unclear whether you can take all the crowds who are usually taking the players.
The main issue is the honor of the cities to be elected, but it is difficult to appreciate money.
In spite of the enormous cost, you can also say that the joy that the games move is not the nature of being able to put on that price.
But if the show is a big deal and there is no saving, it’s not just about money.
There are the sports that are in the foreground.
For some people, it’s just a pleasure to postpone the games.
Australia’s five-year-old and gold prize winner in his article on the Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, a cashier and had been away from a good game this summer, but some hope to be in a competition form for the players 2021.
It is among those athletes who are just rather pleased with the temptation, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who wanted to stop after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, meaning the temptation of the games in some cases that they stop the competition before the games take place.
Try your body simply not to go over the years through the supplement of the strict exercises.
Few athletes were equally successful in the hearts of the Olympics in Rio 2016 and the star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold on her neck and one bronze.
Cars have appeared in some interviews in their home country lately to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to play 2021, but she's not sure she's still on the top of the games next year, she'll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not the number of hairs age, it is at a higher level for performance in the leading order.
“It’s a delicate issue,” Biles said, but smiles out in another interview published on the Instagram website of the Olympic Committee asked whether she’s going to get equal on the 2021 games and she did in June 2016.
“I don’t really know if I’m still on top after a whole year in addition to training,” Biles said.
She has previously mentioned that her body does not tolerate the strain that comes with exercise for much longer.
However, she has a race for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop suddenly exercising when the world-famous weather was shut down and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Cares rather than anyone else while all the athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold could not buy any access over the others, she had to find various ways to keep it in shape like others.
The basics are better than most people.
“We have a strong plan now.
It was hard to start exercising again after the opening of the gym.
We started slowly, but we’re in full shape and I’m going to increase the training as much as I’m concerned about what’s going on this year.
Of course, we don’t know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice that they will be, we can’t do anything else.
“I’ve spent too much time leaving the sport now,” Biles said.
With her as a multi-faceted doubt or perhaps rather conscious that the game may be held at all 2021, but not at all.
But to think about it is hopeless.
No one can know how the world-renowned coronavirus will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do than prepare for the Olympics based on the fact that they will be held a year.
Maybe the Olympics will be the light of the end of the Covid era.
A wedding due to the epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone his wedding due to the coronavirus.
She had to marry former bachelorette champion Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other important things to think about right now," said the actor in conversation with People.
“We want to get married sometime and have that dream wedding and have all of our loved ones.
But we decided to attack it at a time and focus on what’s important right now and it’s helping to share information about the importance of being with a mask and staying at home.
I look more at the world than the weddings these days.
There are a lot of things going on and we should draw our attention to what’s happening in the world.”
