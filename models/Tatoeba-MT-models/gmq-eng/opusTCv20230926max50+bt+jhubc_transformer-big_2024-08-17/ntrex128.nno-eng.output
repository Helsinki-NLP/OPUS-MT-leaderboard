Welsh members of the parliament are afraid of not being taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently dismayed by a proposal to change their name from Assembly member or AM (assembly member) to Member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group is concerned by your "MWP rhymes with Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means foolish and "pwp" means poop.
A member from the Plaid party said that the group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group has an "open mind" when it comes to the name change, but added that the MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w pronounced is not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The parliament's delegation, which is now writing bills to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on what members of the parliament should be named will, of course, be up to members themselves."
A 2017 Welsh official decision gave the parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the naming proposals which demonstrated considerable support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the National Assembly members, the delegation prefers Welsh Member of Parliament or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members have apparently made other proposals, but the struggle to agree has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, a headache. She is due to turn in the bill in a couple of weeks.
The enactment of the reforms contains other changes for the functioning of the delegation as well, including rules on the disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on what to name when debating the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters are to vote on Sunday if they are to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was decided to resolve a conflict that has been going on for many decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he will ignore the result.
Those supporting the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin are stilling as the churches of Harlem, New York, are struggling
"The old people I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a cow on every corner," Adams said.
"Today, none of the parts exist."
He said he understands why the bars are disappearing.
"People socialize in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Bars are no longer stalls in the neighborhood that people visit by default."
As for the cows, he's worried that the money from selling the properties isn't going to last as long as the tenants think, "and sooner or later they're back where they started."
He added that cattle can be replaced by share apartments filled with the kind of people who don't care to help the historic sites in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy share apartments in these buildings are white," he said. "and that's how the day comes when all the churches are closed, because it's not likely that these people who move into the share apartments are going to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built from white parishes before Harlem became a black borough—the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black parish that had preached nearby moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black parish led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem where the owners were opposed to hiring or promoting blacks.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Reverend Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, Johnson's senior son and successor in Saint Martin, was proud and called the chimes "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played on the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first carillon in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who leaves the church to play on the larger carillon in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said Saint Martin could not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in recent months has turned into a complicated account of architects and construction workers, some of them added by the lay leaders of the church, and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, which presides over the parish and consists of the leaders of the laity, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would ask the sacristy to pay," although the sacristy was not involved in the diocese's appointment of architects and construction workers.
Some of the parish's members have complained about the lack of openness on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old injured by shark during hummer dive in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help. He paddled away to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the boy was thrilled to have caught a lobster, before realizing that the boy was shouting, "Something bit me!
Something bit me!"
"His entire collarbone was ripped off," Hammel said that he observed when he reached the boy.
"I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was picked up by air ambulance and taken to Rady Hospital for Children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It is unknown what type of shark it was that regretted the boy.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a couple of weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's retail chain focuses on beauty products
British retail chain Sainsbury's is to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' beauty products and offer department store services in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion and interior sales go down, Sainsbury's is to test their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more stores if it becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be full of tvs, microwave ovens and interiors now stand empty.
Sainbury's said they will double the number of beauty products to 3,000 products and offer the Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw brands for the first time.
They should give the branded L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand such as in the Boots stores.
The store will also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most products vegan, which should attract more young customers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test sales of its perfumes at two of Sainsbury's stores: the first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second is due to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Action online and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small shops mean that large retail chains must find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like department stores, while the retail chains are trying to fight off low-price stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has joined the Argos interior chain in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since buying both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased food sales and so defended the acquisition.
The chain's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaborated with Boots in the early 2000s, but this came to an end when the parties did not agree on how to share the profits from the pharmacies in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the Celesio pharmacy chain, which had 281 pharmacies and owned the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and is to offer an extended luxury range of skin products, including branded La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how beauty shelves will look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also appointed colleagues with special expertise who will be able to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that detracts from the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'racing' after Holly Willoghby resigns from deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
The star of the television programme Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "racing" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote their interior and worship brand Truly.
The couple's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host from the program This Morning, 37, made the news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, amid the development of their new partnership on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "racing" when the golden Holly confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at Jones's business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – mean she no longer has time to collaborate on the interior and worship brand Truly.
The partnership has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make known that she should not work with Truly, while Jones ran away from Britain to calm down in one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was certainly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to pull out has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed their own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to launch.
There is a department store in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the decision of the This Morning host, who is one of the richest stars in the UK, may cost the company millions due to hefty investment in products, from pillows to candles to clothing and interiors, and may cause delays with the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the Truly brand with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Para vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Tough conversations "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment some might experience as "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his nonsense voice as a "newsreader".
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in another meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the nuclear weapons program in North Korea.
But negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have halted.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "corresponding response" from the United States regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, the U.S. continues with sanctions to pressure North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results – the end of rocket testing, aid in the release of hostages and the return of the levees to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach when it comes to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing to the group standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid agencies were told there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok residents had to flee, no one declared a national emergency, which is necessary to get international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear that they do not want international aid, so it is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain whether employees with foreign passports will be allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the Agency for National Crisis in Indonesia, said that authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is prone to earthquakes frequently, it is not particularly prepared for the forces of nature.
In the Aceh area, they have built tsunami shelters, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more victims.
Travelling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat those damaged in the earthquake is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the betterment of infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also being pressured regarding sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking it up and towards the goal.
The attempt sealed high above the penalty area and swept towards the right upper corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the goal.
"I was just trying to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq are trying to get as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came and dropped the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the break after the score in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before spanning off near midfield into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic took the ball quickly in midfield.
Then he shot it in a nice way and led Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defence and scoured with his left foot right past keeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool are to play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday in the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are to play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Number of victims in Indonesia tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims in the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the emergency agency in the country reported early Sunday.
Many people became trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, which occurred on Friday and had a magnitude of 7.5 followed by 20-foot waves, the spokesman for the emergency agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.
British police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has started after a woman was found murdered in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning early.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 07:55 in Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man has been arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have requested tips about the incident from local residents.

I also urge everyone, including taxi drivers, who can he caught something on dashboard cameras, to contact us in case they have important information."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found is from Birkenhead and that she was found in a home.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the area to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police have stated that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to make his way into his own apartment, but has been told by police that no one will be allowed to enter or leave the building.
He didn't know what to say when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told they will not be allowed to enter their apartments for many hours.
Someone overheard a police officer say to a man that the whole area is a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She says again and again "it's so terrible".
At 2 p.m., two police cars could be seen within the police tape and another police car outside the tape.
A crowd of policemen stood within the police tape and observed a block of apartments.
If anyone has information they can send DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling +44 (0) 800 555 111 with the reference "log 247 from 30 September".
Parliament statue of Cromwell becomes latest victim of "rewriting of history"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious artifacts in England by his Puritan followers during the 17th century Civil War.
But the Cromwell Association described Crick's proposal for the removal of the statue as "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, the chairman of the Cromwell association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace should become a target.
Iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 19th century, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still think it is worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, regarded as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was, of course, against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not remains a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual who we know represented one side of that divide.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Mordargris attack and kill Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, surnamed Yuan, was found dead, with his artery cut and covered with blood, near a pig pen at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines on a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the gate to one of the pig pens was open.
He said that in the bin was a large male pig with blood around its mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilogram pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," said the cousin, named Wu, to the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras show Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The marketer told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the leader of the market.
Although rare, such attacks by pigs have happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, giving the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kilo pig held a Welsh farmer trapped between himself and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive by default, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"They just want to play.
They like to bite a bit, they're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa Bring Rain to Southwest U.S.
As predicted in the weather report, Hurricane Rosa is weakening over the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will carry pouring rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had wind speeds up to 80 miles per hour (136 km/h) and was a Category 1 hurricane until 5:00 a.m. in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 400 miles (620 kilometers) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low over the Pacific Ocean is moving east toward the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north to the southwest United States.
Pink will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with the low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous floods and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the southwestern United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States; especially over much of Arizona.
Hazardous flooding can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It warned against trips in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
Rain can turn canyons into flooded rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfalls of over 1 centimetre are possible, which can create small floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Scattered tropical rainstorms will start in Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before rain increases late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October may witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic is getting colder, but tropical regions will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central United States.
There is a nearly 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start to October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the Great Plains to parts of the northeast United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term forecast indicates that there are high chances of above-average temperatures in the Eastern United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million watch Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, political discussion around the case continued, with interruptions in the regular television programs by various broadcasting companies to reveal the latest news on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the charges within the next week.
Ford told the High Court Committee that she is 100 percent sure Kavanaugh felt her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sentimental interview, that he is 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the interception on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company arrived at this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels showing the intercept, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also having trouble counting viewers watching from the office.
To put this into perspective, a similar number of viewers watch an American football finale or the Oscars.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the network was also the one with the most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate Republican, declared that he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS as Protestants shouted for him on his way to a hearing with a judges' committee on Friday.
He stood staring at the ground for several minutes as protesters yelled at him on CNN live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe he's telling the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, whereas so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office has spoken out, and before entering the elevator said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The broadcasting agencies showed the hearing on tv when the judges' committee was due to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full Senate and further vote.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh over the next week, which Democrats have also requested.
Flake was informed in part after talking to his buddy, Democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision turned out to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not voice Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for 'playing politics' when it comes to Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, blames critics of her plans to leave the EU for "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom without regard to national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party conference on September 29, 2018.
Next to the interview with May on the front page of the Sunday Times is an interview with former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, in which he calls for the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's taxes is "totally absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for wilful murder, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, say.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the brawl.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report by the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After his interrogation with Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at $350,000, reports local newspaper The Advocate.
The Coroner of the East Baton Rouge publicized an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
Baton Rouge police thank the Louisiana State Police's Special Agents, the State Police's Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department, and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The athletic director at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being "watchful in the attainment of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 rebounds per game the previous season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "comfortless" after Wayde was killed.
"This is something we're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Emergency Prevention is asking Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and ash releases within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumblings and tremors.
Photos on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in various Mexico City neighborhoods, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists within the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence clashed with police officers, and thousands of other protesters protested against independence one year after the vote for eventual separation from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police officers as they threw eggs and powder coatings, creating dark clouds of dust in streets usually filled with tourists.
Collisions also broke out later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours the separatists shouted, "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the protestors against independence shouted, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries after the protests.
There is still a lot of pressure in the region, and many will still have their independence one year after the October 1 vote, which was called illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted for independence, but there was also a low voter turnout among those who opposed independence and boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the scuffle and violent clashes occurred in the region.
Groups in favor of independence slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer has any hope of independence in Catalonia.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy in order to voice their independence, but now we are stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that are in favor of independence are struggling to retain power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or under arrest while awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of police on her phone, said that the conflict was hashed up by police officers on both sides.
"The tension is increasing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been part of ongoing trials since last year, declared that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"Running as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the setback of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Men arrested for deliberately crashing a car into houses

Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the car caused damage to the entrance gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may have been used to fire at the car.
Menga-shot gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Excited Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second stint after 18 games coaching the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot turned out to make the difference while Gary Holt's side levelled Hibernian in second.
Gerrard's side have no away wins in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and will play Hearts, who they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has six consecutive stints, and head coach Holt has still not lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against away team
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, causing more problems for the Rangers with their live play.
Scott Robinson broke through but had low effort towards goal, which forced Alan Lithgow to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal became scorched.
Rangers agreed to a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson headed for Menga, who took a touch and scoured from the middle of the penalty area.
By then, Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that home defense was solid and keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman attempted to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flicked wide after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passings were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalty area, while two penalties – following Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one at hand – were waved away.
'Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal match and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their playing and playing style has barely changed since they returned to top class, but much of the thanks for that goes to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he became coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a defense at the military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the fight.
Rangers, by contrast, were not motivated.
Yet as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and only cut up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize they don't reach up anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The state leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue skies as they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29 in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which it is hoped will repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have been divided on human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque due to "security reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters turned up to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurdish – also showed up to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to welcome him into the country.
The dueling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who see Erdogan as a hero, and others, who see him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: Cyclist killed after car collision
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a car London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast London, at 10:15 a.m. local time.
The car driver stopped and paramedics quickly arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred just a couple of months after another cyclist died when the driver ran off in Childers Street, about a mile (1.6 km) from today's accident.
London police reported that they are in the process of identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a men's high-security prison, the prison office in England says.
Ongoing disorder broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces have been obtained to calm the rebellion, involving eight prisoners in a secluded part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained guards should calm the ongoing insurgency in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to go to jail longer."
It seats more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in Britain.
In June, it was reported that the warden was being treated for injuries, after a prisoner went to jail.
And last October, Special Agents had to come to the prison to calm a serious riot, where prisoners threw pool balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flooding (in favor of drought areas)
Tropical lows are rare in Arizona, but there is just such a weather phenomenon heading towards Arizona early next week, in which the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move southwest across the desert causing fear of flooding.
The national weather service has issued warnings against flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and may already be producing rain late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometers within the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can rain between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the southwest desert, including central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with isolated totals up to 10 centimeters.
For the areas beyond flood risk, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing in the dry.
Although flooding is a serious concern, this rain is likely to benefit areas in the southwestern United States prone to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, there is extreme drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest drought category, weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa will be moving across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of more than 135 kilometers per hour, on Sunday morning Rosa is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and so calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico by tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
It is going to rain a lot in parts of Mexico, which can increase the risk of flooding.
"Rain between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimeters," reported weather.com.
Rosa will migrate north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will migrate further up through Arizona into south Utah Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger with Rosa or its remains, is heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the American southwest desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening flooding in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police report.
Police have urged people who may have mobile footage of what happened to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered" under how "bad and angry" Democrats were against him
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the relentless and unreasonable tactics of Democrats," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered" under how "bad and angry" the Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave testimony in front of Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying the charge by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her crimes during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people got to see how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice of one of the most capable lawyers of our time, a lawyer with flawless service in public," he told a crowd of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when talking about the importance for Republicans to run in the U.S. midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I travel around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are out to "resist and block."
The first important vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, numbers killed increase
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people gathered to take part in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, struck the beach at sunset, taking a lot of people as they destroyed everything they came across.
The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the warning about the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not leave immediately and so they became victims," stated Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the Indonesia BNPB crisis relief agency, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami wasn't enough in itself, he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses; he rammed everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over open seas at a speed of 500 miles per hour before reaching the coast.
Some climbed into trees to avoid the tsunami and survived in that way.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos published by the emergency agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes could be felt in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Technology Testing and Testing Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday, was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bomb over Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, located on the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found under the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the size of the devastation may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication has been cut" said Nugroho.
"More than 300,000 people live there," stated the Red Cross, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the stricken areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The emergency agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said waves came within the time period notified.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building calling desperately to humans down the streets to warn them against the commanding wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not verify the video at first.
The quake and tsunami caused power outages and cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has started the process of sending in cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of fatalities in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
The World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu city, and have set up tents in the back yard of their office. On their way to the city, they passed completely destroyed areas, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
As relief agencies begin efforts to help those affected by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign relief workers with expertise in emergency management have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid agencies and their staff cannot start work until Indonesia has declared that the area is a national emergency zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"There is a crisis at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the state says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,' we can open for international emergency aid, but they haven't updated the status yet."
It's night again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those who are still slowed down are still hoping for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters don't pla end well.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had been medically trapped next to her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandino, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the slowed-down paragliders from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Mandagi said that some of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As someone with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to carry," he said.
Gendon told me that he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages only showed a grey chin, instead of two blue chins.
"I think that means the messages didn't get through," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from ATM in Newport, Levee, USA
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a worker at the Brink's company in what he was filling up an ATM in Newport, Levee, United States, according to a Newport police press release.
The worker had just cleared an ATM in the entertainment area and was delivering more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy stated in the press release.
As the worker was busy, a man "jumped up behind the worker" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects as they fled the scene, according to the press release, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was scheduled to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He is replacing singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled due to "emotional reasons," the program host said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" said West earlier this year when discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye - to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also changed the writing style of the name with and without a hyphen and capital letters.
Future President of Mexico vows not to send the military against civilians
The future President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians.The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military fired on peaceful protesters, killing about 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were spreading in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led youths to join criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Investment in Artificial Intelligence
Since China is working more actively on artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in research on the subject, says investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government stated about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
A doubling in funding may double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month via publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the managing director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest ranked player of the game Othello, and later worked as an executive at Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized past technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked what time the next competition will be, so that he joins in identifying the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China taking the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired excellent students from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies may also help the United States strengthen research into artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence should be granted automatic residency," he said.
The State Council of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Association of Natural Sciences funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. National Science Association and other government organizations' way of distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the forming of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI (Artificial Intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, no one has worked on the national security and artificial intelligence bills for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether they should change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from joining the EU and NATO.
Greece, whose province is named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to their territory, and has used veto to vote against membership for Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change may undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has cast doubt on whether the referendum will reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the referendum bill is: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and agree with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership of the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to voice for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding under the law, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said they will follow the result of the vote to make it conclusive.
For the name change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds turnout.
The state election committee reported that nothing unusual had happened by 1:00 p.m.
Only 16 percent had cast their ballots, in contrast to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters cast their ballots.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voiced in Strumika in the Macedonian referendum for whether to change their name and open to joining NATO and the EU on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of the parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not for changing the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that membership in NATO will attract investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I think that the majority is going to vote for the change, of which 80 percent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after voting.
He said a "yes" result could be interpreted as a "confirmation of our future."
A poll last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum – which is below the required number.
Another poll of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said that 70 percent would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be closed, at least 50 per cent must vote, plus one vote.
If the referendum fails to close, it could harm the policies of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through the Brighton defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling vacated the Brighton defence resulting in a 2–0 win for Manchester City on Saturday in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look laughably easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker took on a pass on the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He rushed past three Brighton defenders and reached open ground.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He made it around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty field.
He got past a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English striker used his first kick in the field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero is still struggling with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him being able to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blues the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero accepted the ball deep inside the Brighton territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of the court to Leroy Sane.
Sane held onto the ball while leading Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into the goal just before slipping out of the court.
City are to play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play spoiler against the Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to force a fresh start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, and hopes to take the "mound" on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to a "playoff" for the Rockies, who are leading by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but look forward to locking up the First Division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team most likely to play at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with relationships like that, right?"
It is still unknown who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may be "pitche".
Scherzer, who in that case starts for the 34th time, threw a "bullpen session" on Thursday and will be "pitching" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3 "innings" this season.
Trump Gathers Voters in West Virginia
The president obscurely referred to his Supreme Court first-choice nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of voting in the U.S. midterm elections.
"Everything we've done so far is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm running around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this appalling, appalling group of Democrats, you see it's happening right now.
And they're convinced that they're absolutely going to take back power, you see how horrible they are, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take the power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "oppose and block."
"And you can see that based on the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry and mean and nasty and dishonest."
He was referring to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who caused his audience to boo.
"Remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, er no, I expect - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant of those who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party ran to censor me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs who have been told I am not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of running a responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar issues about which Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders.
The call for the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday, stated "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In my last eight years as a Labour MP the Friday meetings have been just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like that, and the promise of "kinder" politics is long forgotten, if it was followed at all.
It has become more and more apparent that different points of view are not tolerated in Labour and that every opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues I tended to politically agree with suddenly expected me to change my mind and agree on issues I would never agree with - whether it was about national security or the single market in the EU.
When I speak in public it doesn't matter what I say, I always get yelled at on social media and people want me to resign while criticising centre politics and saying I shouldn't be a member of the Labour party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get sexist and racist harassment directed at them every day and who are still professional and don't resign.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normalized it has become to harass police officers.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should become more tolerant.
In reality, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone; for every motion of no confidence and for every change in the party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I've received a lot of advice in the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still in school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government was failing the country. My classroom was collapsing, so I wanted better public services for those who need them most – whether as a municipal councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, even in the previous election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any doubt as to what I stand for and which of the current leaders I do not agree with.
To those who voted for the bill on Friday, I can only say that when the country rushes towards a Brexit that will harm private, local businesses and public services, I do not understand why people care to waste energy questioning my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But in fact, the only message I have addressed to Nottingham Momentum is not to the electorate, whether they are Labour electors or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can make me resign or change my policies and prevent me from serving you in the way that I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to top in Scottish rugby
Two late "tries" might have changed the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr managed to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They now stand on top of the podium as the only invincible team out of a total of ten.
It was their superb defense and ability to take chances that gave their home team and coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be happy.
"We've been put to the test in the last few games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy after all," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr deserves praise, they were better than us at taking chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" in the 14th minute, where Frazier Climo attempted a "conversion," putting Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes of the Warriors allowed Melrose to assemble, and Jason Baggot took an "unconverted try."
Climo received a penalty just before the break, he scorched and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which was "converted" by Baggot, reduced wobble by five points.
There was a long pause when Ruaridh Knott became seriously injured and laid on a stretcher, and from the restart Ayr fawned forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, as Climo "converted."
The acting captain for Ayr, Blair MacPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose attempted an "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball from the penalty line, MacPherson scored a "try."
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent the "flanker" Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth "try."
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant business
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business, after it was discovered that he is the CEO of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC programme, which he writes and plays in with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season is going to be the last, and it seems Kiernan is planning life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will not comment on the matter, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has hinted that Kiernan would involve himself in the "progressive restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia hopes court will open waterway to Pacific
Sailors patrol naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with ocean blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and duty to return to it."
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still recall a coastline lost to Chile, in a bloody 19th-century conflict over resources, longing to sail the Pacific once again.
These hopes are perhaps stronger than in many decades while Bolivia awaits the verdict of the International Court of Justice due on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has drive, serenity and is united, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the ruling of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the court in The Hague supports Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - gives Bolivia an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who is struggling to be elected again next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"Now we'll get back to the Pacific soon," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts do not believe the Court is going to allow Bolivia access to the sea - and that little would have changed even if they were granted access.
The Netherlands-based UN court does not have the power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the court's ruling comes just six months after the latest negotiations indicates that the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have far from advanced Bolivia's case, they have done the opposite.
"The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
Morales, with his belligerent rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate thought.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile" and a chance to "set a bar at 139 years of impropriety and rather benefit both of them," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win votes.
“Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
"The verdict is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the U.S.
The North Korean foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on the promise they made during the Singapore meeting between the U.S. and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the United States' foreign minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart his stuck nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the U.S. has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the U.S. continues with sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean War.
Washington refuses to agree to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang deposing first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, will hold another meeting.
But many are critical of the fact that Pyongyang is serious about its downsizing and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headwear is the latest fashion on its way to a shopping street near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you don't have to search anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special headwear in their SS19 collection. The headwear amazed the audience during the fashion week in Paris.
Highly impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right onto the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a lavish, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, wide brim covering the models' heads.
There were also other oversized worship items during the fashion show, including a jeweled watermelon, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this hugely dramatic fashion, you can just rejoice.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats will come for sale on a shopping street near you.
The oversized hats come right after "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60 centimetres wide brim that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation onto the catwalk - a straw beach bag the same size as the bikini-clad model who wore it.
The beach bag, in the color of burnt orange and fringes topped with a white leather handle, was the most obvious part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during fashion week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the fashion stores next summer—the designer has made such an impression that I doubt it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized worship."
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent graduation results, which are only enhanced by individual and joint success in sport, art, music and other community measures.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), work to provide the best services to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, career paths, and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't just lean on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that language is at the top of the league tables with the highest passing grades for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took foreign languages received A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 member schools, show that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital assets, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages as electives are considered equivalent to the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Committee for Employment and Properties in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of employers were struggling to fill positions due to a lack of language skills among applicants.
Therefore, it is more and more important with language in school to prepare the youth for the workplace.
With multiple job opportunities for language savvy, these properties are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have an orderly advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons in 2013, 75 percent could speak no language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language learning for our children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different in terms of the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the UK as we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a plethora of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the properties they need to succeed, whatever the future brings.
It cannot be denied that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "international communication properties."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, thus offering diversity and high skills for Scotland's young.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is soon over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason game on Sunday, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he will play has not been decided yet.
"It's going to be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James will most likely play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season play at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins on a whirlwind of campaigners tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled stops in the coming week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold to choose to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for upcoming midterm elections since Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when votes are due in November.
Where time is Trump going to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely record this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense over allegations of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmation vote from the Senate on hold for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this cavalier of gatherings is to help the Republicans meet the November elections and gain some momentum (drive).
So, President Trump's campaign says that these five gatherings next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control by Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who refused to be briefed to Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the gathering until the evening may bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and features coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the opinion polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a boost in the opinion polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show stomach for battle to keep hope alive on Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup throng.
The swinging pendulum of moments is a completely invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and never more so than in competitions like these.
So where would they say instant is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we'll take that as a small moment , I guess," Jordan Spieth said as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and leads by example.
The guttural screams of the celebration grew louder as his round continued, sinking an important putt to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt who won them the game at 15, was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you that he thinks that the American team is not out of this.
"You've really just got to dig deep and worry about your own struggle," Spieh said.
That's all each of these players has left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but cute couple is four from four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine (the last nine holes of an 18-hole course) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged crowd, cements that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European sliver when the sun sets over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talk of European honour will be even too soon.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did brief work by Sergio Garcia, tomorrow's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, the Spaniard and Swede dug into a hole they never came close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give and the way that a strategy can change at a moment's notice.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is taking a significant lead into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the game that anyone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe take 10-6 lead in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out from Saturday's four-ball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their game so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side stalled to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfired American side tomorrow fourballs, and took the series 3–1.
The United States offered more opposition in foursomes and won two games, but they could not bring in the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from the 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a startling weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opener in four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they then set out handsomely to beat an out-and-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more coveted 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for tomorrow's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – ranked one and three in the world.
Europe still didn't get everything they wanted on a nice windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in the foursomes as they had lost the two holes in the open.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point pad and go into singles, although as holders Furyk's side need only draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, it looks as if a Sunday counter-attack will be outside them.
North Korea says there will be no talk of arming down unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told Saturday to the United Nations that if sanctions continue, distrust of the United States will grow and that it would by no means give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the world government that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to improve conditions over the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled that nuclear test site and do not promise to disperse nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we are not getting anything equivalent back from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri, a noted North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his dissent proved significant in that he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's safety.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted talks to ease tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear decommissioning first" and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose by force, and they even opposed the "declaration to make peace," Ri said.
"The belief that sanctions can crack us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when sanctions continue, our distrust only grows."
Ri did not mention anything about plans for another summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months and added: "If the party in this call to nuclear disarmament was South Korea, and not the United States, the dismantling on the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that there was no way to stop North Korean missiles against the U.S. mainland, after evil-doing President Trump called Kim a rocket man on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, lavished praise on Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea dismantles its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timeframe for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, no matter."
China and Russia claim that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures that have been taken.
However, United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the U.N.'s Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be maintained vigorously and without fail until we get the complete, final, verified decommissioning of the nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to throttle funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemns him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he was seeking were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has helped all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture of studying in caffeine rushes all night, meaning that you use caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
One academic found that students at top universities are often careless when it comes to the very basics—how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a Brigham and Women's Hospital specialist, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I being told this now, in adulthood?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after students got seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, Prof. Czeisler added.
The pride culture of the 24 hours still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough, good quality sleep should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said—even avoiding gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain into a state of starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after being a student with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar program of study before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can completely reset the internal clock, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goals bring down Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another defeat on the road when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's uncovered side to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to take their first on the road since the 4–1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a leader, giving eight points, one round under Ladbrokes leader of the Premier League , Hearts.
Menga batted seven minutes before half-time, and a Ranger lineup with a lack of inspiration never seemed to equalize.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in storage for the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound, after an object seemingly was thrown from the away side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt , on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a lingering shot last week, and he would have been thrilled by the way his well-drilled outfit took the chokehold on his opponents on every shift.
Rangers might have had the ball the most , but Livingston did more with whatever ball they had.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his giant chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the return entry.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third round.
Alfredo Morellos knew firmly that he should have had a penalty on the 20 metre mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the wishes of the Colombian.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute might have been against the playing rules, no one can deny that they fortified it just because of the "shot".
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep deadball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard pretended during the break to trade Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the switch caused an immediate impact when the winger made a gap for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed forward to block.
But Livingstone goes on to outwit the guest team to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending forward long shots on long shots.
Holt's team could have increased their lead at the end, but McGregor succeeded well in preventing Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow made a long post from the corner mark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim to penalty when he clashed with Jacobs, but again Thomson oversaw it.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE ARE RECOVERING ... the day when the one who would become the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific pillar ever since then, the Geiger counter also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the seemingly untruthfully pretended cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms caused by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, now it's bubbling!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to 'see' red cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, and changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers, and then reinject
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced the ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, allowing them to "see" a protein common in many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West commissioned a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA cap, after he guest-starred on the TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was the outcry in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance in which he praised United States President, Donald Trump, and said he would stand down for election in 2020.
After taking his third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great cap, he gave the Democrats a tirade and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with an issue with comedian Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage for West's tirade was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he was having a difficult backstage due to his headgear.
"They bullied me behind the scene.
They said, Don't go out there with that hat on.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sunken seat?" saying that he would "put on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments led to beeping at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed painfully affected, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The entire studio went dead silent."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP AGAINST THE PUBLIC."
But talk show hostess Karen Hunter tweeted that West "pretty simple was just who he is and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe embraces and spews ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we" added ho.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's select medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles often cause young boys to feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "pretty strongly" to address the problem.
"Personally, I am convinced that something has gone wrong with the masculinity." he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continues: 'What is innate and what is it that is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets, what makes young boys feel that they must be this particular side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ends this summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he views his meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so in that way it gave me my future family and my life on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the outcast of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, say health workers.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the amount of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/LGBTQ people is claimed to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values in the country, studies have tallied that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that adding lac information from GOP senator, it explodes into 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
United States Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were pedalled by "extreme-right wing" surveys and Web sites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information included informational home addresses and phone numbers of Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the charges of sexual assault of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and released the information to a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continues.
"One of my employees – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these unsubstantiated and false claims – was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They must not question the motives of the culprit.
They need to be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer was found to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being seemingly too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate attempting to take Waters' place in the midterm election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the proper government and law enforcement units of these false allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my co-workers."
Johnny English strikes again - spy nonsense by weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit oddities in every new film with a British angle, and it seems applicable to this revival of Johnny England's action-comedy spoof franchise – which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-deprecating satire about how openly wretched we are become the new export opportunity in the country?
At any rate, the big-eyed, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been given a second-time renewal of his license to fuck things up—his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comedic creation for cinematographers in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the foolish, secret agent who, despite his bizarre desires to spread a little glamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of that guy contributing a simple tune to the Fire Chariots, themed during the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, which left chaos in the aftermath.
There are one or two fine moments in this last JE outing.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades strike his helmet.
Atkinson's go-to physical comedy is on-screen, but the humor feels quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children instead of adults, and to me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's lineclause nonsense in the person of Bean.
The permanent current preoccupation now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, uncovering the identities of every agent Britain has on the scene, to the dismay of the agent at work - an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and war-torn figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there's not much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every active spy has been charged, she must bring in someone who is retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment , but gives unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of nice jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for spying.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved over to a submariner job, an overenthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things go terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Services is back in full swing in the face of Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the enchantment of charismatic technology billionaire, who claims that he can solve Britain's computer problem: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce-like wild game: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves aboard Volta's yacht; and English triggers sheer anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
I'm sure all the stops have been pulled out for the final sequence, but as gracious and undisciplined as it is, there's quite a lot of children's TV all over the place.
Pretty moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talents?
Labour denies they are working out a plan for the English to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but be paid for five.
The party, according to the report, wants corporate executives to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, by giving them an extra day off.
Then the employee would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same reward.
Sources said the idea would "fit" with the economic agenda of the party and plans to increase benefits for employees.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
An older Labour source told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a desire that fits into the approach the party has to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as superimposed to the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 campaign.
However, the ambition is not, for the moment, endorsed by the entire Labour party.
A Labour party spokesman said: 'A four-day work week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labor Conference to enhance his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was firmly determined to reclaim power from "faceless executives" and "profiteers" of wealthy businesses.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies cannot recover their full efforts when a Labor government could make "deductions" due to perceived misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and created Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 percent of the equity in private sector enterprises to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500, approximately $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the TV program "60 Minutes" about the FBI s in investigating Kavanaugh could make them change their thoughts
The FBI investigation into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of the extent to which the agency's finding could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley of "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could uncover anything that would cause them to rethink.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on my way into the hearing, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done that?'
He was determined, firmly determined, unequivocal."
Graham’s voice, however, seemed set in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite allegation to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vehemently," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she names couldn't confirm that.
That's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a hugely impressive lineup of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; bringing an end to poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's grand lawn, to not only enjoy watching Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to increase awareness for the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering; emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help increase awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feel like they're making a genuine difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, and participated in and pushed on a variety of targets.
It says these actions have helped enable world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential"; promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," - the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after they took more than 5,000 actions to demand that Britain improve on nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, they ask, "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the actors performing at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Fleet as "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East, is that they want to convey energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he was quoted as saying.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has this ability, with our Fleet, to make sure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that presents itself as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
"The economic solution to Iran and Russia is more or less to utilize and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
In doing so, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's ardent opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the position that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has drawn backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would take a "thorough look" at running for president after the midterm election.
During a council house meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider thoroughly running for president."
Warren addressed President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been harsh in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, an opinion poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run for office in 2020.
51 percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the Senator should not run as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other families who are suffering from PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and airmen and every other military, have done for the country, exists".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with physical violence in the home against a woman, for interfering with a report of domestic violence and the safekeeping of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts in Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions fits the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the select gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States that support Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large amount of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations face pervasive problems with gangs and violence in the home.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration law, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing violence in their home, to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum cases be judged on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle is contrary to this principle," said the friend-of-the-court brief.
Lawyers further asserted in the summary that the policy denying immigrants access harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "offers necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate every problem—even every serious problem—that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever-stricken baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city, Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find."
Residents are observed returning to their destroyed homes, searching through water-damaged properties and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had fractured back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes while he told me he felt the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the rubble of the wall, I think, "Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe."
US ambassador blames China for "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in a US daily and highlighted the mutual benefits of trade with the US and China, the US ambassador against China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid endorsements in the Des Moines Register—the state Iowa's largest sales paper—after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has seen them in turns raise taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to match exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines registry, “is now doubling the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
"In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will see no true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party "screed him.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers turned off the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which one.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns Analyst.
As many top Republicans are standby and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple charges of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will likely see a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already wanted to move forward with a voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) last-minute pressure for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants chanted "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who chair the Judiciary Committee, chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it can get higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault directed at appointed Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed ahead with the confirmation.
"This has been a confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh has been put on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that contributes to electing Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
But Americans seem to be a little bit split over who to believe in in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more siding with the latter.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and also at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the law enforcement committee of the Senate under oath last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals while attending a party during the time they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data repository" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process, and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some contracted developers, as well as a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about not enacting a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new online collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of great influence in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era online," Berners-Lee added ten l.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divinely celebrated
The only Church of England divine to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter, has been celebrated in his home town 100 years afterwards.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann won the prize on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic", that the stone would be unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick shutter and under heavy fire from fields and machine guns."
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "greatest gallantry" brought the line forward before alone rushing forward with a field rifle and knocking out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm audacious about."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, adding that "the value of a true hero is shown by the support given by many people."
MMA fans were up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a packed Bellator 206 but then you don't get to see the main event.
The bill from San Jose contained 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare to meet each other, viewers in Britain were again stunned when coverage changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter described switching to the children's comics as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's public regulation that at 6 a.m. if the contents weren't owned that way, then they had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
"Peppa pig, "yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will be working on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about replay, I think that we can probably figure it out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday, and we won't find out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it passed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it's not going to happen.
We keep it to five games instead of six—as we usually do—and we tried to hand it over to the fans, and we just went over.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that growing up he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disks presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter of the cross-country shows, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
What might look like a lost out in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt "less than" anyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "Until today, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different has been the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a professional LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age"—he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later—he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his entire "his" perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about whether I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his dad did not accept his death and one of the last things he had asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 - when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be on the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I'd been dreaming about my whole life - diving in in front of a home audience at an Olympic Games, where fans had no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud of Heather Small – which had vibrated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape, Mickelson sits on the bench at the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must turn his form around to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk ahead of Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game within range for the hope of correcting what plagues him.
Never the most competent long shot. Not even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting with the long shot on the narrow, main French course, where balls hit outside if the golfer is not accurate with the shots.
And if the track itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will meet in the ninth game on Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 singles games, make it to a warm start, Mickelson's game may be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, not that he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I don't think I thought he played two games.
I envisioned more, but that's what it was like, and that's what we thought we had to do.
He'll be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 carries, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his proximity added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to keep fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun getting a game with him as well, this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes a lot more than just playing."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead heading into the latter-day singles of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with his nose leading by the narrowest margins, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but barely," said Bjørn, after he had seen Klassa 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
You go to full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've been saying all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's going on on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Happy at how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never take the lead on advances.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that will emerge, and that is another thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there individually, you’re being tested to the fullest of your capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner, and he has to go and get the best out of himself, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be on the lookout for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the turnarounds on the big last few days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before quitting as a loser when Europe left the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every fucking word of that," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players heading into the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get on with the quick start that you saw on Brookline, that you saw on Medinah.
When that moment is allowed to go a way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our line-up accordingly and set the boys going in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow" .
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the match and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," Bjorn said of his choices of singles.
Germany's new warship launched once again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging Cold War era warships, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and scolding costs, local media reported.
Commencement of Rhineland-Pfalz, the leadership of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel was to have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships the Navy ordered back in 2007, come as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home.
Yet continuous delays mean that the ground-breaking warships, which supposedly allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already become outdated when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to receive the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware errors" that rendered the warship useless if deployed on a combat task.
Software errors were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half the labour of older Bremen frigates.
The ship was also found to be dramatically overweight, reducing performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the price of the entire project - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the newest frigates, become particularly important in light of the latest warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the fleet is in fact "nearly running out of distribution-competent ships".
The officer said that the problem has built on itself over time, because old ships were discontinued, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats
New research being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles and also brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, natural science advisor to the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat, natural homes, are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management efforts such as the acquisition of meadows and how it is best to maintain woodland for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting rest areas and habitat/bus sites loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find errors and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, sleep site inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underscores the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within property, since it is possible that endless destruction of a single dwelling can kill up to 400 female bats and young, and perhaps wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are faring."
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges in what lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labelled the rape charges against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to highlight themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers just hours after the charges, that the charges are "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says the five-time Gold Ball winner into the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be known to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good, "the player added and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy," according to Reuters
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek damages for "moral harm in an amount that stands to the severity of the rule violation , which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where it is claimed that he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the supposed incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failing by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an equalization because she felt "scared of retaliation" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to switch places as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever undo' losing automakers
Britain "would undo that forever" if it lost its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "if" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the effect of border delays in the event of a non-agreement Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – as do Toyota's Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My perception is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stoppages at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director of Burnaston.
Other British automakers have raised fears of leaving the EU with no agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what automakers say is supply chain risk in the event of a non-agreement Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border that the industry says could cause delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "just calibrated to avoid the checks at the border."
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's daily programme.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that extra costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the facility, said that his members are more concerned: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "squeezed back a week" as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will say up the general to the prosecutors, thereby endangering Mueller's self-defense, has fueled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing a lease to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the UN in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who has charged him with sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying full voting by the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “No date has been set; it may be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be delayed another week because of everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters will probably disagree: Sanders has not held a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to a dissatisfaction with TV reporters' play for the gallery, although she did say: "I'm not disingenuous that they do."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The president is holding more press conferences than any president has done before," she said—rightly without providing evidence for the claim. "We've been looking at the numbers."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the press gets a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it that way a lot, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press briefing if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly welcomes questions as he departs the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the President to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the President perhaps demonstrated why, performing before the reporters without shame, and almost bizarrely.
Health secretary writes about Brexit fears of EU workers on NHS in Scotland
The health secretary has written to EU workers working on the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter although there are less than six months left before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to shoulder the costs of applications that have the status of settled for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations regarding withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and it is approaching its expected conclusion this fall.
Yet the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I know that this will be a difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work in the health sector and are beneficial for patients and society.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays for the Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury when the team lost 31–27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee State head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred right before the break.
"He came to the sidelines and collapsed, sort of," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to the back for further evaluation.
An official Tennessee State spokesman, told WSMV that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt medical center.
There are no details on the extent of the injury yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is in his second year at university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before becoming injured in Saturday's game, and is now up to 18 overall this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be added for those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who earn a lot, with the promise of offering affordable housing.
The increase in stamp duty will be added for individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money should strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of vagrants.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current stamp duty, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago at second residence and rental residences, may be at as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the decision to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13 per cent of new buildings in London are bought by residents outside the UK, which means that prices will be higher, and it will be more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He indicted large construction firms for keeping prices up by obtaining property but not using it, and asked Theresa May to give up quotas on reasonable housing to fix Britain's "residential shame".
Corbyn has announced a series of conspicuous proposals for housing reforms, including controlled hiring and the ending of expulsions for no reason.
He will and give the councils greater power to build new settlements.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
That means fixing the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Yet it cannot be right that it should be as easy for individuals not living in the UK, or foreign firms, to buy housing as it is for hardworking, British residents.
For many people, the dream of their own home has fallen too far away, and the humiliation of being wanderers is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate ambition" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scotsman (42) are looking forward to the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. For now, they are in third place in League One, just three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish major leagues in the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B national team match, and that was it," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hamden with my father, and there's always been something that's pulled me back.
That possibility can only come if I am successful as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager, include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I 'can get this club back into the Premier League.'
In view of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only see myself as successful if I manage to get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to get from relegation to the third level, transforming St Mirren, who was on his way to move down, into the title winner of the championship series for the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did when he was a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was another roadblock," he says of leading Alloa.
"I genuinely believed that being a manager suited me much better than being a player.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well, lit up well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you're left to get through each week.
I still notice that when it comes to the stress and pressure of the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable thing I've ever felt in my own body in my entire adult life."

Survey shows that the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday
This summer's heat wave has led to an increase in the earnings of struggling pubs in the UK, but and increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales increased by 2.7 per cent in the bar industry - but for the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 per cent, according to the statistics.
Business adviser Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "The sustained sun, and the fact that England were in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern for June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder hit.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant business only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks, did markedly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food, gained and felt the decline of the sun, although not as dramatic as that of restaurant owners.
It may seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking hall had increased by 6.6 per cent this month, while food had declined three per cent.
Paul Newman, travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sporting event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the nightlife business.
It is no surprise that the restaurant business will continue to struggle; a 4.8 per cent annual decline in sales would be hard to come by on top of a falling cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for food operators. Time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a much-anticipated respite."
The total sales increase across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the taper in the release of brands.

One in five children have secret social media profiles that they hide from their parents
One in five children—some as young as 11—have secret social media profiles that they hide from parents and teachers, a survey shows
Survey of 20,000 high school students reveals an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has increased fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head" profile they show their parents
One in five children—some as young as 11—make social media profiles that they keep secret from adults.
A survey among 20,000 high school students revealed a sharp increase in "false Insta" profiles - a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing platform.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while also having private profiles.
A mother who stumbled across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "choose me".
The research, undertaken by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in various schools, found that 40 per cent of those between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes 'athlete's voice' on the Scottish athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish athletics board as non-administrative director at the board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland, and chairman Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the UK and the world's athletics community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland can benefit from getting it into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am keen to serve as a voice for coaches, and I hope I can be part of contributing and helping the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both the 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his total four Olympic golds and is now a regular guest of the BBC, was unable to go after a drip.
On Twitter, he wrote: "Today it's a month since I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could tell me if I was going to get well again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing flexibility showers!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Divided opinions on the Internet about breast pump advertising comparing mothers to milk cows
A breast pump company has split public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to milk cows.
To mark what has been described as "the world's first silent sitting breast pump", technology company Elvie released a cheeky advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives mothers extracting milk.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "In case you didn't notice, this isn't teats, it's my tits."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
The ad, published on the company's Facebook page, however, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the "horror" of the dairy industry.
<0xC2><0xBB>Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that the calves are stolen from them just days after birth," one writes.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic enough for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"
Another added: "What a violence-removed advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement, and one lady admitted that she thinks the song is "funny."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd have one if I were still a grandmother.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
This commercial is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement bragging about or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump wrapped in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and sits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product, that it deserves a daring and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers extracting milk and milk cows, we wanted to put the spotlight on breast pumping and challenges associated with it, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved in silence to tent camp on Texas border
The number of imprisoned immigrant children has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the strict policies the Trump administration has imposed making it more difficult to place the children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that coming forward and welcoming a child may threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of that increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members will be left to submit fingerprints, and that this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement testified before Congress and said that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to sponsor single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on their record already.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are criminal aliens.
So we're going to continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
According to camp staff, new rules have now been introduced to deal with the children, requiring some of them to go to court before a month has passed, as opposed to 60 days previously.
Many will participate via video calls and not by personal attendance, to have their case tried before an immigration judge.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely it is that they develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, the camp staff says.
Proponents say these concerns are greater at large facilities such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the facility, signs of children's toil are more likely to be overlooked.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or saying the hate to friends, can reinforce trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is now at war on the eighth year.
Moualem, who and serves as deputy prime minister, said that emerging forces are occupying Syrian soil illegally on the pretext of defeating terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without preconditions," he told the audience.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight a holy battle until all Syrian territories have been cleansed" of both terrorist groups and the "illegal presence of foreigners."
The United States has roughly 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
Speaking of the refugee problem, Moualem said it was safe for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for having "spread irrational fears" about the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They are making politics out of something that should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The US and EU have warned that there will be no help in bringing about reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
U.N. diplomats say a recently created agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major rebel stronghold, has created a possibility to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a major attack by Russian-backed, Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem underlined that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Nusra Front, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria, paving the way for the election.
Moualem stipulates conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution," and warned of disruption.
Why Trump is going to win another term
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 re-election if not, as many liberal viewers likely hope, the presidency comes to an early end due to scandals and impeachment.
It would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic ending to a presidency ever!"
At the time of writing, there is no sign that viewers have gotten bored.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its primetime ratings to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled its to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has lagged at the top of its cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers on nights of big news.
"This is a fire that people are lured by, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a ride in a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why so? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied according to Scovell.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the history that comes from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families are allowed to be together again and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself at the sixth hour to watch a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep backgrounds" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather bomber jacket ("a garment thick of arrogance," the Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' uncanny, uncanny writing.
Personally, I'm never going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily lead at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about that show that goes on with Trump's employees and daily disputes (go into a fight with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you won't hang on anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sunny outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to sway away, not when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the densest inter-election battle
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a realignment of the districts in Congress that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The recently converted suburban district of Pittsburg promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring of last year.
Lamb is fighting another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently a representative in the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were illegally formed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has launched a gun draw for funding the campaigns, between the major parties' money arsenal, the Democratic Congressional Committee, and the Republican Congressional Committee.
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a narrow advantage.
The U.S. was considering punishing El Salvador over its support for China, but withdrew.
Diplomats remarked that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump organization's leadership team.
The secretaries of state decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry spokeswoman, in a statement early this month.
But punishment was considered only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development, and financial aid.
The purported penalties, which contained cuts to financial aid and targeted restrictions in terms of visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, and so put a stop to the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will be meeting the conference, which has been scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the relevance the administration is putting on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the pretext of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the administration and also spoke under the guise of anonymity.
Studying History
A wait for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller reportedly turned the focus of the investigation toward whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia idea attacks on our election.
If Congress were to switch managers, Trump would have to stand trial in this body, preparing to overturn voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There is a lot of “what if” and I don’t mean to imply that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterpart in Europe.
There are choices to make for all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the struggle can be.
In 1938, German officers became ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, only the West had resisted him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage this entailed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or postponed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water ever since this paper revealed that last year he proposed to wiretap the president in secret, speculating that he is unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we in the midterms vote for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I think we don't fail, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off to light Sabbath candles on the table praying the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be an optimist in terms of the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the braces over the Australians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2–2 result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it at the end, but all in all, a draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday, it will be yet another great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, they got a good result in their last game, but with the crowd behind us I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now everything feels good.
The stables are good and the boys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over This Fear About Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be cared for, few talked to family members about it.
Approximately half of those who participated in a survey from the Nationwide insurance company said they spoke to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
This is where you start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not make your wishes known well in advance.
Work with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since these options can be a big part of determining costs.
Bring in a financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
The long-term care financing options can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value life insurance policy to help pay the expenses, or you insuring yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Prepare legal documents: Avert legal battles before they start.
Get a health authorization in place so that you designate a person you trust to oversee your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You may also consider a warrant for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and ensure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer any questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you are ready.
"It's not just the finances it's about, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medication is it?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in what he was returning home after a trip to the city.
The victim in his 40s was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police constables describe the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. local time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are requesting witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public officials say. The number of dead is expected to increase.
Without the ability to communicate, aid workers have received no information from Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake which had a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area extending over more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstay of the economy of central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated to Morowali, across Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Ring of Fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major tremors and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major quake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom in Aceh.
2005: A series of large quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake struck the south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that crashed onto the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of approximately 10 metres which destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small quake hit the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the 2004 quake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings collapsing.
2018: Major quakes hit the tourist island of Lombok killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor of Alaska and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involvement in reporting domestic violence and opposing arrest.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the offences.
Palin is being remanded in Mat-Su prison, and is being held on bail $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when asked, the network stated.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and face $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with something criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the attack.
The case is up in the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault in the home, involvement in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had alleged that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming from when he served in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds lost their lives
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the numbers of fatalities are expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake hit just outside the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment where the quake hits are rampant on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want rare death penalty for New York terror suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal offense in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October, driving down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov murdered the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" inflicted serious, bodily harm on them, according to a memo filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these incidents could underlie a possible death penalty, the court document states.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 charges, including eight charges of murder targeting extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in the context of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "essential planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "disgusting, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the memo states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York has sentenced the death penalty in a case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done felt good, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on the phone, the prosecution says.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "clearly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong trauma from the incident for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Tory MP believes Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiators
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today, during a protest at the Tory convention.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians had to “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, opinionated Member of Parliament Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain "had been out" by now, if Farage was Brexit minister.
With the challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply split ranks has been underscored by a separate protest in the city, held by the Tories who wish to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep the plan with the Chequers compromise on track after attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers as well as the EU.
Allies insist she will push for a deal with Brussels, despite the backlash – forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone told the Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihull that he wants to "reject Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should be given noble rank and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had steered, we would be out by now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP, added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subservient.
We will make our own laws in our own country".
Bone rejects the claim that the meaning of the people has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false".
Tory Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and have us elected in the first place.
Please, drop Chequers and listen up"
In a message directed at May, she adds: "Ministers of State keep their jobs when they keep what they promise".
Farage said police officers must be allowed to "feel the heat" should they come to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that 'we are not going to let them get away with it'."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to make the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilising the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.
Simultaneously, the Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the centre.
A handful of activists waved the "Tories Against Brexit" banner after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take a "close look" at running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a close look at running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusett spoke about his future during a town meeting in the west of Massachusett Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but a board member of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of much speculation that she may want to try against Trump in 2020.
The incident in Holyoke on Saturday, was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump took office.
One contestant asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time "for women to make the trip to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest made in shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the case where Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player, Wayde Sims, was shot and killed Friday.
At 11:00 a.m. local time, police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen on the video clip.
Sims (20) was shot and killed early Friday on the university's southern grounds.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result of it," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, writing 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In interrogation, Simpson has admitted that he was on the scene, with a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the police department in eastern Baton Rouge.
A third-year student of nearly two meters, raised in Baton Rouge. Sims played 32 games, ten of them from the start of the previous season, where he averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 returns in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world title after team orders give sway over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders from Mercedes would have a major role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start to the race, allowing Hamilton to take care of himself in defending his position for the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and allowed Hamilton to enter traffic at the back of the course, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes drove into the depot one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ended up in front after a bit of action side-by-side which forced the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the inside in danger of not being able to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, in the back row and dropped to seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of driving past Kimi Raikkonen who was fourth.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase his speed in the final eight rounds while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election rally Saturday due to her insistence that she not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she indicts High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
During a speech at an election rally in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given the Senate Commission directly, but rather commented that what goes on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and horrible and spoke falsely".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and uncomfortable and speaking falsely," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then you say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember you?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do that?
Do you remember her answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, er, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn't lay it."
Wait a moment.
No, we didn't leak it," he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her refusal did not fall on good soil with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election rally: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with bad sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
"They are determined to reclaim power in any way they see necessary.
You see the cruelty, the horror, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control," the president said according to Mediaite.
Premier League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee stars compensated for their loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return game 5–3 on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-goal lead due to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized before Dwyer once again sent the Giants into the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the boys of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, where the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier which doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan won the home team back into the game in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt provided for Cownie's equaliser in the 16th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants brought the lead into the pause as he scored his second goal for the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again provided an equaliser with a beaming goal after 27 minutes played.
Late in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen acquire Dundee's lead for the first time in the game. He, on the other hand, secured the victory with the fifth goal for the team halfway through the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home in the next game, which is on Friday.
Air traffic controller loses life to ensure hundreds in plane escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers made it safely into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disturb the area, and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even though it swung wildly.
He stayed behind to make sure that the plane on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He next jumped down from the control tower believing it collapsed.
He later died at the hospital.
The Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a major hospital in a major city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of casualties will increase to thousands, while the country's emergency relief agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of dead is increasing while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we can't reach," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to 20 feet have destroyed Palu, which is scheduled to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Emergency aid is coming in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
The small shops have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross are struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military In the country: "I ask you all to work around the clock to do everything you can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini reports man missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline that operated an aircraft that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean reports that a man is slowed down, having stated earlier that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that as of Saturday afternoon, they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it attempted to land at the Chuuk island airport.
Authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane was flying past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to wade through the water, which raised them up to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew were panicking and screaming, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said nearby sailors, working to improve a berth, also rescued passengers with a rubber dinghy that they used to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank at about 100 feet.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG registered airlines' aircraft in the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analyst creates timeline overnight as woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented all evidence on Saturday during the appealed trial of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he pieced together recordings from cell phones to find out what happened the night Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett told me he used location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, in contrast to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone at the same time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecution asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of her death.
But their cell phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted messages, calls and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is to close the case on Sunday.
The judge said that he expects the trial to go to the jury later the same day.

Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple for firing after 'racist' text message
A babysitter in New York City is suing a couple to fire her based on discrimination after she received a misdirected text message from her mother complaining that she was "yet another black person."
The couple have denied that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was unhappy when she saw that the babysitter she had hired, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, ONLY ONE BLACK PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent him to Maurice, her babysitter, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the unfit Plasco-Flaxman fired the babysitter Maurice, saying that the previous babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for firing her. She wants $350 a day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was without a contract, where she would live with her family.
"I want to show them that it's not okay to do that," she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know that's discrimination."
The couple have denied that they are racist, saying that firing Maurice was the only thing they could do after insulting her, because they were afraid that she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," her husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've offended look after your children, even if you didn't mean to offend them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion," saying his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to go after a person in a situation like that?
It's not a nice thing to do," said investor Plasco.
As the case is going on, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher of the Paddington books was afraid that people would not like a talking bear, reveals new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's very fun to know now how successful Paddington became."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected.She added that she had mixed feelings during the book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, which she described as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was proud on the inside of how successful he was.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never boasted," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you get proud of them even if it's not really you who's behind it.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in haste, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'm coming soon to be with you.
I'll be there soon.
The medications doctors had given her for her heart to continue pumping were slowly coming out of her system.
She had already died and now her body was turning itself off.
I was just sitting there, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't howl or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she had just gone through.
"Nobody knew anything," she said.
"I sat with my head bowed while tears fell."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women hang patches on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached patches on a bridge in Wales designed to inspire and make people thinking about committing suicide change their minds and call the numbers on the patches.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began struggling with depression and killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day."
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a talented chef with a smile that forged.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile brightened up every room."
But before he died, he quit his job, because he was in a "really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said: "I'm still concerned that the little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "to let people know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone – you need to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been Davis's friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that he was starting to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts he didn't even look at them."
She told us that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continue to work through the trauma: "There's a big void in our family now.
We're completely broken.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs by a thin thread as the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he's asking about – a limited investigation – then maybe we could achieve a little solitude," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he's afraid the committee is "collapsing" in the middle of a partisan backlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The midterm elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans are not doing well, this will make it difficult for them to elect Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley that way, then has been Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're going to run in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, and with 50 votes, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, will be able to give him the last vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea "goes down" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawmaker
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, saying that there were 1,127 defectors last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons the number has dropped.
Pyongyang has not spoken out publicly.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea gain South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, often sending them back by force.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are technically still at war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks come after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean foreign ministers accused Ri Yong-ho of not achieving anything since then.
"Without being able to rely on the United States, we cannot rely on our country being safe, and in such a situation, we cannot disarm our weapons first," said Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he cannot serve on the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too great a temper to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she'd have been called "hysterical," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate judge's chair on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied any charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and cried at times with a lump in his throat as he recounted his family and years of high school.
He criticized the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and a planned assassination on his reputation," organized by liberal police officers angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he cannot serve on the Supreme Court, because it shows he is prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think the way he behaved disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made an objection when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this—if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he can't serve on the Supreme Court, nor in the court he serves now," Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington, D.C.'s Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about potential Kavanaugh convictions against the law known as Obamacare and the matter of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions in the High Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great," Pelosi said.
And women must wield the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you think?"
She continues, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high company position, who said that she was branching when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she was branching, "You might think I'm sorry because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just goes on.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears serve as a way to get the mind out, but that is what many people misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I was branching out of anger, and a woman older than me grabbed me by the neck – she was a cold leader that I had always been terrified of – and dragged me out into the hallway.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry and that they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a Congresswoman, a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught cheating on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she might as well run for president herself.
"I hadn't really thought it through well enough," she said to me as she laughed, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""
Since the campaign had already been going on for a while, it had not raised enough money, so it promised that it would only run if it was able to raise $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she wasn't going to run anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and aim at the voters instead of the delegates, and anger at the gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
"You should have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said of how the press reacted when it branched.
"You should have thought that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"She branch"?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle continues, a rift between the two countries could be a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump shelled first shot of this year taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has retaliated, setting tariffs of between five and ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States for every shoe they fire, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to end with the first.
To get Washington to stop, China has to do what the US wants, but bowing to the US is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the U.S. pressure could have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by decreasing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing may cause both economies to go under is more dangerous than people have dared to admit in the past," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and calls for help to rebuild the country destroyed after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terror," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal areas.
All preconditions are now in place for refugees to be able to return voluntarily to the country in which they may travel from due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that compromised their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government is likely to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they are not going to accept assistance or help with terms from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown in the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team, reaching the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson struggled most of the tournament, hitting the ball into the water from the tee at hole 16, par 3, giving it to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari did well in all of his rounds and became one of four players who have ever received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European with 25.5 points in his career.
"Usually I didn't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
How grateful that Thomas chose me and believes in me.
I'm so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He makes the relay stick on to fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2–1 in single play on Sunday.
"I feel a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I woke up watching him," Rahm (23) said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a 13–21–3 Ryder Cup record through his career.
A remarkable statistic from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 major titles and is only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, spoke out after a disappointing showing from his team. "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a one-of-a-kind captain
All 12 of his players played very well.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to take your hat off.
We got roundplayed."
