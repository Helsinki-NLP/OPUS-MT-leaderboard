Politicians in Wales afraid to "look like fools"
There was dismay among some members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from the MWP to the Muppet (fool).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a bill introducing the name changes, said: "The final decision on denominations that members of parliament will be given is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to suggest alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the chairman of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The bill on the reforms includes other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what to call them when the bill is debated.
Macedonians vote to change country's name
Voters on Sunday will vote on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim to Greek territory and has long protested Macedonia's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said he would reject the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a price paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's go silent as the churches of Harlem fight
“The elderly people I have spoken to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Today, there are none of those things.”
He said it is understandable that the bars are disappearing.
“People are socializing in other ways these days,” he said.
“Bars no longer make up the living rooms of the neighborhood, where people walk in on a daily basis.”
In relation to churches, he worries that the money raised on selling assets doesn’t last long and that they “sooner or later are back where they started”.
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes full of the kind of people who don’t help the neighborhood’s returning sanctuaries.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white,” he says, “and that further fuels the trend where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the condominiums will become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had served nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, which would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to restore the building, they ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson of St. Martin's, proudly called the chimes "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the glockenspiel in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first glockenspiel in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger glockenspiel in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not find a replacement for him.
What has played out in St. Martin’s over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and entrepreneurs, some of them caught up with by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The parish council – the parish’s leading body, which consists of leading laymen – wrote in July to the diocese about concerns that the diocese “would try to push the expenses further” to the parish council, even though the parish council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent in.
Some of the parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old on Diving Trip for Lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy Saturday as he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then, along with a group, paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just enthusiasm to have caught a lobster, but then he realized the boy was shouting, "I got bitten!
I was bitten!”
"His whole collarbone was torn open," said Hammel, as he approached the boy.
"I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It is not known what species of shark attacked.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with ranges of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to capture the UK beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion and home products decline, the larger ranges of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in more stores next year if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products is happening as supermarkets are looking for new items for shelves previously used for televisions, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury's says it is doubling its range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in the style of those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching the range of Boutique make-up, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing stalls in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a move towards sourcing small amounts of food daily at local grocery stores means supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said the stores will look like department stores as the supermarket chain takes on Aldi and Lidl by introducing more non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These initiatives have strengthened their grocery sales and have made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint approach with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended in an argument about how to distribute the profits from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmacy chain to Celesio, which owns Lloyd’s Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have changed the look and layout of our lines of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the engaging environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "outraged" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulls from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their residential product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones enraged after she pulled out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “outraged” when, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the popular TV woman said her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of her vacation rentals.
A source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she had to deal with for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
Nobody would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the headquarters in Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement by the This Morning host, who is among the UK’s highest-earning stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in products – everything from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in the launch.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughbys and her husband Dan Baldwin has had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, took office as chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business actions."
Tough talk, "and then we fell in love"
He made fun of the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment that “is not worthy of a president” and for being so positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody of a news host.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim is interested in a meeting more after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Talks on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "similar response" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial moves against disarmament.
He noted that the United States is instead continuing with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure going.
Trump took a more optimistic view in the speech at his electorate meeting.
“North Korea is doing very well,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results – the end of rocket tests, help with the release of hostages and the repatriation of remains from US military men.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake ravage island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were homeless, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international relief.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it has been clear that they are not requesting international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Because of the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly exposed, the country is very ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami havens have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning had been issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunami siren is missing, and this has probably affected the death toll.
Even in the best of conditions, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s inadequate infrastructure a key point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in the run-up to the election next year.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge settles in last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, while his team was 1-0 down.
He pricked the ball with his left foot before making a high shot to the far post.
The ball flew high over the field towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was just a matter of getting in the position, getting the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came, and I made a single touch. I didn't think much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea striker returned his heel to Mateo Kovacic before speeding up in midfield and sprinting into Liverpool’s half of the pitch.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in midfield.
He then made a long pass that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defence and finished against the far post with a left-footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster response agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that fell after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit Friday, creating waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7.55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called on people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Police Assistant Commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also encourage anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with dashcam, to contact us, as they may have information that may be crucial to the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman arrived on the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but is told by police that no one may enter the building.
He was stunned when he heard what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She kept saying, “It’s so awful.”
At 2 p.m., there were two police cars inside the cordon and another car just outside.
A number of police officers stood within the cordon and monitored the apartment complex.
Anyone with information is asked to write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and provide log 247 on September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by discussion of 'rewriting history'
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical, puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the context of the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The Great Picture Storm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still think is worth paying tribute to.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate depiction is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and remembrance."
Dr<0xC3><0xA6>bergris attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a torn artery and smeared with blood near a pigsty at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farm is preparing to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The following morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pigsty next door was open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a big boar with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and injured,” said the cousin, who goes by the surname “Wu,” in a quote from the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police were gathering evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there have been cases of pigs attacking humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kg pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor, until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs aren’t usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
"They're just playful.
They pluck, they're very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
“You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring heavy rain in much of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
Rosa, however, will bring heavy rains with flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. on Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 254mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure drain coming closer, creating heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm surges, liquid fallout and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storm surges with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rains.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into roaring rivers and thunder will create strong local winds and create dust.<0x3C>/seg>
The approaching low-pressure storm will bring heavy rain along the coast in parts of Southern California.
There is a risk of a total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which can result in small amounts of liquid fallout and slippery roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets cooler, but it remains reasonably warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern areas.<0x3C>/seg>
It can get up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate outlook indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 Million Watched the Hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw poignant testimony Thursday from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political battle continued with stations interrupting regular programming to tell of Friday’s late-night developments: an agreement brokered by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona that allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, groped her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it Friday.
The company tallied average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available ratings from other stations showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people watch programs in offices.
To put that in perspective, it’s a ratings figure that corresponds to a game during the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-based hosts have strongly backed the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, as protesters yelled at him as he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stared down for several minutes while being scolded and CNN broadcast live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and said before the elevator closed, he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All of the television stations covered live coverage a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on whether or not Kavanaugh's nomination should go on to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would vote in favor only under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee in the following week, which Democrats, who are outnumbered in the Senate, had sought.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had an impact because it was clear that Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
UK PM accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside Theresa May on the front page of the paper, her former secretary of state Boris Johnson made his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of being behind the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on suspicion of negligent homicide, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to the Wayde shooting.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot wound that went from head to neck.
Police said a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, Southern University police and local residents assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked police in the area for their "care and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "broken" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"It's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity erupted in the crater, and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded over the course of 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumble and tremors over several rounds.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the richter scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters seeking independence clashed with riot police as thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked separatists held riot policemen back, threw and powder-painted, creating dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also fights later in the day when police used their batons to keep the fighting down.
For several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and were met by unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
14 people received treatment for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 vote, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low, and those opposed to secession boycotted the vote on a large scale.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the holding of the vote during violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups had camped the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dares hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although they won a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved into exile themselves or are in detention awaiting trial for their role in the holding of the vote and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of the police, saying the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"The nomination as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the setback in democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
There may also have been a crossbow fired at the car at some point.
Shots from Menga give Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston secured the victory
Livingston surprised Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s team has not won away from home this season and will face the leading Hearts team, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
The Rangers will be joined by Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, extend their undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not suffered a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash away
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their direct style of play created major problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but passed across in front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the goal, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's transverse header in front of the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the away team problems in dead-ball situations.
And it was under these conditions that the important goal came.
The Rangers took a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson creating the pitch for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unchallenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was deflected with the feet by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's dead-ball situations.
Passings entered Livingston’s field on a regular basis, but were averted, and two penalty claims – following Halkett’s tackling on substitute Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastic and exceeded expectations on their upward journey.
Their style of play and squad is largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
“They’ve been really good under Gerrard at times, but they played below level.
Their finishes lacked sharpness – only once did they expose the home team – and that’s a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disagreements have arisen in areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's rapprochement with the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters turned up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents – many of them Kurdish – also took note of and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of the city around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and there were rescuers at the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the scene on Childers Street, about one mile (1.6 km) from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been rerouted and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured During Riots
Six officers have been injured in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was unrest in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 a.m. BST on Sunday, and the unrest is still going on.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the riots involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Especially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing riots in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may end up spending more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot police officers were summoned to prison to deal with serious riots in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm surge (dry areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to strike Arizona, but it most likely will happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern United States, creating a risk of storm surge.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm surge warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones had retained tropical storm or low-pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102mm of rain with isolated amounts up to 152mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas in the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to gain 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storm surge, Rosa’s rain can be a boon because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will be beneficial because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.<0x3C>/seg>
According to the U.S. Drought Watch, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, the second-highest category,” reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.<0x3C>/seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore declines in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains over parts of Mexico can become heavy and cause a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected on a total of 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The primary anticipated hazard from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora, and the U.S.'s southwestern desert area," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
The rains are expected to create life-threatening storm surges and liquid fallout in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police have urged anyone who may have mobile phone records of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh succumbed to the Democratic Party’s “evil and anger”
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the reckless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been subject to the “evil, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, denying strong and emotional allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote for confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most capable legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a great past in public service,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republicans showing up at the polls in the midterm elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices of our lifetime will be.
You can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me," he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are out on a mission to “struggle against and block.”
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a person high in the Republican party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at dusk, sucking many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach. They did not run immediately and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster response BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Around 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Emergency services have released aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The storm continued to rock the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday’s major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and 29 are reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300-km coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live here,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading for the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," they said.
The agency was criticised on Saturday from many fronts for failing to disclose that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings about the tsuami coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending emergency cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but food and basic necessities are still badly needed among the evacuees.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision’s employees from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu city, where employees take shelter under tarpaulins set up in the courtyard by their account. They came past areas of extensive destruction on the road, Doseba said.
"They said they saw so many destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid agencies began the hard work of putting the relief effort back on track, there were complaints that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and staff from abroad may only enter if the area where the accident has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can open for international assistance, but there’s no status yet.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family held on to the missing people, hoping that their loved ones would become the miracles that brighten the grim tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandino, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
“As a veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel, he was circulating in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one gray checkmark instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he says.
Twenty takes 26.750 USD during filling of ATM in Newport on the Levee
Twenty-six stole $26,750 Friday morning from a Brink's employee who was about to meet an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police press release.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change Saturday on Twitter, writing: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current stage name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that’s us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported preferring the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West’s former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also switched between upper and lower case letters and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico’s AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in many parts of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly government grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various sections of the U.S. government have issued statements about artificial intelligence, but the U.S. still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced its plan last year and aims to take the lead in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we’re looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next great achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google’s department in China.
Lee acknowledged past technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when there will be a new competition so that the next visionaries can be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain grants from the government, Lee says.
“It’s not China that’s grabbing the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered work permits.
China’s State Council released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a manner similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations’ distribution of money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, which will involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
U.S. legislation seeking to create a national security commission for artificial intelligence, however, has been standing still for months.
Macedonians vote to change country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a claim on Greek territory, and has therefore used their right of veto when Macedonia has sought membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the number of voters will make up the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will abide by the result of the vote and make it happen.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent at the last general election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children; we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change of the country's name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with a raised forehead, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote for it because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be "securing our future".
A poll released last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote – fewer than the required voter turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be valid, the voter turnout must be at least 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights his way through the entire Brighton defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling battled Brighton in Manchester City’s 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before swinging out into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He fought his way past one defender, and subsequently ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to outsmart Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
The goal came after 29 minutes.
In that sequence, Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton's territory.
He sent a handsome pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward dashed the ball into the net just before it slid past goal.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to tease the Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the toss on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a possibility of participation in the playoffs for the Rockies, who have played a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least held on to a wild-card spot with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still have their first division title to their credit.
“While we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest level here in Denver and that opponents would be playing at probably the highest level I’m going to face this year.
Why shouldn’t I be excited to play in those conditions?”
The Nationals have yet to announce the starting lineup for Sunday, but are likely to put Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his throws on Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The right-hander from Washington is at 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans showing up at the polls in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big ones – you can’t vote for me, but you actually vote for me. That’s why I travel around fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it’s happening right now.
And they're determined to get power back by any means they can, and you can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we don't want to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have as mission "struggle against and block".
“And you’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and vicious and disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned the name of the top Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, which loudly triggered the booing from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, wait – that was really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer an inclusive party.
They are intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome – just because we have made our opinion known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship measure was to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, in Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The convening of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local MEP, Friday night's sittings have been exactly that.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not like that, and the promise of a "friendlier, gentler" policy goes way back in the past if it ever got started.
It has become increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that all opinions are weighed according to whether the party leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared political views began to expect me to take a U-turn and take positions with which I would never have otherwise agreed – whether it was about national security or the EU’s internal market.
When I speak my opinion in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – I follow a long string of crude messages on social media that call for opt-out and contradiction of the centrist policy and tell me that I shouldn’t be a member of Labour.
And that’s not just my experience.
In fact, I am luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are usually political.
I have a deep respect for the professionalism and fighting spirit of those colleagues who, every day, are swamped with sexism or racism, yet continue to fight on.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a culture of tolerance.
But in reality it is no longer a capacious organization and with every censure vote or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the past two years that if I put a lid on myself and don’t shout so loudly, I’ll be “okay”.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was in school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a dilapidated state, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether as a councillor or a minister in government.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one at Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would say that as the country surges towards Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local electorate, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of choice or political aptitude will deter me from acting on what I believe is in your interest.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have caused the final score to paint a not entirely truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this fantastically entertaining match of the day in Tennent’s Premiership.
They are now at the top of the leaderboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better use of chance that carried the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie had an absolute right to be satisfied.
“Our fights have been demanding so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they took their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's goal after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr to the front, but a yellow card for Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, awarded to the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a goal that was not followed by a kick.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty just before the half. He scored and then got a solo score, so there was 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried off the field on a stretcher. When play resumed, Ayr extended the lead with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Acting Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a shot from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team reappeared, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson was able to score after a line-out behind the advancing Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the bars and followed up with a more almost straight after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry off for the home field's fifth goal.
Still Game star looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be making the move to the restaurant industry after it emerged that he has taken up the directorship of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character in together with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the landlocked state of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol around the naval headquarters, shrouded in rigging, in La Paz.
In public buildings, a blue flag is raised.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It is our duty to take it back.”
Throughout the landlocked state of Bolivia, the memory of a stretch of coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still strong, as is the longing to sail the Pacific once again.
Hopes are perhaps at their highest for several decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
“Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course is waiting with a positive eye on the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on big screens throughout the country and hope that the court in The Hague will agree with Bolivia that Chile – after decades of discussions – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake at the sentencing on Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will side with Bolivia – and that there would not be much change if it did.
The UN Assembly, which is based in the Netherlands, does not have the power to overrun Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The International Court of Justice’s ruling just six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have been a setback.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has done away with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end an era of 139 years of disagreements and gain benefits for both parties,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past.”
North Korea says it will not denuclearize unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never dismantle its nuclear weapons if it could not first trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments were given in response to the fact that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently facing a restart of frozen nuclear diplomacy over three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a “wishful dream” that continued sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War would ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reticent about the declaration as long as Pyongyang has not first taken significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal, which it most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with big headwear, which you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a collection of extra-large headwear on the catwalk as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated on Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work by Valentino was a sumptuous one with a feather-like broad shadow covering the models’ heads.
There were other extra-large accessories too, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they aren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn-together lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving gear with a snorkel and a mask, and others resembled a melted waffle ice cream.
And if you continue the great fashion statements, you are in luck.
Style scouts predict that the huge hats could get to stores near you.
The giant hats arrive on the heels of "La Bomba," the straw hat with a 60-centimeter-wide shadow seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which is behind the highly impractical hat spread across social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model displaying it.
The orange bast bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in regular stores next summer. The designer has been so influential that it’s going to be hard to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it’s continued in 2018 with yet another series of outstanding exam results, which are further enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can put together and implement a tailored curriculum, we find that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits the heart."
It’s an important reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest exam results this year that languages are highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS' 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received an A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as a topic choice at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in independent schools’ curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the reasons why employers were unable to fill vacancies, 17% had a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities in the future will require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career the young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start to the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 people in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to carry on a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
Being able to speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be truly important for the country’s future in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in the degree programmes.
Modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won’t play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to the Lakers' planned six games before the start of the season.
“Where I am in my career, I don’t need to fight before the start of the season to get ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a string of voter rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scheduled rallies next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump’s appointed judge to the vacant Supreme Court seat has been suspended, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump’s election rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place at midnight on the night of Saturday, November 29, 2018 to Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election rally in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week’s hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the hearings were tense over allegations of sexually offensive behavior, and the expected Senate confirmation vote has been suspended for a week as the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the primary goal of this streak of voter rallies is to create momentum for Republicans facing a tough election in November.
People from President Trump’s campaign team said the five rallies next week are aimed at “creating energy among volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Controlling Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter busy campaign time,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The evening’s rally, held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, is expected to attract Trump supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican nominee for Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to step up to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science professor at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown fighting spirit and is trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday’s singles duels
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday’s four-man duels were perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there is momentum now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we probably see that as a little bit of momentum," Spieth said.
Europe, of course, has the advantage. They are 4 points ahead and there are 12 points more to play for.
As Spieth says, however, Americans feel that they have a bit of wind in their sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both boast three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The cheers grew louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important putt, securing victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two shots behind after two duels.
His putt that secured them the match on hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows he doesn’t think the American team is out of the competition yet.
“You just need to find that inner strength and focus on your own struggle,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left.
There are 18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, arguably the greatest story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sympathetic pair have scored four points in four matches and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way in which the energy seems to flow both to and from the wild crowd shows that they are the ones who will be the hardest to beat on Sunday, and it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were to be cemented by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably synchronous on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a brief trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning of the four-man duels, when he partnered with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
No one can help you get out of your hole.
Matches with four balls and two teams of two players are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change in a flash.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of last day of Ryder Cup
Europe has a big advantage before the final day of the Ryder Cup, after coming out of Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods and have so far scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, trying to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an imprecise American team in this morning’s fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes. They won four games, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team will need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their first four games.
They smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a disheartened Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through the first two games Saturday, had some brilliant flashes, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning’s fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and scored a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – who are third in the world.
Europe, however, is as it pleases on a windy day south-west of Paris.
Triple Major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas led the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They had a hard-fought 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought their way back after being behind by four points before the singles matches. As Furyks currently have the trophy, however, they only need to achieve a draw to keep it.
After being second-best for two days, however, it seems they can’t master a counterattack Sunday.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally if there is no trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions reinforce their distrust of the United States and that the country will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the organization's General Assembly that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, shutting down an area for nuclear testing, and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and technology.
“We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States,” he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such conditions, there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and disarm unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean grievances about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as has otherwise been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim promised to work “nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to softening up tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first,’ adding to the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purposes by force, and even opposing the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream among people who don’t know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding, “If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so deadlocked.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris’ speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea’s rockets at the US mainland was inevitable after “Mr Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened at the UN with the “total annihilation” of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for his courage in disarmament, but said there is still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for these actions, but said "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council must uphold sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve total, final, affirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, while North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands" just hours later.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the US took “similar steps.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding steps” he demanded were the security promises Trump made in Singapore, as well as moves toward a normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard Take Course on Getting Enough Sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture where you study all night sustained by large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world’s best university often don’t know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has completed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“When the paper was finished, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now that I’m on the candidate list?’
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits can improve one’s academic and sporting performance as well as one’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health department, says the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
Among other things, the hour-long course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a dorm room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to get knowledge about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one’s sporting performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how sleep deprivation over a long period of time increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on various icons on an interactive map of the campus.
"We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking an “allnighter” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said — it even counteracts weight gain because sleep deprivation makes the brain think you’re starving, which is why they’re constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, last year helped Professor Czeisler organize the course when he took one of his courses in his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and had him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that next, all graduates will be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens, which can shift the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal from Menga lowers Gerrard and co.
The Rangers suffered another defeat away from home when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's incoherent team had to settle for a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team were looking for their first win away from home since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only the second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving Hearts eight points ahead of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, to which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third place after Hibernian with only the score difference.
And there could be more bad news en route to Rangers, as linebacker Calum Spence had to be dealt with after being hit in the head by a thrown object that appeared to be coming from the off-field section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up that reached the Betfed Cup semi-finals by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, faced with the same 11, who shaved a point off Hearts' lead last week, and he would have delighted to see his sharp team exhausting opponents all over the pitch.
The Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more efficient.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt slipped by.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found its way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the back post.
The Rangers took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attacking game.
Alfredo Morales was certainly not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson overruled the Colombian’s appeals for a penalty when he and Steven Lawless clashed after 15 minutes of play.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livi’s opening in the 34th minute was something of a coincidence, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, the Rangers couldn’t handle a dead-ball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it into the goal.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately paid off when the winger sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the away team to play on their terms with many long balls up the field from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have extended the lead in the final part of the game, but McGregor turned Jacobs down with a sure hand before Lithgow headed next to goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penalty after turning with Jacobs, but referee Thomson also looked the other way.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": The 30th of September, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we count... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become an integral part of both science and popular culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as peasant scientists:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals is making."
Evans: "Oh, come on, it's on!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to 'see' cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Cancer Cells as Part of Treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine holds promise in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "causes several cancers to develop", including breast, ovarian, lung and bowel cancers," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent appearance on the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was booed off as he paid tribute to US President Donald Trump, saying he himself would run for president in 2020.
After playing tonight’s third song Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he began a thunderous speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
“I talk so often to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
But if I worried about racism, I would have moved out of the United States long ago," he said.
SNL kicked off tonight's show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock West uploaded the tirade on social media.
It is uncertain whether Rock tried to expose West by posting the footage.
West also complained to the audience about poor backstage treatment because of his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And they said I had sunk deep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I've sunk?", saying that he would put on his Superman cape because it means that "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try it with love.”
The audience booed at least twice by his comments, and the SNL staff appeared to be embarrassed, Variety said with a comment from a person present: "There was a standstill in the studio."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West got support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR NOT LETING YOUR COU OF THE PUBLIC."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West just “is who he is, and that’s just fine.”
But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes, or supporting his “art”) who embraces and propagates an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he has taken the name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in the Belfast District Court on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington lashes out at toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for wielding swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor lashes out at the stereotypical macho hero, saying that these kinds of TV characters mean that young men often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told the Sunday Times Culture that he believes “something has gone wrong” and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem is "very close to his heart."
“At the moment it’s very close to my heart – where have we gone wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“If we look at the current problems, what have we taught young men as they were growing up?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel that they have to be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
It is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not be making sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "done with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing about the entire Game of Thrones experience.
“I met my wife because of this series, so in that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family’s estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected, health officials said.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way has been reduced to near zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually Transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women sooner or later because of the country’s conservative values.
Many cases of infection are caused by failure to use contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
A member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, denied allegations Saturday that a member of her staff shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations originated from websites and supporters of the “extreme right.”
"Lies, lies and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The released information allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters' staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie,” Waters said.
The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie.”
Waters' statement quickly received online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you are accused of something you have not done, do not get angry.
One must not be defiant.
The motives of the accuser must not be questioned.
You have to keep calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate aiming to take Waters’ place in the midterm elections, also made his opinion known on Twitter.
“Great, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations."
"We want to make sure that the perpetrators are found," she continued, "and that they will be held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous for everyone on my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again – underwhelming spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It’s become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in any recent film with a British twist, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English – born again.
Will dry, sarcastic self-satisfaction, about how grievous things are with us, become the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and big eyes has had his permission to make blunders renewed again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comical invention aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the goofy secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and proper snippet of him who performed a single note for the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international sneaker that left chaos in his wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are a few good moments in this latest shot from JE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers clung to his helmet.
You can see Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy, but the humor feels rather underwhelming and strangely superfluous, especially now that more “serious” film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer compelling comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be geared towards children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English’s wacky adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent-movie gibberish in the role of Mr. Bean.
The starting point for the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the British agents in the field to the dismay of the agent in charge – a sadly minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last chance for a pompous and combative prime minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there’s not much to work on in the script.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is forced to cancel someone’s pension.
And of course it’s the clumsy Johnny English, who is now the headmaster of an upper-class school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for a kind of School of Rock education in espionage.
English rushes back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunites with his tried and tested former right hand Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now married an overenthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine is wasted on.
Thus, the Royal Intelligence Agency's most painstaking Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is on the brink of being smothered by the charismatic and sinister tech billionaire Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a distinguished French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English creates pure Armageddon as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta’s house.
All the guns are fired in the film's closing sequence, but however well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of children's television about it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn’t help but think with the other Johnny English films: Can’t the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does his talent justice?
Labour rejects four-day working week plan with unchanged pay for British workers
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour is said to be considering a radical plan so that the English can settle for a four-day working week but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have a three-day weekend without going down in salary.
Sources state that the idea would be consistent with the party’s economic goal of pulling the country in a more favorable direction for the workers.
The Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
“It’s not going to happen in a day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the party’s approach to changing the economy for the benefit of the workers and to the party’s overall strategy for industry.”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the goal is not unanimously supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not party policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour’s shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week’s party meeting recording his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to rip power back from “anonymous executives” and “exploitsers” in utilities.
The shadow finance minister’s plans also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders of water utilities will get their money back, as a Labour-led government could “count them off” on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get workers on company boards and to set up including owner funds to distribute 10 percent of the stock value of private companies to employees, who stand to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their vote
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week. And that raises the question of whether the FBI’s findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that might make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went into the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, “Did you do that?”
He was strong, determined and clear-cut.”
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to be set in stone.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and anything else would require a very strong accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett denied it in the strongest possible terms," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see how that would change anything.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will for the seventh time receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s grand lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will raise awareness of the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you don’t want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a series of tasks or “actions.” For example, doing volunteer work, writing to a world leader, making a phone call, or some other meaningful action that can raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years to reach the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert create real change, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – i.e. people feel that they are making a difference by signing a petition online or making a Twitter post?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its members targeting various targets.
They believe that these actions have spurred world leaders to make binding targets and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had been created due to their actions, which amounted to over $10 billion that had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, a collaboration between investors and high-achieving individuals, which aims to “help children reach their full potential” and promises $35 million to alleviate nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, the social injustice of malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, the Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
wrote Global Citizen: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement, we will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the performers at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will be the hosts.
The US can use its navy to "block" Russian energy exports, says the US interior minister
“If necessary, Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East,” Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s interference in Syria—especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government—is a pretext for expanding sales of its energy.
“I think they’re in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States, with our fleet, has the ability to ensure that there is free passage on the seaways, and if it becomes necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at a meeting of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that considers itself “the voice of the American energy consumer.”
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are essentially the same.
“The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about harnessing and replacing fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump has made Berlin the “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
“I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their supplier,” Novak said at a meeting in Moscow with Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, BDI, has asked the US to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third party meddling in our energy supplies,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'considering strongly' running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren is "considering strongly" running for president after the midterm elections, she said Saturday.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and that requires a woman in front,” she said.
"After November 6, I will strongly consider running for president."
Warren made his views known on President Donald Trump during City Council, saying he is “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren wrote, “Of course, the FBI must investigate the matter before the vote.”
However, a poll on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own backcountry do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a poll from the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% against a possible lineup.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden announced his decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
On Monday, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through after he comes home allows me to relate to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning home with,” she told the crowd at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become tougher. They go and think if there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for obstructing a report of domestic violence, and for possession of a weapon while intoxicated, said Dan Bennet, a police spokesman in Wasilla.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a nonpartisan statement Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace vs. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal law, has not been made public.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of American asylum seekers come from, as countries with far-reaching problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a decision made by the U.S. Immigration Appeals Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney Karl Racine said Friday that the new law "disregards decades of state, federal, and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle runs counter to that principle,” the statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the Rejection of Immigrants Act harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become self-employed and “deliver necessary labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions stripped immigration judges of the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political standpoint,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the law.
It has never been intended that asylum should remedy all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people all over the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate.
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
“It’s very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her fever-stricken little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water.”
The residents now returned to their destroyed homes to sort out soaked belongings and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also hit by the 7.5 earthquake, could not keep up.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside Palus military hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to strong aftershocks.
Tears came to his eyes as he recounted how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed against a broken wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Improper Practices and Propaganda Ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US daily that beat the drum for the benefits of US-Chinese cooperation, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily’s paid entry in the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 Congressional elections. China rejects the accusation.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump’s accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. election marks a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war in which they have repeatedly imposed tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the trade war were supposed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China former governor for a number of years in Iowa, which is a major exporter of agri-food products to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an editorial in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that China is “escalating the use of crude methods by running propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the proud American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find only a few dissenting voices, and you will not get a true picture of the Chinese people's differing views on China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, though he did not say which one.
Republicans alienate women ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will see a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The issue has been heated, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
“This cannot be undone,” Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes’ (Arizona) request for an 11th-hour FBI investigation would soften the anger of voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they don’t forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, demonstrators shouted, “November is coming!” as the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to reach new heights,” independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
“People say it has already reached a high level; that’s right.
But it may reach even higher, especially among suburban female swing voters and younger voters—18-29—who rarely vote, despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford’s public accusations of the Supreme Court nominee’s sexual misconduct, analysts had pointed out that it could backfire if Republicans continued with the nomination.
“It’s become a mess for the Republicans,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the start of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh will be held accountable; it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democrats in getting elected, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to have different opinions on who to believe after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter having a bit more on their side.
A recent YouGov poll found that 41% of respondents probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh either probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At Flake’s request, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other person.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party when they were both studying at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to make a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology so people can create their own “personal online data collection” or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to bring together resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contract, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team aren’t talking to “Facebook or Google about whether to completely change everything so that all of their business models suddenly become redundant.”
“We’re not asking for your permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet being built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the internet’s next period,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Recipient of the Victoria Cross from the First World War
The Church of England’s only priest to win the Victoria Cross by fighting in World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel and Reverend Bernard Wann won the order on 29 September 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's orderly feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy machine gun and artillery fire."
He later ran to the front line and led his men forward with the "greatest courage" before attacking only one artilleryman and defusing three guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honoured to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underscores the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine staying up all night to watch the star-studded Bellator 206 and then being denied the main event.
There were 13 games on the San Jose schedule, including six games on the main schedule, and they were shown throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to meet each other, viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the broadcast switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early morning for that particular fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke."
“According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., which is why they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president, when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work to include English viewers in the planning ahead.
“When you think about the re-broadcast, I think we can make it work,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock Sunday morning over there, and we won’t find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
In fact, it was the law.
I can promise you that it won’t happen next time.
We're just going for five games instead of six, like we normally do, trying to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "inferiority" over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else growing up because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he got into the bigger classes that “everyone isn’t like me.”
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said he was less concerned about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host of the long-running radio show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first program, saying that he felt "less worth" than everyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, the feelings of feeling worthy and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT champion and used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for the decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said he had been "surprised" when he fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years his senior, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
He told me that it’s hard to find someone the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when going through so much at such a young age – he went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple in June became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "his whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would all be about whether I should win a gold medal,” he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had got tickets to London 2012 – as he would sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there by then.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it only dawned on me that he wasn’t immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – which had meant a lot in the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unsharp Mickelson on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he must do something about the form if it is not to become a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets a record by taking part for the 12th time in the competition, which takes place every two years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action for the United States as usual, the five-time big winner had to act as a cheerleader and practice his game in the hope of correcting the slippage.
Even at the peak of his career, he had the most equal drive, so the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes stray shots.
And if the pitch wasn’t big enough, Mickelson will face the ever-precise winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari at Sunday’s ninth game, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who start the 12 singles matches, start strong, Mickelson’s fight could be decisive.
Furyk expressed no surprise confidence in his teammate.
“He understood his role completely today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of faith in himself."
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams in the past – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought he was going to play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson broke Nick Faldo’s record for most Ryder Cup appearances.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, though Furyk said his presence contributes something indefinable.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s witty, he likes to stick to people, and he’s good to have in the team room,” he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He brings a lot more than just the game.”
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup singles match can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans, but was close to being overtaken before the finish line with a victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a good lead in Valderrama, we had a good lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just won," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
“History tells me and the rest of the team that it’s not over.
It's going to be full of shit tomorrow.
Get out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have one goal and that is to try to win the trophy and that is where our focus lies.
I’ve always said that I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Satisfied with his players' performances on a difficult pitch, Bjorn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it will be the individual performances that count, and that is something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested on all parameters as a golfer.
That’s what the players need to understand – bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, for he must also bring out the best in himself."
Opponent Jim Furyk is hoping for better individual performance than in the partnership game, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced some twists and turns on the last day, first on the winning team in Brookline, before he lost when Europe made the "Miracle at Medinah".
“I remember every single word,” he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We put our team together according to that and put the players on the pitch in the order we feel like. We’re trying to create magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the rebound and faces Rory McIlroy in the top flight, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it secures us all the way through,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles players.
Germany's new warship to be launched
The German Navy’s newest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. But the Germans will have to wait at least another year due to technical problems and an escalating price, writes local media.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, the "Rhineland-Palatinate", has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet in 2014, but after-delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
About them it is known that they will have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the newest frigates is a reduced need for maintenance: it should be possible to keep the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are supposed to make Germany look like an overseas power – will already be obsolete when they are deployed.
The failed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware failures" that rendered the warship unusable in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be steered by a crew of 120 sailors – that’s only half of the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the fleet's ability for future updates.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an original price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates are becoming even more important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defense committee, admitted earlier this year that the navy "is running out of ships ready for deployment."
The official said the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to join the fleet.
National Trust stealthily listens to the secret life of bats
New research from an area of the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland’s National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at carefully selected locations in the area to record the bats’ activities throughout the season.
Data is also collected by staff from NTS and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analyses of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bat calls and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape image of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
Nature conservation advisor to NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows, and how best to preserve woodlands for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect nests and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials, and pet infestations.
Bats are not blind.
However, because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more usable than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to find insects and fly around obstacles.
The NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes make rescues.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat sanctuary in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bat species.
The area's manager, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There’s a lot you don’t know about bats, so working here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on property, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, thereby risking the extinction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to lend a hand.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don’t know how populations evolve.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges as lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him “fake news” and said people “will promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news outlet Der Spiegel, which brought the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, criticizing the information as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They will promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and all is well," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they have called “an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions about privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz says the player would seek compensation for "moral depravity in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the report filed in the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell to his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was "a good guy 99% of the time" gripped by "the one percent".
The lawsuit alleges that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she felt "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly shamed".
The 34-year-old says she will cancel the deal, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was facing a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident was supposed to have taken place, and switched this summer to Italian giants Juventus for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as the leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would cut production temporarily at the plant in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting times at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“The way I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK exits the EU at the end of March,” Burnaston CEO Marvin Cooke said.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fears of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade.
BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers has to do with risks with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal exit.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, problems could arise at the border, which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day’s production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "composed so as to accurately avoid these checks at the border."
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us not just – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what have been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term, higher prices would reduce the factory’s competitiveness, ultimately costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint shop steward at the factory, says that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won't come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “be postponed for another week” as the showdown over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein watches Special Counsel Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his investigation into Russian election interference, connections between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby risk Mueller’s independence has been a gossip topic in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was arranged Thursday with Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There is no set date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with everything going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll have to see, and I like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press briefings was not because TV journalists were playing for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree that they're playing up to the camera."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president is taking more questions from the press than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing a source: “We’ve been looking at the numbers.”
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions of the president of the United States, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to give plenty of opportunity, and you’ve seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it’s going to be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press conferences with high-ranking guests.
Press conferences with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an impromptu and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Health Minister contacts EU staff in the Scottish healthcare sector after Brexit concerns
The health minister has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have continued, and it looks as if decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a no-deal Brexit.
I know this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts made by each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare for the benefit of patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love for you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell out there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are "no details about the type or extent of the injury yet," and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he sustained the injury.
Abercrombie is studying for his second year and is in the process of his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 tackles overall this season.
Foreign buyers charged higher stamp duty when buying house in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK. The extra money should, according to the Conservative Party, help the homeless.
This move should dampen Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will affect those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when buying properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after those with the highest incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will hit people and businesses who don’t pay taxes in the UK. Earnings from this will be used for the government’s fight to ensure everyone has a place to sleep.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent out, can reach 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new construction in London is bought by people living abroad, which increases prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land they don't use, and asked May to drop quotas on cheap housing to address Britain's "shameful housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed a conspicuous series of housing reforms, including controlling rents and depriving landlords of the opportunity to put people on the streets if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the ability to build public housing.
May said: “Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life gets better with each generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as it is for hard-working Britons.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still far too prevalent.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be Scotland's coach"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to eventually become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the North East, who now have third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back into the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always drawn me in.
However, that opportunity would only arise if I am successful in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors as coach of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he had no qualms about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success by whether 'I can get this club back into the Premier League.'
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I’ll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross is just three years into his coaching career after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return after being relegated to the third tier and transformed St Mirren from relegation threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he remembers about his time in Alloa.
"I honestly thought that coaching was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange, because I did well, earned sensibly and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you have to do on a weekly basis.
There’s still that kind of stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven't felt more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 5:30 p.m., study shows
The heatwave this summer has boosted profits for England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants fell by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA who collected the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long World Cup have meant that July follows the June pattern, with pubs experiencing upsells of 2.8%, except that restaurants are harder hit now.
The 1.8% drop in restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focusing on the sale of beverages clearly performed best and experienced progress similar to the restaurants’ decline.
Pubs with a focus on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, beverage sales increased by 6.6% for the month, while food declined by 3.3%.”
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to out-of-home sales, the weather and major social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
It’s no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, though a 4.8% drop in sales year after year will hurt real bad on top of rising costs.
The long, hot summer couldn’t come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide a much-needed respite.”
The total increase in total sales for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, which shows the decrease in newly started brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales figures of the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and they are leaders in the field.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children – as young as 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A study of 20,000 school students in grades 4-9 reveals growth in “fake Insta” pages.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being posted
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show to their parents
One in five children as young as 11 years old creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from 4th grade onwards reveals rampant growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being posted.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show to their parents while also having private ones.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teenager encouraging others to "rape me."
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s scary that so many teens are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "athletes' voice" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics at the Governing Body’s Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most winning athlete, and chairman Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those making decisions about sport to benefit from her vast 10-year experience at an international level.
“Eilidh is highly regarded in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit from her joining the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help set a direction for sport in Scotland."

I couldn't walk.
The doctors said time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am completely healthy, have learned to walk again and today doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers to cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump,” the tech-savvy consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cowshed filled with hay to a song that reads, among other things: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, this isn't udder, it's my breasts."
The chorus is, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bosom."
But the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from viewers, many saying it makes fun of the “horror” of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," a user wrote.

Another wrote: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to promote a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another added, "What an insensitive advertisement."
One woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“It’s a brilliant product,” he wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the advertisement is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and CEO of Mother, wrote: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of breast pumping, while entertainingly and recognisably showing the freedom that the new pump can provide.”
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of cross-border migrants has not changed. This is partly due to tougher rhetoric and the Trump administration’s tougher laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by standing up and welcoming a child.
The risk of repatriation increased in June when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would be fingerprinted and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that they had arrested several people who were seeking to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had clean criminal records.
“Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors’ households are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to hunt those people,” Albence said.
In trying to deal with children’s cases more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention. Before that, it was within 60 days, say aid workers.
Many use video calls instead of turning up and pleading their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those found to be ineligible for asylum will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the higher the likelihood of anxiety or depression leading to violent outcomes or attempted escape, according to aid workers and reports released from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say these risks are more pronounced at larger facilities like Tornillo, where size makes it harder to keep an eye on whether a child is suffering.
They added that relocating to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is "almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleansed all Syrian areas" of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return home, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fear" that caused the refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these repatriations,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no help will be made available to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province, where three million people live, was avoided.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists from the Nusra Front, a progenitor group of Al-Qaeda that “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee soon to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election. The committee is made up of government and opposition members.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the legislation in the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Trump wins another presidential term
By that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020 unless the impeachment and scandals end his presidency prematurely, as many liberal viewers might hope.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!"
Currently, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have nearly doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on nights of big news.
“It’s a spectacle that people are attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a cabinet leader who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and the author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell said.
The chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other TV shows, the stories coming from Washington can decide the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only for the most privileged.
And yet, it’s about more than being an enlightened citizen when you watch six hours of panel discussion, where experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” when writing his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“covered with hubris,” The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’ vivid descriptions of Trump’s anatomy.
I don't think I'll ever see Super Mario in the same way.
“One of the things that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the Trump show’s rotating crew and daily surprises (battles with N.F.L., praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a paragraph, you're off.
When I got Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people were like, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Large sums of money find their way to the close mid-term elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of an equalization of two “Congressional Districts”, two congressmen are fighting for the same seat.
This recently redeveloped suburban district in Pittsburg is causing problems for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent Congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, which overlaps sharply with the new 17th.
The maps were redone after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district was unlawfully set up in favor of Republicans.
The battle for the new 17th district has started a struggle for funding between the major party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-profile March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been in Republican hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. was considering punishing El Salvador for aid to China, but changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump’s management team.
State Department officials decided to recall senior U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only El Salvador was penalized, receiving about $140 million from the US in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts to financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit on security and economic development. It should have continued last year’s meeting, which was considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thus dropping consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to send a signal of the importance Americans place on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three US envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh demands or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who wanted to talk about the internal deliberations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on a condition of anonymity.
Know the story
The next hurdle could well be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Reportedly, Mueller will also direct his investigation into the question of whether Trump’s campaign secretly colluded with Russia in the attack on the election.
If Congress were to come into new hands, Trump would likely be held accountable as he prepares to meet again with the electorate and, in time, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I am not claiming that Trump’s end is inevitable – and so are his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the struggle will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage thereafter.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history turns and the irreversible march of democracy increases or decreases.
The United States is now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who will determine the future of Mueller’s investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein’s seat has been warm since the present newspaper reported that he had proposed last year to make covert recordings of the president and questioned his suitability for the office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' account is inaccurate.
“How do we react if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not conducted properly — or if he is cleared to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we at the midterm elections vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the very Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy’s homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien
After the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, with a win against the Austrians, the Rangers will have a good chance of progressing from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his season debut before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the game with the belief that we could bring something home and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the plug home, but all in all, it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last game. But with the audience behind us I am sure that we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but the atmosphere is good now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. We train well.
Hopefully we can go on now, put last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of retirement makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family about it.
About half of the participants in Nationswide’s study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“Most people would like a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do anything to initiate the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationswide’s life insurance business.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them well in advance about your wishes.
Use your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be determining factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can, among other things, be financed through a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the finances to do so.
Get the legal documents in order: Take the legal battles in the bud.
Get a power of attorney prepared so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and medical staff comply with your wishes in case you can not communicate yourself.
Also consider a financial power of attorney.
In that case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and ensure that your bills are paid if you are not able to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that one of your aging parents is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing so you’re ready.
“It’s not just a question of economics – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who takes care of the dog?
Get the plan in place.”
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a tour of the city.
The victim was in his 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as "absolutely random."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are urging witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the number of people killed to rise.
Since the communication routes are out of play, aid workers have been unable to receive information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that extends over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the Central Sudanese economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster centre.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was hit again by a tsunami, which killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called ring of fire in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, including over half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, spreading devastation and panic as the population was reminded of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, preventing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bail without security, KTUU reports.
He was tried on Saturday, where he pleaded "clearly not guilty," the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which can lead to a penalty of a single day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is pending before the Alaskan Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of a violent crime in the home, and possession of a weapon while under the influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a slap in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for explaining her son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communications, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating that show the moment when the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public prosecutors try to get terror suspect in NYC sentenced to rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people—a rare punishment who was last convicted of a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were cut down.
As the basis for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious personal injury. This is required by the letter of intent for capital punishment in New York’s southern district.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible outcome of both these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov with a 22-point indictment, including eight charges of murder in connection with gangster activity, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and one charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "extensive planning and preparations," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "horrific, vicious and depraved."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement of intent said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s Southern District last raised defendants in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up receiving life imprisonment in September 2009.
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953 after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to court documents, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was comfortable with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the officers said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s lawyers had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative minister believes NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must be able to “feel the pressure” from eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May’s own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
Private Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham rally that Britain would have "been out by now" if Farage had been the Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge to unite the deeply divided party is underlined by Conservative Remainers taking part in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track under attack from both Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thereby forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or “chaos”.
At the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added, “I will fight for Brexit, but we need to scrap Chequers.”
On the background of his EU opposition, he said: “We didn’t fight world wars to be anybody’s subordinate.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected that public opinion should have changed since the 2016 vote: “That the British people should have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular in the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who are actually on the streets and getting us elected.
Drop the Chequers and start listening.”
As a pointed remark to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the parade that politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they fail to make the decision from the 2016 vote.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They will betray Brexit, but we are here to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “You need to make sure that the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, can feel the pressure.
“We are mobilising the people’s army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour procession in the city centre.
Scattered activists waved Conservative Against Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis, before the meeting, made fun of the security problems with the Conservative Party app.
“These are the people who claim to be in control of the IT systems and technology for Canada, for border controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he said.
"It's a joke.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren 'considering strongly' running for president
U.S. House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly running for president" after the midterm elections in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a city council meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, will seek re-election in November against state Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It has been speculated that she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
A contestant asked her if she plans to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time for “women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and that requires a woman in front.”
Arrest in LSU's Sims Shooting Robbery Case
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested Friday for the shooting at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They had released a video Friday of the shooting to ask for help identifying a man on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died from the injuries," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul said, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being present, possessing a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-meter-tall third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season, he played 32 games, started in ten, and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to World Cup, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team’s orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the lead position, Bottas got off to a good start and came close to untying Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in the pit as the first, leaving Hamilton to fight with traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front when the Ferrari driver, after some wheel contact, reluctantly had to leave the inner lane after a double defense at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead in much of the race, failing to change tyres to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place in an attempt for a quick finish.
He had to go in the pit on the 44th lap, but could not increase the pace on the last eight laps, so Raikkonen secured fourth place.
“It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did great all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me come by.
The team did an incredible job to secure both first and second place,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump taunted Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for insisting she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony that Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that events in the Senate showed that people were “wicked and disgusting and dishonest.”
“The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that’s happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see that anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at statements and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember her response... Was it you who leaked the document – “uh, uh, what?
No, no, no, no.
I didn't leak anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an impersonation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I have not concealed Dr. Ford’s allegations and I have not leaked her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said at Saturday's rally: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
During the president’s continued defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexually assaulting three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats used the accusations to benefit their own cause.
“They are not afraid to take back their power.
You can see the cruelty, the ugliness, they don’t care who they have to drum up to get power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered from Friday's lost Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the return 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly got ahead with two goals with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized at home before Dwyer again brought the Giants up front.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the season's third Elite League defeat for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's match in Belfast.
It was the season's fourth meeting between the sides, where the Giants went out as victors in the three previous games.
Dwyer set out in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford assisting, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead at the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again equalized with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed to ensure hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died to ensure a plane carrying hundreds of passengers landed safely on the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake on Friday hit Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung’s colleagues fled for their lives, he refused to leave his seat in the swaying control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed back in his seat to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was holding on to the runway, got safely airborne.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are devastated,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, and the country's disaster response agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins and it is not possible to reach them," said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly relief and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance arrives with more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to get.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military, “I ask you all to work around the clock to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombrok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says a man is missing after plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia says a man is missing, although all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane flew past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed in very shallow water.
"That was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could walk in water to life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the crew panicked and shouted, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to renovate a nearby berth also helped in the rescue effort by using a dinghy to bring people ashore before the plane sank at about 100 feet [30 m].
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analyst establishes timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office closed its evidence on Saturday during the appeal of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teleinformation to piece together the course of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he was getting location data from several different cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers' cell phone at the time he had alleged that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the witness stand on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to get back to basics and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently gained a revival in the UK due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny in New York sues couple after firing with "racist" text message
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after being sent a text message by mistake from her mother complaining that she was "yet another black person."
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the lawsuit to "blackmail."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEE, NOT YET A BLACK PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the “inconvenient” Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice, saying their former nanny, as from African-American, had been bad at her job, and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day’s work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, as well as compensation for $350 a day for the six months she was supposed to have lived with the family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t afford to do that,” she told the newspaper Friday, adding, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple have defended themselves by saying that they are not racists and that the dismissal of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something that she would not have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Plasco told The Post.
“But would you leave your children to someone you’d been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on.
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "blackmail" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you really looking for someone like that?
It’s not very friendly done,” added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the People's Court has already dismissed the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the first to read it before it was published.
It's pretty fun to read now that you know how popular Paddington became."
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little clothes teddy bear, would have been optimistic, though his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says her father was proud of his success in all modesty.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag," she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who accomplished something: you’re proud of them, even if it’s not really your doing.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Saying goodbye to a dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called periodically to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she was going to die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see ya.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart going slowly lost its effect.
She had died shortly before, and now her body was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to pull myself together.”
Eventually, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I bowed my head and the tears kept running.
It’s hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women try to stop suicide jumpers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a map of a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day,” she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
His smile was familiar to everyone.
People said his smile lit up the room."
However, he stopped working before he died because he felt really bad.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found him after he took his own life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid it's going to spread."
Sharon Davis made the cards to “tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say anything about being sad or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, he started to change.
When the children opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all need to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still undecided as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for—a limited-time investigation of limited scope—we might get a little bit of a consensus,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee “fell off the hook” in the midst of the stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct their investigation?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans, as expected, do poorly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest judicial office in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the deciding vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'falling' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from South Korea’s unification ministry, saying there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to people smugglers were contributing to the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most are fleeing via China, which has the longest border adjacent to North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China regards the defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forcibly repatriated.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are technically still at war – have significantly improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the stalled talks on nuclear disarmament.
This follows the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea on a global level.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is out of the question that we will disarm on our own,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says he's unfit for Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comments came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved that way, you would have called her hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost yelled and was about to cry.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him “grotesque and a coordinated courage of character” organized by the left, who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved he could not sit on the Supreme Court because it showed that he is biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi shrugged it off when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I would say that if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to sit on the Supreme Court, but certainly not in the court he sits in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in connection with Obama's health care reform or the Roe v. Wade abortion case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn certain previous Supreme Court rulings.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, biased person has to hold a job as a judge and expects us to say, 'Well, isn't it just wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal. Do you think?"
She continued, "I got a lot of support from a woman who was the boss, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of one of my first jobs in an office with a preponderance of men, where I often cried with anger, where I was grabbed by the neck by an older woman – a cold boss, whom I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out onto the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Democratic Congress, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and concluded that she might as well run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very well thought out decision,” she said laughingly to me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the running, and they certainly didn’t need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fundraising, so she promised she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she thought.
When she made a speech about not wanting to run, she was overwhelmed with emotion — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to raise money and reach out to voters instead of electors, and anger over sexism — that she got a lump in her throat.
“You’d think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls of how the press reacted to her.
“You’d think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were loud, and while the battle is far from over, divisions between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week, with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the U.S. all the way, and the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to back down any time soon.
If it makes Washington withdraw its demands, it means that they are giving in, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, US pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
“A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create a breeding ground for an economy that could get out of control in both countries, and it’s actually much more dangerous than was thought,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to accept refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the refugees to return and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government remains in control of the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now in place for the refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011 when the war began.
A further six million people still in the country are in need of emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the ravaged country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that helped support the insurgency.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 and beaten the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari performed well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have scored 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament's current format started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, dropped 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t normally cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It’s a team effort and I’m glad I could help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who felled the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
It’s an odd statistic for one of the best golfers ever to win 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had trouble finding form all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of the guys, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we countered Europe.
We lost.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we will move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were defeated.”
Update on algal bloom: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decreasing algae concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, scattered blooms are reported in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – suggesting that the concentration is decreasing.
The bloom of algae spreads over a 210 km coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are minor blooms about 10 miles (16 km) off the coast in Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
There have also been reports of flooding in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations in or at sea have been reported in Pinellas County during the last week, low to high concentrations in the sea off Hillsborough County, background concentration to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentration to high concentrations in or in the sea off Sarasota County, background concentration to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background concentration to high concentrations in or in the sea off Lee County and low concentrations in Collier.
Breathing difficulties continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory problems in northwest Florida in the past week.
