Shouting at the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland has started well and shouts and calls in the nature have started to pull people far and wide around the world.
<0xC2><0xAB>You own the mystery, I need Iceland,<0xC2><0xBB> says a woman out in the big world in a comment on an ad from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another spectator says he will keep Iceland in his heart forever, and a young woman says she must come to Iceland as soon as her fiancé lives there.
Unfortunately, however, she is in the United States and expects to have to wait a few more months.
Yet another observer asks if the route to Iceland is a good one, because there are no planes.
Don’t worry if it comes from a different time zone.
Egill <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r<0xC3><0xB0>arson at the advertising agency Peel, which was responsible for the advertising together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says that there has been hope for more.
“I came across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
Basically, it’s about creating PR value, it’s getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it’s been going incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in some seven hundred media outlets around the world, totaling more than two billion people.
The value of this discussion is priced at ISK 1.8 billion.
It's not terrible."
The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, even though the Americans are not on their way to the country in the near future.
According to Egil, well-known market areas such as Denmark, the UK and Germany have also been well received, such as Russia, which is pleasantly surprising.
Then there was a reaction from foreign regions, such as India, which was not particularly affected.
“These ads have traveled far beyond our expectations,” says Egill, adding that more than four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
The pictures here at the opening were taken by <0xC3><0x81>rni S<0xC3><0xA6>berg, photographer of Morgunbla<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0>, during the filming of advertisements entitled “Let It Out” in the middle of last month.
The photographs were taken far and wide, such as at Sk<0xC3><0xB3>lavör<0xC3><0xB0>ust<0xC3><0xAD>gur in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, in Reynisfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, at Sk<0xC3><0xB3>garfoss, on S<0xC3><0xB3>lheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöf<0xC3><0xB0>i.
The directors were Sam<0xC3><0xBA>el Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar P<0xC3><0xA1>ll <0xC3><0x93>lafsson at Skoti productions and director <0xC3><0x93>ttar Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason.
The Icelandic actors Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary, were in the film.
Dozens of Icelanders came to make the ads, but at the same time as the recordings took place in South Iceland, there was another group in West Iceland and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, which is planned to be a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for Islandsstofa,” Egill says, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone extremely well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Explosives: Discuss the state of the labor market, pension funds and much more
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, will be in Sprengisand, which starts at 10 a.m. today.
He is also Minister of Labour and discusses the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and the transfer of jobs to a country that has gone badly and been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, chairman of VR, will also attend the show, but he will discuss his criticism of pension fund investments and put forward ideas for trade unions and employers to withdraw from the boards of the funds in order to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
<0xC3><0x8D>var Ingimarsson, a tourism operator in East Iceland, and <0xC3><0x81>rnhei<0xC3><0xB0>ur J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, Managing Director of the North Iceland Marketing Agency, will also discuss the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look ahead to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a deceptive harbinger of what is to come.
Listen to the show below, which starts at 10 a.m.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teen dramas of all kinds.
She gained worldwide fame for her role as Amber in Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has been said about her lately, but she managed to look back and comment on Clueless on Australian television recently.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who passed away unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I mostly based my character on girls I met at school who weren’t very good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that character was,” Donovan said of his performance in Clueless.
I didn’t want to leave the house after a night out.
About fifty cases came on the table of the police in the capital area today and says in the police diary that the cases have been varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to intervene in the case of a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after having stayed there for drunk driving.
The man did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey the instructions of the police who told him to leave.
The man continued to work at the police station because of his actions.
A man was arrested in the morning on suspicion of breaking into a company in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogur.
Police also had to intervene with two men in Brei<0xC3><0xB0>holt due to reports of assault.
A woman who was eating at a grocery store in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogur could not pay for the bill after the meal and was therefore called the police.
There was also a theft of a car in the city this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van searched her for a moment and she was then taken involuntarily.
The car was not found.
The Curse of the Glee Club - Terrible Fate of the Glee Stars
The theory has made its way onto the Internet that a curse rests upon the series' success, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the early days, becoming the third lead actress to die long before her time.
The Glee series is a popular television series about singing, dancing, and joy.
The series revolved around the joys of high school students, their loves, and their fate.
It was not always taken out with the bliss of being in the joyous band, but through song and dance, the characters seemed to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
But outside of the filming location there has been great disaster for the actors and staff of the show, so much so that theories have been raised that a curse rests on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played Santana Lopez, a cheerleader who didn’t call her grandmother.
After the season ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey, with whom she had her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced them.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
Rivera was reported missing on July 8 after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Pira, California.
The boy was found asleep in a life jacket on board the boat, and he was able to tell police that he and his mother had jumped into the water and Rivera had put him back in the boat but never returned there.
There was an extensive search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the local police chief revealed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially pronounced dead.
It is believed that she has been hit by a heavy current in the water and used her last claim to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded as being drowned in an accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played Finn Hudson, the American football player with the voice of an angel who played a key role in honoring the Joy Squad.
On the outside, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues in the show felt that enough was enough, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and everything seemed to look for a better way.
Just two months after completing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out with friends.
Banamein was found to be a lethal combination of drugs and alcohol.
I didn’t think it was a will to talk.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerance to intoxicants had decreased to such an extent that the dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his colleagues, but at the request of his co-star, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue filming the show, devoting them to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow members of the Joy Squad, or even until he had the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of child pornography custody.
When we visited his home, he found a huge amount of child pornography, and the matter was soon publicly discussed.
It was clear that Salling was gone.
He was charged and convicted of his crimes.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison, and would have to be on a list of sex offenders and seek treatment for child abuse.
Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, then released on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It’s not just the actors who have been in the show for a long time.
Jim Fuller was the show's assistant director.
He died suddenly in his sleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
The show also starred a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and did not tell her sister the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great control and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014, suffering from severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé saying that her mother and sister were responsible for how she was treated.
“My mother and so-called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that they caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and bullying her co-stars on set and having a superlative astrology.
Jesse Luken made guest appearances on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
Actress Heather Morris had a major role in the show.
In 2010, she was the subject of naked pictures of her naked body, which were published on the Internet.
Actresses Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both appeared on the show and had an off-season love affair.
Benoist later revealed that Jenner abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
Growing flowers and watching them grow and flourish will increase the development of children when they get to play in the garden with their parents.
It can also be done endlessly with flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Spending time with the kids is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
I bought a boat in the 10th grade.
“I don’t think there are many sailors who work at preschools in Iceland,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, who is engaged in coastal fishing during the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well you can have good income and I think it’s great not to be able to take a student loan.
The income is also good enough for me this winter," says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who is fishing on the coast this summer as well as last summer.
Axel was the first to dock in T<0xC3><0xA1>lknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur when a journalist reached him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.
“The winter I was in the tenth grade, I took a boat charter for boats under twelve meters long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I’ve been fishing on my boat all summer.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jonsson, and I named the boat his name.
Hartmann was an adult when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very happy when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," Axel says, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half of it, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
So I had the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer on it."
But how could a boy have a million and a half to pay off in a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“I’d put in a lot of money, I’d been working with my dad at sea when I was a kid, I was all summer fishing with him and I got my share.
I also put my deposit in my boat fund.”
Axel was born in <0xC3><0x8D>safjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, where all his mother’s people live, but he has lived in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogur since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the western area because I have a legal domicile with my grandmother in <0xC3><0x8D>safjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
I learned about this area from riding with my dad.
I move between fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire Westfjords.
Although I prefer to stay in the west, I have also been around the Sn<0xC3><0xA6>fellsnes peninsula and beyond.
I have also been to the south, but then I prefer mudslides," says Axel, who always catches one early in the morning and says he sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, for hours alone in the baleen sea.
“The internet at sea is good, so I can make phone calls, listen to podcasts and music.
I don’t think it’s okay to be alone in a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly there have been times when something was wrong, but never a great danger,” says Axel, who is lucky in that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the hunt is going.
“In coastal fishing, I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, in which case I have been continuously for a day and a half fishing in the sea.”
According to him, he is allowed to catch 770 kilos a day, which he finds intimidating.
“Other restrictions are that I may not fish Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I may only fish 12 days a month, the four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to row instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to choose according to their head.
So the area could be divided for me as well, and the sea space that is well located by the fishing grounds should be able to enjoy it,” says Axel, who mostly reduces cod from salty seas on his coastal fishing trips, but also only hashish and some other types of rivers with it.
Axel works during the winter with his university studies at the kindergarten N<0xC3><0xBA>pi in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogur.
“I don’t think there are many sailors who work at preschools in Iceland,” Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the preschool.
“I’m here because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that my studies in psychology will be useful for me at the preschool level in the future," says Axel, who also has a long experience in business studies.
An error in the registration prevented the return procedure
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in Iceland resulted in a person living in Iceland not being called back for sampling.
It is not a requirement to register an identification number if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
“We’re going to see it this week,” said a medical examiner.
Three cases of the virus were detected at the National University Hospital of Iceland yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to Iceland on 15 July, two days after the rules on so-called repatriation protocol came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are screened on arrival in Iceland and again invited for sampling four to five days later.
In the afternoon news, however, R<0xC3><0x9A>V reported that the person in question had followed the old system.
The sampling at the border was negative and it was not called back for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigf<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, a specialist in the Department of Epidemiology at the Directorate of Health, says in a conversation with the news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, it is not a requirement to enter an ID number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
This was first and foremost for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned was not automatically invited to take a sample.
Kamilla says that many people have followed the rules on the return portal even though they have filled the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been alert to send people for sampling again after they arrived in the country.
“This week we will look at how to make it easier for people to get their attention in the process.”
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been quarantined.
They all went for a sampling but the two were beginning to show symptoms.
Contagion is now underway for the three infections that were detected yesterday, but it is mostly completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing of Icelandic genetic analyses has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In another case, the ties have focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be clear tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to the web COVID. is.
There are 135 in attendance.
Four out of five infections are unrelated.
Five domestic infections have been detected in Iceland in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and, for example, the source of the infection that emerged at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday has not yet been identified.
Inflection is still ongoing.
Originally there were in the third dozen uniquely sent to quarantine but they were reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 quarantined due to these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that infection is detected at sporting events and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
J<0xC3><0xB3>hann K. J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsson, communications manager at the Civil Protection Department of the National Commissioner of Police, says this is a good thing, as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
“We are constantly reminding all those who live here that we need to maintain individualized infection control.
We also need to remind people who are holding events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
It is possible to have an event," says J<0xC3><0xB3>hann.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping up individual infection control.
In addition, the rules and criteria are in constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Civil Protection and the Medical Director of Health are constantly urging people to do, is to think about these individualized infection control measures.
Both at home and in business.
People should wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents the infection from continuing,” says J<0xC3><0xB3>hann.
“We need to encourage people to continue on the good path we were on in order to continue the progress we have made so far.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard it was for her father to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she urged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory distress due to a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as an underlying problem and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same will happen.
Reuters reported that Brumfield's fears were not unfounded.
According to a new study by the U.S. Department of Health, nearly 40% of people who died from type 2 diabetes were diagnosed with the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion rises to half.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study involved more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, said the results were “stunning,” especially for people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
There was a hidden slow growth in Reuters, and the responses from the 12 countries that responded to the survey showed a similar rate.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet reporting underlying diseases.
“Diabetes was already an epidemic in slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful century,” said Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also progressed worse from the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease under control with exercise, a healthy diet, and the help of a health care professional.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to keep a routine.
In addition, high insulin prices have forced some people to keep going to work, thereby risking exposure to the virus.
Reuters notes that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk that those with type 2 diabetes could be caused by the virus.
At the time of the SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2003, more than 20% of those affected had the disease, and in the 2009 swine flu pandemic, this group was three times more likely to have to go to hospital.
When MERS did this in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a researcher at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus may last longer, the epidemic has removed the veil of numerous previously unknown complications.
“I fear we will see a tidal wave of problems when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, president of the International Association of Diabetics.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic may indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney dialysis.
Similarly, new research suggests that the corona virus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Researchers are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
In addition, a high glucose-lipid ratio in diabetics can induce a true “cytoblastoma,” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
“It’s all one big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
“It’s all interrelated.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were offered champagne, and then they left the room.”
The couple <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and Atli Bollason received an unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was putting on in Paris.
“We loved each other, so it wasn’t difficult.”
Atli Bollison will never forget when he met his wife and mother-in-law, <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>na Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, for the first time.
“I was very attracted to her.
Of course, it was just the light, but I thought it was pretty cool too.
And I still do," he says.
She also remembers the first time her husband met her.
“I always hear this story.
“This is the last time I’m going to do this,” she said, adding that she was also attracted to her husband on her first encounter.
“I felt and feel so much excitement around Atli, which I like.
There’s a lot going on and a lot going on and I’m very excited about it.”
Atli says that the couple have emphasized in their relationship that they should go their own way.
“We don’t tie our bags the same knots as our companions.
We avoid the rutins that we detect around us.”
This is possibly the reason why they took the message from Ragnar Kjartansson the artist, even if it was, to say the least, unusual.
“Krist<0xC3><0xAD>n Anna, our mutual friend, contacts us and asks if we can come to eat desert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg Ragnar’s wife, at Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps, and had desert wines and desserts.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for an art exhibition that he planned to set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
He had a multi-channel video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He said it in a very simple way.”
<0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from everyday life in the West.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in.”
The scene Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was meant to show a young middle-class couple making love in a minimalist room.
“It’s the beginning and the end of the relationship,” says Atli.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar much, even though they knew of him and him, “but they knew us and thought we fit in.
They said they didn’t want to advertise.
Maybe they thought they weren’t getting the right people, but people who were getting sexual masturbators from performing for others.”
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we walked out of Snaps, we were like, ‘Aren’t we just for this?’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his team," says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n and Atli.
“It’s about love and connection.”
He was taken up in a fine apartment on M<0xC3><0xBD>rargata.
There was a very small film crew; a cameraman, Ragnar and a sound engineer and the couple.
After the recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except Atli and <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
“We haven’t decided how we’re going to be.
We were given some instructions, but we tried to forget a time and a place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t difficult,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli, and <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n agrees.
“We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the piece that moved them.
“When Tommi the cameraman looked at it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful,” says Atli.
“It’s as much about love and intimacy as it is about intercourse,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard the voice of his son at the Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to think about it," says Atli.
My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone that, but then my dad sent me a message and said, ‘Nice to meet the little family at the Palais de Tokyo,’” <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n recalls.
Do you think the relationship between <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n and Atli deepened?
“We’re still together, so maybe it’s something deeper.
At least it deepened my relationship with my in-laws,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n and laughs.
He saw the work himself in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I found it a little hard not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just one scene in a much bigger piece and when you saw it with the other pieces, it’s really cool.
I was able to walk away from it and be proud of it.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n, who was pregnant by another of the couple's children when the scene was recorded.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>na and Atli in <0xC3><0x81>sf<0xC3><0xB3>gur p<0xC3><0xA1> R<0xC3><0xA1>s 1.
Swansea win in the first semi-final
Swansea won 1–0 at Brentford in a dramatic game.
It was the first game in the Premier League to reach the semi-finals.
The match took place at Swansea’s home ground in Wales.
The score at half time was 0-0.
The home side in Swansea received a penalty in the 64th minute, while Andre Ayew broke the ball from the penalty spot and defended.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, received the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game less than a man, and in the 82nd minute Swansea players took advantage of the difference.
Andre Ayew improved the score by scoring a fantastic goal and securing Swansea’s 1–0 victory.
Swansea are leading 1–0 in the draw, but the second leg will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
No ambassador for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight after CBS announced this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here in Iceland.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the U.S. embassy in April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from his post under peculiar circumstances, but Kastlj<0xC3><0xB3>s announced in 2009 that she should have received the Order of the Falcon.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the President’s Office that she would not be honored by the word.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor took office in September 2010.
Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador, but then resigned.
Loius Ariega had been in the Foreign Service for decades.
He retired in 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
And then there was another ambassadorial moment.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Senate in January 2015 and took office shortly after, when no U.S. ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee, not a diplomat, but a lawyer and a pro-Barack Obama campaign fund.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is customary with politically mandated ambassadors.
The Trump administration was unable to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in Washington.
Two years passed before the U.S. Congress called for Jeffrey Ross Gunter to ask him questions and confirm that he was ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the parliament, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been of Dutch descent.
Gunter is a political appointee, a former dermatologist in California, and a prominent member of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, but Adelson is an avid supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in Iceland since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest in Iceland.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration was nominating people in key positions, and that in recent years, the work of the U.S. Congress has drawn very long, including the confirmation of an ambassador in office.
Since 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the construction of the embassy, which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction is estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion kronor, but the building is surrounded by solid safety walls and bulletproof glass in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have been enough to fill the current ambassador's sense of security because he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former IBV player was subjected to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former player at <0xC3><0x8D>BV, says he was a victim of racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets having come to the country.
This is according to an interview with Tonny that appeared on the Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland, but he played with <0xC3><0x8D>BV, Val and <0xC3><0x9E>r<0xC3><0xB3>tti in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the midfield like I used to play.
The captain of the team was in that position but he also had the shirt number I wanted so I got neither of the things I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with <0xC3><0x8D>BV.
One of the things that Tonny talks about is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was being said to me.
Later I heard about it and asked my friend what it was about.
He then told me that my opponent made racist comments about me after I tackled him.”
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He has made the mistakes he sees most.
Tonny had not managed to get into the starting team at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity that I wanted to have," Tonny says, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He wants to believe that the loan to Iceland made up for his dreams of becoming a major player in Europe.
He found a snake in a woman’s throat.
Doctors at St. Luke’s International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-cm-long black worm in the neck gland of a woman who sought it.
Doctors managed to pull the worm out with a pair of tongs.
An investigation revealed that a parasite was involved.
CNN reports on it.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, which is thin slices of meat.
The woman soon recovered after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi became popular in the West, cases of parasites have increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is about to start in Europe
Spain is currently in the spotlight in relation to concerns about the second wave of coronavirus in Europe, where the authorities have taken action to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic once again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to go into quarantine on their return from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned about travel to Spain.
Infection is also on the increase in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance to curb the spread of the virus and relaunch the economy.
The situation in Europe is, however, good compared to the rest of the world, but the incidence of infection worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the most infections occurring in America and South Asia.
Globally, the number of confirmed cases is 16 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, and the number of confirmed deaths is 644,000.
The mosaic works of Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ar are finally able to enjoy themselves to the fullest
In front of the Customs House in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k there is a large and deep hole.
There are people with orange helmets.
There is also a graveyard.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the sidewalk is capable, and many now stop and contemplate works of art made from millions of mosaic tiles —as they have never seen them before.
They may have never seen it before.
At least it doesn’t look like it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it were parking lots that were always occupied.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to do their errands in the city center.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Lifelike and diverse public spaces" and <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>attractive city bustle" are guiding principles for the reconstruction of Tryggvagatan that is currently under way.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic work of Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir at Tollh<0xC3><0xBA>si<0xC3><0xB0> to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work there will be a square and since the area is well located by the sun, it is considered suitable as a residential area for pedestrians.
The artwork will be illuminated and the material will now enjoy itself better than before on these 142 square meters.
There will also be small ‘fog sprayers’, a kind of water sculptures, which offer a game and give the area a certain mystique.
In this way, the improvements are described by the City of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, which is in the process of being implemented together with Veitur Utilities.
The water, heating and electricity supply lines will be renewed.
Many of them have come of age, but the sewage and cold water pipes are from 1925 and have served residents and businesses in the city center for almost a century.
When the street is reopened, cars can drive around it again.
But it will be a one-way street and at the same time create a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians.
According to information about the Customs House on the Customs Manager's website, the house was taken into use in 1971, and its architect was G<0xC3><0xAD>sli Halld<0xC3><0xB3>rsson.
Because a harbour wall penetrated the building, a 250-square-metre windowless wall was created on the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a surface would have a negative impact on the overall streetscape, if special measures were not taken to decorate the appearance of the building.
The parties therefore agreed to expect permanent works of art to be installed there.
During this time, a great deal of talk was said about Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an artist, in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaics in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to first contact her before deciding whether to hold a competition for the work.
It had often been said that the work needed to reflect life at the harbour, as the harbour had been the lifeblood of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k since it was made.
When she spoke to the artist, she became enamored with such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur got the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home she made some suggestions for discussion.
I immediately asked her to do the job.
Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur had long worked with her and the famous German art company, the Oidtmann Brothers, to set up famous works of art in many parts of Europe.
Agreements were reached and Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur worked on the artwork during the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of the installation of the Customs House.
All the work was done exceptionally well, both by Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and Oidtmannbr<0xC3><0xA6><0xC3><0xB0>ra, says the summary.
Since then, it’s been snowing in the Swiss Alps.
It took about two years to complete the work, which was completed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the work was completed, at the age of 47.
Preparing for the transfer of more institutions to the country
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be moved to Iceland in the near future.
This is what the minister said in the episode Explosives at the Wave at lunchtime.
It was recently announced that the Department of Fire and Civil Engineering will be moving north to Sau<0xC3><0xB0><0xC3><0xA1>rkr<0xC3><0xB3>kur in the autumn.
Six fire experts work for the agency, none of whom intends to follow the agency north, and the National Fire Brigade and Medical Transport Association has criticised the relocation.
“I think we need to take another step in that direction.
I am preparing a further step in this journey.
Further transport," said <0xC3><0x81>smundur.
He said he is convinced that the vast majority of the population wants to see more distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public jobs out on land, as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Institute,“ said <0xC3><0x81>smundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred out on land and were of great importance to communities in the country, such as the transfer of the Food and Veterinary Authority to Selfoss, the National Survey of Iceland to Akra.
All the best from the second day of the Masters Tournament
The 94th Icelandic Championships in Athletics ended at <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvöllur in Akureyri today.
There were a few matches on the second day of the race.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s J<0xC3><0xB3>nsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from FH set the Icelandic record in 2014 which lasted until Elisabeth Rut R<0xC3><0xBA>narsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from <0xC3><0x8D>R improved the record in May last year.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in fantastic shape lately, but she has tripled Iceland’s record for the rest of the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injuries and didn’t make it today.
She only had one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and at the same time set a meeting record.
Her Icelandic record she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters, so she was somewhat away from it.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Kar<0xC3><0xAD>tas Hallgr<0xC3><0xAD>msd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from <0xC3><0x8D>R had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best result with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, the FH-ing Hilmar <0xC3><0x96>rn J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson, Iceland's record holder in the hammer throw, won a safe victory but he threw 73.84 meters in his next to last throw and set a tournament record.
His Icelandic record in the article is 75.26 meters.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>ni Valur Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason, Olympian and Icelandic record holder in the round, won a competition in a ball projector at <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvöllur yesterday but today he competed in the round, which is his main discipline.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>ni Vals’ Iceland record is 65.53 meters but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdemar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today, but he had one valid throw that was enough for the 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>ard<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, Iceland’s record holder in long jump, won the long jump competition with superiority but Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s jumped the longest 6.25 meters today which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women’s 200 meter race, it was the Irishman Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na Bjarnad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir who was the fastest, but she came in 24.04 seconds and her Iceland record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na was successful in Akureyri but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meters and in the 4 x 100 meters relay and then also in the 4 x 400 meters relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Hödur Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 metres in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of <0xC3><0x93>liver M<0xC3><0xA1>ni Sam<0xC3><0xBA>elsson from <0xC3><0x81>rmann.
Like Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na, Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters race.
No fine for $27 million Bitcoin harvest
The IRS has rejected a claim by a tax investigator that demanded a fine against a person for underreporting their capital income that was generated by the sale of the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.
The Committee concludes that the Director of Tax Investigations had not provided a clear argument as to why it was necessary to fine the man.
The committee’s ruling states that the director of tax investigations considered the man to have submitted materially incorrect tax returns for the 2016 and 2017 income years.
He would have defaulted on his capital gains resulting from the sale of the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin up to 27 million, either intentionally or out of gross negligence.
Charged the man for his conduct.
He refused to do so in a letter to the committee.
However, he managed to sell cryptocurrencies for 27 million in 2016.
She would have been buried in 2009 and 2010 when this would have been both easy and unattended with a normal home computer.
He also pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrencies, the tax implementation for such sales had been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been impossible to expect the general public to be aware of such measures on a tax return.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have accounted for his property on the tax return as a deposit in the currency account.
He had asked both experts and the governor how this was done, but without success.
Then he thought that it would be necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have had a clear view of.
The man considered it right that his taxes for these two income years would be re-determined and the burden applied, but in other respects no punishment would be imposed.
He also stated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to get away from his responsibilities in an improper way.
The demand for a fine was out of all measure and would plunge him into debt.
He said, “This guy knows what football is.
Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfur Andersen Willumsson has been quite a bit between people’s teeth but also impressed by his performance during the season with Brei<0xC3><0xB0>ablik in the Pepsi Max league.
They’re going to be in the spotlight tonight when they get to play the game on the big screen.
Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfur will then be banned from playing due to four reminders during the season and will therefore not show up with a new haircut as in the summer games so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his head before the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was replying to with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was even more trying in the game.
He did not go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was someone going to level this game then I thought he would do it or make it,” said Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stand, when Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfur was said to have arrived.
“I’m here for the people.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to know where he is.
He looks a little to the left when the games start, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Hafli<0xC3><0xB0>ason.
<0xC3><0x9E>orkell M<0xC3><0xA1>ni Pétursson tells Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf a real entertainer and is pleased to have such a colorful man in the department: “No one shares that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to show up and answer interviews.
There are a lot of people who care about him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“I am an entertainer.
I’m supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf, people are paying their way in and watching what’s next on his hair.
“This guy is a genius,” he said.
"I want to leave the club - I've been in contact with a few teams in the B-League.
Tobias Thomsen, a member of the Pepsi Max squad, is leaving the team.
According to Danish broadcaster Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the incident.
Tobias wants to reach the start of the season in his home country, but for that he must first terminate his contract with KR where the Danish league starts before that Icelandic probability.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias told Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in the B-League and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay up my contract with KR.”
He said he will probably have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably experienced more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Hj<0xC3><0xB3>lahv<0xC3><0xAD>slarinn Bjartmar has recovered bikes for millions - Answers now for themselves after the review DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Le<0xC3><0xB3>sson has had interests unlike most others.
He sniffs up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, e-bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name "The Wheel Whisperer" for the last time.
Yesterday there was a lot of uproar when you published a story about your relationship with Bjartmar.
The DV then referred to a discussion on the Facebook group of Vesturb<0xC3><0xA6>ir, where it was stated that Bjartmar had taken the man to Austurvöllur and said the wasp might have been stolen.
There was nothing else that could be read from the original writings of the electric shuttleman but that Bjartmar had stolen him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original news of the case is not at all descriptive of what really went on yesterday in Austurvöllur.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victims of the electric shuttle bulletins that these were indeed his electric shuttles.
The information received the alleged owner from others, but the information turned out to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“I looked at the guy and I checked the shuttle, and there was information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and that was being searched.
I hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to drive off on the shuttle, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his guilt, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word out of me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
"Yes, fine," said Bjartmar, "let's just get it straight."
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the owner of the electric shuttle told his story on Facebook, as reported in an earlier story.
Over the past year or so, Bjartmar has engaged in this practice, saying that he can count the time he ended up at odds with people on the fingers of one hand.
“I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k,” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bike thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, mentally disabled people and other people who for some reason are on the street.
“The addiction is a hard master and somehow needs to be financed the next round, unfortunately the theft of such movable assets is an easy way to that end,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationship with these people is so good that I’ve brought a lot of good people with me.
“I’ve had people come to me and help me with what I’m doing,” he said.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with bikers is polite.
Some people know about him and what he is doing, and they peacefully offer to show him receipts, wheel registration numbers, and so on.
Bike theft is a major problem that has received little attention.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police have even begun to point out people to talk to him because of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is unhappy with the previous news coverage of DV and says he is not some sort of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
When asked if he is still not on the slippery slope with his actions, and if this is not the first and foremost role of the police, Bjartmar says it certainly is.
"Of course the police are supposed to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are not really doing this.
I have for example watched the policemen run away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She’s totally clueless about these things.”
“When the police aren’t doing anything about it, and it’s just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, why not?”
He says he has achieved so much success in keeping track of stolen bikes, that sometimes he comes across his "clients" on the street that they just had the right Bjartmar wheels they had previously recovered in.
The time that Bjartmar has called for help from the police has come when she simply does not show up.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the bike owners’ fault,” Bjartmar said, and regrets that the victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from the indifference of the police in this area.
The success of Bjartmar is not shared.
You can find many stories of people thanking Bjartmar for having gotten their belongings back.
Bjartmar says he has long lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts probably run in the millions, if not millions of days.
Weighing there electric scooters, electric bikes and electric scooters heavy, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works during the day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a co-housing.
His bike search is therefore unpaid work that he does in his free time.
Life and Long Shadows
2019 was a big anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had, admittedly, received a pension from the Danish king all the way from the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all public employees.
The basis for the current pension funds of general wage earners was then laid by collective wage agreements in the labour market in 1969, which provided for occupational pension funds with compulsory membership and a full fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, legislation was passed on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to strengthen thereafter.
The workers’ pension system was not the only radical change that the labour movement of the 20th century pushed forward with its wage struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in historic strike conflicts in 1955, and the organization also gradually got its demands on sickness rights and sickness funds, significant vacation rights, shortening of working hours, improvements in housing issues and more as a great deal of time.
All these rights required a great and rigorous struggle, but in hindsight they proved to be much greater and more permanent benefits than the increase in the amount of money in the wage envelope, which, as many remember, disappeared just as hard in the wake of inflation, which characterised the period after the war and up to 1990.
The preparation for the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although the men finally agreed that the funds would in fact be the property of fund members, the trade union movement had to agree that their boards should be appointed equal representatives of employers and fund members.
In the years following the foundation of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers on the board of the funds was often discussed in the unions of employees, but it never succeeded, and therefore we are still faced with the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the fund members are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.
Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It says in point 1 that "the pension fund shall be guided by the interests of fund members."
It also states in point 5: “The Pension Fund shall set ethical standards for its investments.”
The Shareholders’ Policy of the Merchants’ Pension Fund includes the following provisions, further to the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations’ (UN PRI) Code of Conduct for Responsible Investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the West Sea and Europe.
The rules discuss how an emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improved investment performance of securities portfolios.
In this way, the interests of investors and the objectives of society are brought together in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those listed on the stock market, establish a public policy of: to maintain good corporate governance for social responsibility and environmental issues.
The pension fund Gildi, which is one of the country’s largest funds, has established a “policy on responsible investment” and contains provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest Icelandic fashion word, “shadow management”.
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it has been defined in full, but I think the following definition is now "most taken": Shadow management is when a leader in a union says in the media that he intends to send the company's representatives on the board of a pension fund recommendations or instructions on how to take a position in a particular case.
If they fail to do so, they will be removed from office at the earliest opportunity.
If the leader does not put this in the media and does not talk about termination, then it is not "shadow management" as such communication between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about which way he feels "shadowed."
There are mainly two people who have tried to formulate this definition as of this writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hör<0xC3><0xB0>ur <0xC3><0x86>gisson, journalist at Fréttabla<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0>, and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson, Governor of the Central Bank.
The occasion for both of them came about after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company’s agreements with flight attendants and flight attendants (dismiss them), and Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, chairman of the Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k Chamber of Commerce, sent them out with recommendations to the company’s representatives on the board of L<0xC3><0xAD>feyrisssj<0xC3><0xB3><0xC3><0xB0>ur <0xC3><0xB0>ur <0xC3><0xB0>i <0xC3><0xB0>i <0xC3><0xB0>ar <0xC3><0xB0>i <0xC3><0xB0>ar <0xC3><0xB0>i <0xC3><0xB0>ar <0xC3><0xB0>ar <0xC3><0xB0>ar
A few years later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and subsequently Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r went the same way with his recommendations, which were of course based on Bogi’s decision.
Nevertheless, Hör<0xC3><0xB0>ur and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir saw reason to talk about the matter in the Friday newspaper Fréttabla<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0> with big words about shadow management, violations of the law and the need for changes in the law.
There, a small dozen were indeed to roll a heavy load, even though the blessed dozen had been in a state of attachment and had also been quickly dried out.
Since the matter is important, let’s consider the subject itself in the end.
I’ve already mentioned some of the legal issues that come up in this case.
This means that fund boards are to safeguard the interests of fund members and have ethical standards in investments, and these issues are elaborated in more detail in the Articles of Association of both the Valid and the Merchant Pension Fund, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, on the other hand, should NOT only look at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
Such a course would be extremely dangerous, and it is not necessary to look for examples of such a course in the past, as large loans from banks and funds have flowed to immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on the slippery slope when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis investors.
Luckily, he saw it and took it back.
Time will tell whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered responsible to the fund members in the end.

One of the infected persons did not practice homeopathic medicine
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic States on 15 July, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not normally resident here and therefore did not receive clear instructions to use so-called repatriation surveillance after his arrival in Iceland and to undergo another sampling a few days after his arrival.
He got a negative from the border screening.
“But he’s in Icelandic society and he’s really meant to go to that resort,” says Kamilla J<0xC3><0xB3>sepsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, a specialist in the field of epidemiology at the Medical Director of Health and a deputy epidemiologist while he’s on holiday, in a conversation with Fréttabla<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0> today.
"He used the English form of registration and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the docent is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the second sample."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he actually resides abroad, but because of his network in the country as an Icelander, he would have preferred to use the Icelandic one.
But he did not realize this.
“When the kennel is not registered, you have to seek it out yourself for the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realised that this was the right way to go about it,” says Kamilla.
“So it is clear that we need to strengthen the disclosure of information about this while we find some way to make an automatic system of preaching even if Icelanders do not register their ID number.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are participants in the Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, few people interacted with the person on arrival in Iceland, although he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, a resident of Iceland.
Only six have been sent to quarantine since he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in contact with him.
Two of them have been diagnosed with Covid-19.
The man received a negative from his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says she was so newly infected that she was not yet able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man has been infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
“It is not entirely possible to argue that this is definitely an imported infection because it has been so long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little bit of a fuss in relation to the sporting events.”
She says it’s very unlikely because of how few people there are.
“It’s actually very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but points out that it can’t be ruled out until Icelandic genetic testing has sequenced the virus in the human.
“If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he brought it to the country.”
Whistleblowers and bombs used against Protestants
Police clashed with protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and lethal grenades, but protesters broke windows and set fire to them.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racism were protested across the United States last night in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the suspect has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protest.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
Police said the protests were a riot, and clashes between protesters and police ensued.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of National Guardsmen came together to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman murdered by police at her home in March.
The group carried firearms and marched in groups to closed intersections, where police tied the group to a group of protestors who also carried firearms.
Seventy-five people were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bartender in May.
Solskjaer: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r, Manchester United’s manager, does not want to make too much of the importance of today’s game at Leicester in the final round of the Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, Solskjaer and his men end up in 5th place and lose the Champions League seat.
However, they still have a chance to win the Champions League next month.
“We’re not at the end of the line.
“If we get a point against Leicester, I think people will say we haven’t had a bad season,” Solskjaer said.
“But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of ground to cover the two teams above us,” Solskjaer said.
It is clear that the nerves of men will be tensed at 3 p.m. today, but Solskjaer tried to pretend that it was a different game.
“If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is the foundation of the company.
We have created a great opportunity to finish the season well and now it is up to us to make the most of it," said Solskjaer.
“It’s not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results don’t define our period, we’ve already had many hours defining this period.”
"The arrival of Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think we are in much better shape and much stronger mentally than last season," Solskjaer said.
65,000 infections per day
A total of 65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 cases have been confirmed since the beginning of the epidemic in Iceland.
900 people died from the virus yesterday, but in the four days leading up to that, deaths from the virus were more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to the U.S. National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of deaths from the virus will reach 175,000 on August 15.
Fear the second wave of the epidemic
The Spanish government is now trying to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more have been detected in 24 hours since the beginning of May, and the news comes at the same time as the Spaniards begin to lift one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
As a result of the recession, the British government forced passengers arriving from Spain to quarantine on their return.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is even worse in Catalonia, in the north-east of Spain, where the government has taken more stringent measures to curb growth.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and wave houses will be closed at midnight.
A curfew has been imposed on 200,000 residents of Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly played after the epidemic.
Tui, the UK’s largest travel agent, cancelled all flights scheduled for today’s flights to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be in resuming a massive curfew that has devastated the economy.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for example, has taken a very bad view of this and compared it to a nuclear weapon that he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the nation “would not survive, economically or socially,” if a national curfew were reinstated.
Many councillors hope that local resources that reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities or areas will be enough to hold back the virus in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three in Iceland
Three cases of internal infection were detected yesterday, as well as two more in addition to the border.
Five individuals with a positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
According to a statement from the Icelandic Civil Protection, one of the infections is related to the infection that was reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k and, according to the report, is “only a part of the sports team” in quarantine.
Others who were sent were in quarantine related to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and infection is detected in full swing by the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police.
The organisers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and rules of the Icelandic Antiseptics and Civil Protection that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of the tournament yesterday attracted attention where one could see in a very close community to celebrate the good fortune of his team out on the field.
Just before 11 a.m., the organizers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
Note: Parents, please respect the rules that competitors pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents are not allowed to do this.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday but is related to the infection that was reported the day before.
According to the announcement, “Icelandic genetic testing has sequenced the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.”
Work is being done on tracing the infection in that case as well, and the person is infected in isolation and 12 in quarantine because of the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, on 15 July.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already beginning to show symptoms of viral infection.
In addition, two people were identified at the border and are awaiting the results of further investigations, such as a work process for borderline infections.
Finally, the report states: The Department of Civil Protection of the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police and the Directorate of Health urge people to exercise caution and pay close attention to individual infection control.
If there is the slightest doubt as to whether the symptoms of Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to take a sample at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur camp site is booked for the weekend of the shopkeepers
The camp site in Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur is fully booked this weekend, according to Vesturbygg<0xC3><0xB0>.
Guests are advised to check other accommodations.
Names Vesturbygg<0xC3><0xB0> B<0xC3><0xAD>ldudalur, T<0xC3><0xA1>lknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, Melanes <0xC3><0xA1> Rau<0xC3><0xB0>asandi, H<0xC3><0xB3>tel Fl<0xC3><0xB3>kalund and H<0xC3><0xB3>tel Brei<0xC3><0xB0>av<0xC3><0xAD>k as other options in the position.
There is enough to be in Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur this weekend, because as in previous years, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic documentaries, will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a tradition in the city.
From an application to the camp site one can expect a good attendance this year, if the weather does not put a line in the account, as DV said earlier today from a disorganized forecast.
Expect the worst weather in the world and the worst weather in the world.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodation in the town was already fully booked.
The entire apartment building is in the best location in the city.
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18–20.
Meanwhile, owners are seeking a building permit for renovation, but their case has been popular in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, there is a large apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor there is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house is a door with two stairways, each of which contains four rather modest apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square metres, although most are over 100 square metres.
The house has a story to tell.
It was built in 1959 and has, among other things, hosted a video rental, Skostofan, Mj<0xC3><0xB3>lkursamsalinn’s dairy shop, J<0xC3><0xB3>a gunsmith, fish sales and most recently H<0xC3><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xB3>labrent.
The house has, to put it mildly, remembered its fool prettier.
The house is now under heavy damage, as can be seen in the accompanying photos.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are among others Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sson and Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Helga L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir.
Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s was a member of Borgun’s ownership group and was the chairman of Borgun’s holding company.
The owners of Borgun Holding Company are St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf.
St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf. is the investment company of Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Helga L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and her children.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n is also the owner of one-third of D18 ehf.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n and her husband, <0xC3><0x81>g<0xC3><0xBA>st Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>sson, once operated the St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little that nothing has been maintained since then.
Neighbors say the building’s condition has deteriorated steadily since then, though mostly in recent years.
On a Facebook page, one resident said the house had “not been very lively in the last year.”
It may be that the owners have been trying for a few years to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house for a long time has not been okay.
"It's time to do something nice about this spot and it's boring that it's been dragged out like that."
He also says that he is angry with the owners of the house for not having the energy to finish this, found some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopped this "lawsuit".
“Just do it in partnership with the community so you can get on with it and finish it.”
The ‘legislative document to which the equipment refers is the planning process of the field which has been in operation since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 sought permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new lift house and an extension on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for this project was appealed to the Environment and Natural Resources Appeals Committee and the Committee repealed it, as the project was not supported by a divisional plan and local information was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k then started with divisional planning work and concluded it with an advertisement in the Official Gazette in July last year.
That plan was also appealed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house at the start of the construction.
By this time, the house had fallen into disrepair and the neighbors began to get tired.
When I asked the neighbors about the house, they responded in a variety of ways.
Some understood the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not at all.
Some people are angry at the city, others are not.
Others were angry, but not at anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was a hassle, while neighbours have used unused Dunhaga 18-20 parking spaces for their vehicles.
One of the plaintiffs in the case said that he was tired of the administration:
“To have to go through the process three times is absolutely incredible.
It’s as if the city of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k couldn’t read.”
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the city’s state-of-the-art administration and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work that are now at the starting point.
When a journalist ran into a garden at Dunhagi 18, a door opened wide and there were piles of rubbish.
A PlayStation computer and a recent television were among the debris on Earth —the victims of the Icelandic summer sorghum.
It was open in the old office of H<0xC3><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xB3>larprent and there were a lot of cats from the smell of urine to judge.
Clearly, someone has nested around him in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of couches and beds and a few pallets of geological pages, which were no doubt to be turned into a book, we blushed.
The stairs of the apartment building were equally open and life in them both.
A reporter was lucky enough to meet one of them.
There were Romanians cooking their own potato dishes for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the employment agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and copy DV’s sources that the company has paid nothing for the premises except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not advisable to collect rent.
From the background of the mail in the front door of the house, it is clear that there have been a lot of foreign workers living there in the last few years.
The operation of temporary employment agencies has not been spared from the Covid-19 situation, as a contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction sector, and these two industries have been most diligent in taking advantage of temporary employment agencies’ services.
Nevertheless, householders at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do and hung up the work clothes and mittens in the common area to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist said goodbye to the boys in Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, 1,500 square meters of real estate is being demolished.
The owners want to change the house for the better and the neighbors want to improve the situation while arguing about the definition of “improvement”.
In between, the city’s planning area sits at the starting point, the victim of endless appeals and appeals in the planning process, and the state-of-the-art resolution of the Environment and Natural Resources Appeals Committee.
In the house there are so many Romanian workers, perhaps the very ones who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article originally appeared in the July 17th issue of DV.
In an anti-obesity campaign following a coronavirus pandemic
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide <0xC2><0xA3>10 million in a weight-loss campaign, which will include a ban on fast-food advertising, following his severe illness, partly due to his weight.
It is expected that Johnson will introduce the campaign, which has been named Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their clients in overweight conditions and will also be engaged in efforts to increase the number of cycling paths.
Advertising on TV will be banned before 9 p.m., according to media reports.
"COVID-19 has alerted us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods," the government said in a statement.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly because of his weight that he is considered to have fallen so seriously.
Women are more likely to lead the change.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step the nation could take towards greater distribution of power, transparency and combating corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gears a little bit now and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group in society that is easier to be in these values.
“They’re women,” she said.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s solidarity.
Stand together and work together to make change.
Now it’s up to us to make these changes.”
She said she was a bit worried about the emphasis on Iceland as “the best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not quite ready to see what we have to do.
As Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we’re coming from and listen to the story.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
“We don’t all have the same rules,” she said.
When asked, she said that women were in many respects in good shape in Iceland, but added that, as in many other places, Icelanders were built on extremely masculine values.
She said that politics revolved around self-interest, domination and power, which were the forces that perpetuated inequality in all societies.
“Women have now formed this group and are coming together and are just a little annoyed that the Althingi is going to try to ignore this referendum from 2012,” she said.
“That’s the kind of woman I’m thinking of.
From the point of view of human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and the fact that we are all really sitting at the same table,” she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country with natural resources and it’s ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can change differently," said Helga.
“It’s ridiculous that there’s any natural law that women’s jobs are always lower paid.
It’s ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to fight the hard way just to get decent wages.”

Tried to steal a pedestrian in the center of town
A man was arrested in the downtown area last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in <0xC3><0x81>rb<0xC3><0xA6>r, where two people were arrested for the case.
The police then stopped the driver of a motorcycle on the slopes, where the driver was at a speed of 146 km/h, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough turning in the night and there were over 80 cases recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise because of the noise.
As of Saturday afternoon, there were reports of eleven noisy gatherings, which was widely reported in the police diary.
Last night, 22 police officers were called to the scene.
Six of them were in jail last night.
Police were called to the scene last night when firefighters fired fireworks.
They had already fled when police arrived.
Nine drivers were arrested for drug and alcohol use.
Four people were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, but one of them was kept in a prison cell.
Two were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in Vesturb<0xC3><0xA6>r.
One person was transferred to an accident department after he was injured jumping on a trampoline in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a caravan on Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police's diary, the trailer was in "very bad condition" and it was immobilized.
You can stay in Monet’s house during the shopping weekend
The house where Claude Monet spent the last 40 years of his life is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next few nights in the house will be the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
In the house there are three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If you want to rent a house, you have to rent it for at least two nights.
Compared to Airbnb’s site, it’s next available after a week, on Sunday of the shopping weekend, and so it might be ideal for some shoppers on vacation to rush into booking the painter’s house.
The two nights over the weekend cost only 964 US dollars or just over 130,000 Icelandic kr<0xC3><0xB3>nur, depending on what Fréttabla<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0> gets next.
Dozens in quarantine and several of them are beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in Iceland in the last three days, and most of them are not related to the virus.
Dozens have been quarantined for this reason, and some of them are beginning to show signs of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus at home yesterday and two at border screening.
An expert at the Directorate of Health says that a growing number of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely in society.
“The previous domestic infection has been sequenced and there is a virus that has not been seen here before so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just come to Iceland, but of course we need to be very vigilant now,” said Kamilla Sigr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xB0>ur Josefsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, a specialist in the Department of Epidemiology at the Directorate of Health.
Most of the infected people have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will take place in the near future, but some who were in contact with the infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no influenza and less other respiratory infections, so we can be pretty liberal about doing these tests on people who, during the flu season, would have found a reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Infectious disease is largely complete, but it is not impossible that more people will need to be quarantined.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
It has raised the question of whether it is reasonable to hold such events.
The Civil Protection Officer says it well slow as long as people follow the norms and rules.
Kamilla says that it is almost impossible that the infected were infected at the sports tournaments.
“If there are not more people going into isolation from these individuals after having spent time with them at these sporting events, then we can claim that our anti-sickness measures at the tournaments have worked.
But it’s not clear,” Kamilla said.
The Department of Civil Protection’s procedures are under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if that seems warranted,” Kamilla said.
In less than a week, the population limit will be increased to 1,000 people.
This new position may have an impact on relaxation.
"Cooking" - See the menu of El<0xC3><0xAD>sa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>ar
El<0xC3><0xAD>sa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>arsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir is an accomplished woman in football and plays with Val.
She is also a master’s student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day and usually makes time to cook good and nutritious food.
“A normal day for me starts at eight,” she said.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at the kindergarten at three o’clock.”
Elisa finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in the kindergarten.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice later.
After the exercise, it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to empty the mind."
Elisha does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her Master’s thesis in Nutrition and therefore knows well what suits her to eat in order to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercise.
“What suits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fat.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food as bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritionally deficient.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time.”
Elisha has a keen interest in cooking.
“I like to think about cooking in the kitchen a lot.
I have to say that my self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I truly believe that I am a good cook.”
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Eat this meal with whatever you have.
Most often it is a banana and crispy muesli & COFFEE.
I am a big coffee drinker.
Between meals: Unbelievably varied, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, pure skyr with banana and musli, bread with toppings and then I could eat hummus with a spoon up from the box if necessary.
Lunch: I often prepare all kinds of tasty salads from what’s in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel buns, rock salad, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing is something I’m working on.
If the organization goes completely out of control (which happens often) then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and then it is 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled eggs, do not put more on you.
Intermediate: Get me something carb-rich for exercise, bread with toppings, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflict Between Police and Protesters in Seattle
The city of Seattle, Washington, has declared a state of emergency following mass protests in the city centre.
Yesterday, police seized flare bombs and pepper spray to try to clear a large area occupied by the protesters, which stretched across several blocks near the parliament building in the city.
Police announced on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into a vandalism that took place at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
City and police officials say protesters stoned police with rocks, bottles, explosives and other movable objects, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where he was injured.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was intended to show solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, a city that has repeatedly been the scene of fierce clashes between protesters and the heavily armed federal police force.
There, as in other U.S. cities, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, recalling George Floyd, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding remedial action.
Do not withdraw until after the vote.
It is not yet known whether the resignations of Icelandair’s flight attendants, which are due to take effect at the end of the month, will be revoked.
An electronic vote on the collective wage agreement of the Icelandic Flight Attendant Association on behalf of flight attendants at Icelandair will end tomorrow at noon.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, chairman of the company, is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the termination until the outcome of the vote is known.
“It’s a perfect fit,” says Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney.
“There have been no redundancies, this must be put in place so that the machines can be manned.
It’s hard for people to know if they’ll be able to get a job after the end of the month.”
The deal was signed last week, on July 19.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that flight attendants had previously voted on.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Board of Trustees of the Icelandic Flight Attendant Association agreed to call for an all-military work stoppage at Icelandair, and the members agreed to do so in a vote.
It never came to Iceland, but this was decided following Icelandair’s decision to discontinue negotiations with Flugfreyfélagi<0xC3><0xB0>, terminate all of its flight attendants and seek agreements with another union.
The company’s pilots were then to take on the work of insuring personnel on board temporarily.
When asked how she thinks the vote will go, Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney finds it difficult to say.
“People are hurt by this action by Icelandair, when all of the company’s flight attendants were dismissed and informed that another union would be formed.
“We’ll see if it has any impact,” she said.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their period of notice varies, for those who have the shortest working lives, it is three months and therefore ends around the end of July-August.
This group comprises about 90% of Icelandair’s flight attendants.
What happens if the agreement is not approved?
“We are looking forward to continuing discussions with our partners.
With this agreement, we are meeting the demands of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants have gone too far.”
Voting on collective agreement closes and Icelandair announces second quarter results tomorrow
The pilot’s vote on the new collective agreement will end at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair’s results for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the company’s income has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic vote on the collective agreement between Icelandair Flight Attendant and the Confederation of Icelandic Employers began on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday, 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who can vote on the agreement are employees of Icelandair who pay membership fees to the Flight Attendant Association.
Icelandair and FF<0xC3><0x8D> signed a new collective wage agreement on Sunday, July 19th, but on Friday, Icelandair had broken off talks with the company after the flight attendants cancelled the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had told all of its flight attendants and flight crew on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
Under the new collective agreement, flight attendants have to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The collective wage agreement is valid until 2025, but it has integrated provisions for pilots and flight attendants on how long they can fly on one shift.
The agreement was presented to members of FF<0xC3><0x8D> at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and described many flight attendants who were discussed by the news agency about their dissatisfaction with the agreement.
However, most of them seemed to agree that it was necessary to accept the agreement in order to keep FF<0xC3><0x8D> alive.
Icelandair’s financial results for the second quarter will be presented tomorrow, but EBIT of the company, its operating profit for financial items and taxes, is, according to preliminary operating results, negative by USD 100 to 110 million or about ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the Stock Exchange last Wednesday, saying that the company’s revenues amounted to about USD 60 million in the quarter, or about ISK 8.3 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents amounted to approximately USD 154 million at the end of the quarter, about ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair also plans to offer the company’s share capital in August.
Icelandair plans to conclude agreements with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before the public offer is made.
A new strain rather than a new type of virus
“A new virus just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been happening in Iceland,” says M<0xC3><0xA1>r Kristj<0xC3><0xA1>nsson, chief physician at Landsp<0xC3><0xAD>tali University Hospital’s infectious disease department, about the news that a “new type of virus” has been detected in Iceland.
Three cases were identified yesterday and two at the border.
One person who was diagnosed had participated in a sports club on the football team Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection is unknown and an infection tracking is ongoing.
A person who came to Iceland on July 15th and two people who were in contact with him started to show symptoms of COVID-19.
A new strain of the virus was identified yesterday, which is related to the infection reported the previous day, and after sequencing at the Icelandic Genetics Institute, it was found that "a new type of virus has not been detected here before."
Infectious disease is over in relation to that infection.
It is not a new virus, but rather the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new strain of the virus than about a new type of virus.
When asked what this means and whether it could indicate that another wave of epidemics has started, M<0xC3><0xA1>r says that it is currently a single case and it could go so that nothing more can be done about it.
“However, if there are cases in Iceland that do not have connections from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then it would be possible to draw that conclusion [on the second wave], but it is premature at the moment,” explains M<0xC3><0xA1>r.
Blessings in the Hot Tub
Is the secret to happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC’s programmers are leading the way in a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique on a global scale and it is claimed that nowhere in the world are there as many bathing places per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal energy is its foundation, but also the tradition of swimming that prevails here.
Children’s swimming lessons were legalized in 1940, but older citizens are no less eager to use the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as a fixed part of the general well-being of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
People talk to each other on their mobile phones on personal notes around the world or enjoy the soothing power of water: meditating on and charging the batteries of the soul and body.
I'm going to spend 100 days in the polls.
It’s a hundred days until the United States goes to the polls and elects a four-year president.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he has yet to win.
Joe Biden, a candidate for the Democratic Party, has a big advantage over Trump at the national level, according to polls.
According to a recent AP News poll, the record number of Americans believes the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump’s response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also very unpopular, and more Americans than ever think the president has been unfaithful to the economy.
In fact, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
Thirty-two percent say they support Trump’s response to the pandemic, and 48 percent say he has kept up with the economy.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden is followed by 49.9 percent nationally while Trump is followed by 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has sought to shift attention away from his performance against the epidemic to Biden, promoting so-called cultural disputes and publicizing policies that are supposed to be about law and order.
Biden’s campaign, however, is focused on keeping Trump in the spotlight and has a high chance of winning if the election is really about how Trump has performed in the last four years.
Unpopular Trump also seems to be planning to bring down Republican lawmakers, fearing Democrats might even gain a majority in the Senate, which so far has been very hopeful.
Politico said last week that it would continue to support parties and candidates alike, and that the Republican Party would suffer its worst defeat in decades.
The environment has been particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now it looks like that trend will continue.
Trump has in recent days tried to intimidate the population of the suburbs to follow him, including by saying that becoming President of the United States, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and foment racial tensions.
Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from Barack Obama’s time in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then urged “housewives” of suburban America to read an article by the former Assistant Secretary of State of New York, in which she claimed that Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States and endorsed Trump.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better,” he said.
The U.S. population is an ever-growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who received the majority of the vote has become president.
In 2012, Mitt Romney won a majority of the vote, but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that while Trump narrowly secured a majority in the 2016 suburbs, his support there has dwindled significantly.
Despite differences in the polls, Biden has recommended a 15-percent advantage over Trump in recent polls.

Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only World War II has precipitated to date, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic flame would be the "light at the end of the corridors," presumably referring to the coronavirus pandemic that the world is now going through.
Successful people have years to prepare, and the Japanese authorities are adding to the cost of the delay.
Everyone has a lot on their plate.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would host this year’s Olympic Games, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They alternately cried and laughed, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games, but that time they bowed to Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan would bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled for July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for a year, starting on July 23, 2021, and ending on August 8.
If they fail to hold the games then, if the crown virus becomes still too much of a threat, the games will be cancelled.
No one wants to think that way to the end.
The Olympics are no ordinary sporting event.
Nothing is spared, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last games.
The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of the selection committee of the city presentations.
The grander the presentation —the more likely it is to receive the kiss.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympics, or more than $20 billion.
For the second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, 75 million dollars, about ten billion ISK, were put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already allocated ISK 30 billion to the project.
But that amount is only a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and, in general, to strengthen the infrastructure of the country to cope with such tournaments, prepare it and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been going on these days but has been delayed by a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by the Auditor General of Japan, published at the end of last year, stated that the cost was almost double that figure.
It is likely that the cost of postponing the games will not be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it could cost between $2 billion and $6 billion in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run in the range of $15 to $30 billion.
The figures are so high that all tax revenues from the Icelandic government only lasted for about half an Olympic Games, at the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often become the subject of discussion by economists, who try to scrutinize the numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.
At the very least, many people seem to have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, the number of jobs increases very much in the short term, but in the long term, cities tend to suffer from debt tailings and high operating costs for low-used structures.
Rio in Brazil is facing significant debt due to the 2016 games and has been having trouble costing maintenance on all the large sports facilities built before the games.
The figures for the 2012 London Olympics show that only 10 per cent of those who were employed at the Olympics in London were previously unemployed.
This means that we are not talking about new jobs, except in a small way.
In general, cities have not benefited financially from hosting the Olympics because of the staggering costs of the structures built for the games.
The benefits, however, are often thought to be due to increased traffic from tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the Games, although there is considerable uncertainty regarding the 2021 Games.
It is also not known if it will be possible to receive all the number of spectators who usually attend the games.
The main thing, however, is the credit that the cities must have been chosen, but it is difficult to assess in terms of money.
Because despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the players bring is not of such a nature that it can be put on a price tag.
But while the show is magnificent and nowhere to be spared, it’s of course not just about money.
There are the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some people, it’s just a surprise that they’re going to have to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian five-pointer and gold medalist in her article on the page of the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, is case-light and would have been far from fun this summer, but she hopes to be in competition form for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were planning to quit after the games this year, had they been held on time, the postponement of the games in some cases means they quit the competition before the games take place.
Rely on their body simply not to go through years of rigorous exercises.
Few athletes made as much impact in the hearts of the audience at the Rio 2016 Olympics as gymnast Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold necklaces and one bronze.
Biles has been interviewed in his home country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She is planning to play in 2021, but she is not sure that she will still be at the top of the games next year, as she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered high age, it is at a higher level for a leading female gymnast.
“It’s a sensitive issue,” Biles says, but smiles at another in an interview published on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page asking if she intends to reach the same level of success at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
“I don’t know if I’ll still be at the top after a whole year of practice,” Biles said.
She has previously mentioned that her body can’t tolerate the stress that comes with gymnastics training for much longer.
She is currently training for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop exercising when the pandemic was at its height and the gym was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles any more than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form certainly a little better than that of most people.
“We have a plan right now.
It was hard to start practicing again after the gym opened.
We started slowly but we are back to full swing and I will increase the exercises steadily as the year goes on.
Of course, we don’t know exactly how these games will be played or whether they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, can’t do otherwise.
"I've put too much effort into leaving the sport now," Biles said.
With it, like many others, there is doubt or perhaps rather awareness that the situation may arise that the games will not be held in 2021 either.
To think about it is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation in the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics given that they will be held in a year.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postponing a wedding due to the pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was due to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about right now,” she told People.
“We want to get married someday and have the wedding of our dreams, and have everyone present who is dear to us.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what is important right now and that is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I’m more interested in weddings these days.
There’s a lot going on and we need to focus on what’s going on in the world.”
