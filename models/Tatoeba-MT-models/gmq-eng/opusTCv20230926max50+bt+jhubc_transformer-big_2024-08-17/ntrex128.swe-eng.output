AM in Wales is worried about "appearing as a puck"
Some AMs, members of the Welsh National Assembly, are confused over a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes after plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
AM across the political spectrum is worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who do not speak Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means poop.
An AM for Plaid said the group was generally "unsatisfied" and has suggested other options.
A Conservative Welshman said his group is "open" to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W in Welsh is pronounced like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently compiling legislation for the name change, said: "The final decision for what members of the Assembly should be called is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members or WMP, but the MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
AM apparently suggests other options, but problems reaching a consensus could cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM gets to vote on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia holds referendum to change its name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its neighbour’s name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said he will ignore the result.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silenced when the churches of Harlem run into trouble
“Older people I talk to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before,” Mr. Adams said.
"Now there is neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
“People are living differently these days,” he said.
“Bars aren’t like the area’s living rooms anymore, where people go on a regular basis.”
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not go as far as the leaders expect and that "sooner or later they will end up on box one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with owner-occupied apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments probably will not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community of 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's congregation planned the renovation, they also built the chime.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson’s son and successor at St. Martin’s, proudly called the music game “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the chime in July had another name for it: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first glockenspiel played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the larger glockenspiel in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin’s are a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs – some hired by the Church’s laity, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The General Assembly – the congregation’s governing body made up of laymen – wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would “try to pass on the cost” to the General Assembly, despite the fact that the General Assembly had not been involved when the diocese hired architects and contractors.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Who Dives for Lobster in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who ducked for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone had been ripped open.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel told me.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is reported to be critical.
It is not clear what shark it was.
Lifeguard captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said the victim suffered trauma to his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn push into the UK beauty market, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty gaits will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of supermarkets’ attempts to fill the shelves that were once occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's said it plans to double its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offerings from L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees will also gain more space with marked areas, as in stores like Boots.
The retail chain is also relaunching its boutique make-up brand, so that most of the products are vegan – which is what more and more young customers are demanding.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing stalls in two Sainsbury’s stores – the first stall opened in Croydon in south London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying smaller amounts of food every day in local stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, has said their stores will look increasingly like department stores in an effort to fight off cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos booths in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat booths since buying both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempts to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated after a dispute over how revenue from Boots sales in supermarkets would be allocated.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business of 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We’ve given our beauty practices a new look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and with an appealing environment in convenient locations, we are now an enticing beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious that TV presenter Holly Willoughby is pulling out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand Truly, with casual clothing and accessories.
Their operations have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragons Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “outraged” at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favourite admitted that her new deal – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she could no longer focus on their Truly brand, with casual wear and accessories.
The operation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of their vacation homes.
A source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's number one priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that the This Morning presenter’s decision to pull out could cost the company millions due to significant investments in everything from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the risk of further delays to the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of chairman in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tough talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider “unworthy of a president” and for being so positive about North Korea’s leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a “news anchor voice”:
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States after North Korea's first disarmament steps.
He noted that the United States is instead continuing sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his supporters.
“North Korea is doing great,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results – an end to rocket tests, freed hostages and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake on Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had lost their homes, a state of emergency was not declared, which is required for international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they’ve been very clear that they’re not asking for international help, which complicates the whole thing,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children is gathering a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the Natural Disaster Agency spokesman, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
In the face of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still woefully unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning having been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even in perfect conditions, travelling between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate logistics even further.
A hospital ship that has lain anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for it to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia’s run-down infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and rails.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equalised at last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring an 89th-minute goal at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea’s goal when his team was 1-0 behind.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the far post.
The attempt flew high over the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over the hopes of Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get into a position to get the ball and players like Shaq are always playing forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think much about it, I just fired."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker poured a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spun off near midfield and sprinted to Liverpool’s side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at midfield.
Then he got a superb kick that brought Hazard into the goal area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far post with a left-footed kick past Liverpool’s Alisson Becker.
Liverpool are fighting against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face off against VIDeoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble by buildings that collapsed in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday, triggering waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was full of debris from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with a knife wound at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Superintendent Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment, but police said no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is being treated like a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She says "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the perimeter and another just outside.
A number of police assistants stood inside the barricade with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell latest victim of bickering over rewriting history
An excommunication would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolish" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be drawn into the ongoing debate over the removal of statues."
Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Wrong Cromwell might be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 19th century opinion of, and is part of, the historiography of a man who many believe should still be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, consider that Cromwell defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict of the mid-17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known figure who represents one side of the issue.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated.
Killing pig kills farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered in blood in a trail at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccine into pigs in a pigsty on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a pigsty nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and twisted,” the cousin who is identified with the surname Wu told the Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid further attacks while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and those responsible for the market are reported to be negotiating compensation for his death.
It’s rare for pigs to attack humans, but it’s happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig was pushing a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They’re just playful.
They nibble and they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
“You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa brought heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it travels over cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
But Rosa will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind speed of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five o'clock EST on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, mudflows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5–10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rains.
It is definitely not recommended that anyone ventures out into the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into rushing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching trough does bring some locally heavy rain to parts of Southern California’s coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to mud flows and slippery roads.
It was the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rain becomes more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October could mean intense temperature changes across the U.S., as the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost a ten degree difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start on October by around 30 degrees from the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be around five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high chance of warmer temperatures than the eastern U.S. average in the first half of October.
Over 20 Million Watched Brett Kavanaugh's Interview
Over 20 million watched Thursday’s arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued and normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday’s last-minute twist — Arizona Senator Jeff Flake’s deal with the FBI giving them a week to investigate the accusation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely sure Kavanaugh groped her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he’s absolutely sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers last Friday was higher than the 20.4 million stated by Nielsen.
They averaged the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks showing the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people watching from offices.
By comparison, there are as many viewers as for a football game in the playoffs or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had the most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second most viewers with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters shouting at him as he attempted to take an elevator to an interview with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down at the floor for several minutes as the protesters screamed at him, which was broadcast live by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would have more to say after questioning the committee.
The network aired live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to carry Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote by the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee in the coming week, as minority Democrats have urged.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision had a major impact, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political games' around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political games” about Britain’s future and undermining the nation’s interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely unreasonable.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in jail for murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and into the neck.
Police thank the Louisiana State Police’s escapee task force, the State Police Law Lab, the Southern University Police Department and residents of the area for assistance with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "effort and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20.
The six-foot-long (1.98 m) forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You worry about these things all the time," Wade said.
Volcano spewing ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned on Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and they recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several rumbles and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on windshields in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which stands 72 km southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with riot police while thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by riot police threw eggs and ink at them, leading to dark dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Fighting also broke out later in the day and police officers used their batons to stop them.
For several hours the independence groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists shouted "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local press.
The mood is still tense in the region, which is longing for independence a year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but participation was low as most of those opposed to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but had to take a different route.
Electrician Narcis Termes, 68, attended the separatist protest with his wife, saying he no longer believes Catalonia will become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal win in regional elections in December, Catalan pro-independence parties have found it difficult to keep up the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders are living in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial on their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on her mobile phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry man arrested after car drives into house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 to Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt’s side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s side still haven’t got a away win in the Premiership this season and will face Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna into the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning streak to six games – head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against sharp visitors
Holt’s team should have taken the lead long before they scored; their straightforwardness gave the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after sliding in to measure Craig Halkett's nod across the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could attack in certain games.
And that’s how the crucial goal was made.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to give Menga a chance, scoring goals from the middle of the goal area.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left alone.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was turned down by Rangers goalie Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston’s goal area and were handled without any problems. Two penalty claims – following Halkett’s challenge by replacement Glenn Middleton and one at hand – were dismissed.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the credit for galvanizing the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skilfully organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on edge right through.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn’t measure up – they only opened the home side once – and that’s something of an alarm clock for the Rangers, who are in the middle.
Erdogan gets a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered smiles and blue skies (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have clashed over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world’s largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard, denouncing both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dueling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and condemned as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east London, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped the car and a paramedic was called, but the man died on the spot.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they are trying to identify the man and notify his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been rerouted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Riot
Six prison guards have been injured in unrest at a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Office.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialized “tornado guards” have been called to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be assigned to the police and may face extended prison sentences.”
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (areas of drought may benefit)
It’s rare for tropical depressions to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy surges across the desert in the southwestern United States, at the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, bringing rain late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low-pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center’s latest models predict 5–10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is very serious, but some of the rain will probably be beneficial because the southwestern United States is suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-proof this Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 135 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travelling north at 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach the landmass of Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can receive heavy rainfall, which poses a considerable risk of flooding.
“A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm,” reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the desert in the southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and mudflows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to the phone to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered, the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s recklessness and outrageous tactics,” Trump told supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the meanness, the anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress about his indictment.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most adept legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-rate history of serving the public,” he told his supporters in the West Virginia audience.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running," he said.
“That’s why I’m going around fighting for great candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to “oppose and thwart.”
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, number rises
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed against the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six-meter-high waves crashed against the beach at dusk, sweeping out many to certain death, destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami came after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of immediately running away, and they fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster agency, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone, it was carrying cars, logs and houses. It hit everything in its path," Nugroho said. He also said that the tsunami had traveled on the open sea at up to 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
The aftershocks still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake last Friday was 200 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "comprehensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the victims and injuries could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area known as Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
“There are over 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for failing to inform it that the tsunami had struck Palu, but authorities said the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building screams frenzied warnings about the tsunami to people in the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes against the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off all communications around Palu, making rescue work more difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo flights with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city’s airport has been opened for relief work and will remain closed to other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from World Vision in Donggala have made their way to Palu where they seek shelter under tarpaulins in the yard outside the office, but they saw devastation along the way, according to Mr Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have begun the bitter relief effort, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may only be used if a state of emergency is declared following a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status has not been announced yet.”
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons still hoped that their loved ones would turn out to be the miracles that light up gloomy natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman trapped under rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandino, Indonesia’s national paragliding team coach, had trained two of the missing paragliders ahead of the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Monday, were his students.
“As a paragliding veteran, I have an emotional burden of my own,” he said.
Mr Gendon told us that hours after the paragliders heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants attending the beach festival.
But his messages only got a gray buck, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM replenishment at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an ATM machine at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM at the entertainment facility and was supposed to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the message.
While he was busy, another man "jumped up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the perpetrators should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, saying, “The creature formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, who canceled for "emotional reasons" according to the program's creators.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year as he talked about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, we are we.
It went from Kanye, meaning ‘the one’, to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are.
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Troops fired weapons at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans with monthly grants for students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double AI funding
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several sections of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, even though the U.S. does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to doubling the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A double budget could double the chance of the next big AI breakthrough being made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked U.S. Othello player, and later sat in the leadership of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google’s China division.
Lee mentioned earlier U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next step would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is taking the academic leaders away from us, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said new immigration policies could also help the U.S. with AI innovation.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides grants to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative it calls AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence hasn’t made any progress in months.
Macedonian referendum on renaming
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has hindered the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change would undermine the identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the minimum 50 percent turnout required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question on the ballot in the referendum is: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth changing the name if it allows Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, to join the EU and NATO.
“I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of parliament have said that they will follow the outcome for it to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority of the Parliament.
According to the state election commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I vote for my children, we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko are voting in the referendum in Macedonia on the country’s name change, which would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, staged a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by boycotters of the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneak in through the back door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would lead to much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
“I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said a "Yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43% of voters intended to vote in the referendum, falling below the minimum turnout required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of participants were planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said yes.
In order for the referendum to count, 50% of registered voters must be registered plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for Western-oriented government policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes it through entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton’s proposal in Manchester City’s 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass from midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and ventured into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He made his way around one defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's goal area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling on the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the goal area to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the opening edge in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's territory on that game.
He sent a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment it got out of range.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
The Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competitive Scherzer wants to pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who are ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still have a chance for the playoffs.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
“We’re playing for nothing, but we might get a chance to rub the rubber knowing the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I’d face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to be there?”
The Nationals have not announced their start for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they are leaning toward letting Scherzer pitch under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington’s right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump makes speech in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about how important it is that Republicans vote in the upcoming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not running, but I’m running. That’s why I’m going around fighting for sovereign candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see a horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their meanness, their horribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them have it."
Democrats, he said, are struggling to “resist and prevent.”
“You’ve seen that for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and horrible and fake.”
He mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met by loud booing from the onlookers.
"Do you remember what she said?
“Did you read the document?”
'Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, I'm expecting one...' That was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don’t tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – ironically similar to the issues that Jeremy criticised former leaders for.
The announcement of the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour’s local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of “friendlier, gentler” policies has been forgotten long ago, if it ever even began.
It has become increasingly obvious that dissenting views are not tolerated within the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged on the basis of whether its leaders accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously thought had a similar political outlook that I expected me to make a turnaround and take positions that I otherwise would never have agreed with – whether it was about national security or the EU’s internal market.
Every time I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – I follow a tirade of mischievous social media calling for my dismissal, criticising my politics and saying I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues as they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every single day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this era’s policies is the level of insults that are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality we are no longer this broad church, and with every censure and change in the rules of selection, the party becomes ever narrower.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so "it'll work out".
But that’s not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that literally caused my primary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at the local level and as government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused by my views on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those of you who promoted the motion on Friday, I just want to say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour’s leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – Labour members as well as others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat to depose me or political convenience will stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Comments on: Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Oslagna Ayr p<0xC3><0xA5> topp
Two last-minute attempts may have slightly distorted the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this delightfully entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match.
They are now on top, the only unbeaten side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be pleased.
“We’ve been tested during our games so far and are still unbeaten, so we’re so obviously happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Ayr deserve it, they took better chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was let in by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a 17–5 lead in the break.
However, Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It then became a long wait after a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the pitch, and after the restart, Ayr increased the lead again with an attempt from Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Ayr's action, Captain Blair MacPherson, was then given a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
However, the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-line out behind Ayr's maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent off flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star looks ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant business after it is discovered that he has been named CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays in with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series finale, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source at the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to venture into Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the court opens the way to the Pacific again
Sailors patrol a rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong – and so is the longing to sail the Pacific once again.
This hope is higher than in decades now as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the rulings of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them their own outlet to the sea.
Monday’s decision also has great significance for Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts find it incredible that the court is ruling in Bolivia’s favor, and that not much would change even if it did.
The UN court, based in the Netherlands, is not entitled to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia’s chances.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She claims that Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has eaten away at Chile’s remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not think that the Court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia “an unprecedented opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Requires Confidence in U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said the nation would not dismantle its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resolving the impasse over three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "wishful dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. protests against a statement to end the Korean War would ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first initiating significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to do away with an arsenal it probably sees as its only chance to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest line of huge headwear heading to stores near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a range of wacky, oversized headwear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the style icons of Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like wide hat brim that completely took over the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a magician’s hat and even a pineapple – but they aren’t meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had sewn together lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature resembled a wetsuit with a snorkel and a diving mask, and another looked like a melted cone of glass.
And if you continue the enormous courage, you are in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the huge caps may be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a brim of 60 cm that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another big creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The terracotta Raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills crucial for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain outstanding academic performance and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test scores, only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other community engagement.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement customized curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and in-demand topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received an A in the final exam Higher Grade.
Data, collected from SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject choice is now considered as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics on curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Commission for Employment and Skills found that, for various reasons, employers found it difficult to fill their vacancies, with 17% attributed to a lack of language skills.
That said, language skills are becoming all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With an increasing number of future jobs requiring language skills, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons published by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent said they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and with French being the only language that totaled a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the UK ahead of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he played has yet to be determined.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season play at this stage of my career to get ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled appearances over the next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Awaiting a confirmation vote by his nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress ahead of the upcoming November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 7 p.m., tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online below via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s questioning of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense after allegations of his sexual assault, with an expected delay of the Senate vote of up to a week while the FBI’s investigation into the case goes on.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their bones ahead of the November election.
President Trump said these five gatherings next week aim to “engage volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Controlling Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign period,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The night’s event, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may draw in fans from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh’s media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come there to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hopes alive ahead of Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided sessions, the pairings on Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever ahead of competitions like these.
So what is the momentum now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so we’re carrying that as a little momentum I guess,” Spieth said as he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in their sails, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and took home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example.
The winthroat rattled even higher as his round continued and he dropped a crucial putt to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had been behind by two after two games.
His putt who won them the game at 15 was met with a similar roar, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left now.
18 holes to win.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but adorable couple is four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the reactions of the crowd confirm that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could bring home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cut the process short with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on front nine lowered the Spaniard and Swede into a hole they never even got close to crawling out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and foursome are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead for the last day but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a fighting spirit that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup final day
Europe will have a strong advantage on the Ryder Cup’s last day after coming out from Saturday’s foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over a besieged Tiger Woods and took home a whopping four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, which struggled to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got going during the morning’s four-ball game with 3-1.
The United States offered more opposition in the foursome and won two games, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who made it through two games on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and foursome, and seven of those in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's four-ball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn’t have tailwind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit in singles matches, however Furyk's side only need a draw to retain the trophy.
After being second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday could be difficult to get through.
North Korea says it will "never" disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual general assembly that in the past year, North Korea had taken “significant steps to show its goodwill,” such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing installations, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no chance of us unilaterally disarming ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a phased approach to nuclear power that would reward North Korea as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution entirely as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work towards the “denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected negotiations to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘decommissioning first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion, even objecting to the ‘declaration to end the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can get us on our knees is a pipe dream for those people who lack knowledge about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that US leaders highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding, “If the party on this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a standstill.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different than last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s future ability to reach the U.S. mainland with rockets was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocketman” on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but it said that much work still remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying that "whether it takes two years, three years or five months", doesn't matter.
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the maintenance of the UN Security Council’s sanctions must continue with force and without fail until we bring about complete, definitive, verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands" a few hours later.
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and even a nuclear power complex if the US took “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him the “corresponding measures” he sought were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and moving toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Course on Getting Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has prompted all graduate students to improve their sleep habits in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeinated “durations.”
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often clueless about the very basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why don’t I get to know this until now, in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep – which surprised me.
The course, organized for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Health Services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive assignments.
Part of the course includes a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior right away.
But we think they have a right to know — just as you have a right to know about the health benefits of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in being “divine” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough, good-quality sleep should be the student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain into a state of starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has attended one of his courses last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar program of study before commencing their studies at the high-performing department.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn around the clock, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas goal lowers Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss today as Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's lopsided side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to take home their first win on the road since February’s 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team delivered Gerrard’s second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers never evened the score.
With the Rangers now falling to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more problems at lye for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-oiled game outshined his opponents every time.
The Rangers may have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass let Scott Pittman through to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back post.
The Rangers took control of the game, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their play during the game’s final third.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have had punishment when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's call.
Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily accepted Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livi’s opening shot in the 34th minute may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their kneeling deserved it.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's stalemate.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher matched Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outsider hit the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get his opponents to play exactly the kind of games they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up the long pass after the long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened their lead in the final stage, but McGregor managed well to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside after the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late penalty claim when he struggled with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's calendar: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger meter.
Geiger meters have become a cornerstone of science since then, and figure prominently in pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger gauge, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to 'see' cancer cells
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to 'see' cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and then be re-injected
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, watched her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well
Kanye West was booed out of the studio on Saturday Night Live after a tumultuous performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town in which he wore a Make America Great cap, he rallied against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it didn’t air, the play of West’s statement was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear if Rock tried to make fun of West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headdress.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I dropped low,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you also want to sink low?" and said that he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments attracted more burop at least twice from the audience and co-workers from SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person said, "There was dead silence in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with his performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West got support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up to the mob.”
But the talk show’s host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply “was himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his “art”) who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now “the creature formerly known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puffy Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Man convicted of attempted knife-cutting in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington battles toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken out negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen mean young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also her 31, admitted that he feels "quite strongly" about tackling the problem.
“I personally feel pretty strongly, right now — where have we gone wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He continued, "What is native and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be a certain way to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
Clearly, something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be doing any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is “ready with battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife thanks to the series, so in that way it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health officials say.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an urgent issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked GOP senator's data, shrouding "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned claims that one of her employees had posted personal information on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement.
The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual assault against the nominee for Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and released the information of a member of Waters’ staff, Hill reported.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the objector's motives.
They need to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to be trying to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to remove Waters in the middle of his term, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned “appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities” of these fraudulent demands.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - Powerless Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It’s now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new film with a British tilt, and the same seems to apply to this remake of the latest Johnny English action comedy – a series of spy parodies that kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and re-emerged in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sharp satire about how obviously bad we are become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face got his license to blunder to sake renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for cinema audiences even in non-English-speaking countries
He is, of course, the quirky secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour has gotten a little bit of Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that wreak havoc wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the latest JE movie
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy appears, but the humor feels rather low-key and strangely superfluous, especially since the “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it is adapted for children instead of adults and for me, Johnny English's weird antics are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film exploits in the role of Bean.
The ever-present issue now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all of Britain’s agents out in the field to the agent of the service’s great dissatisfaction – an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-hitting figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script offers little to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that when every single active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in person, now employed as a teacher in some affluent institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover on the side.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-lived sidekick Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey-sticks-role in which Vicki Pepperdine is near-wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain’s computer troubles: the hapless Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical antics: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they wreak havoc as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English unleashes sheer anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta’s house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but even though the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderate all in all.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drawing up a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby the British work a four-day week – but are paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to hand over savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend — but keep the same paycheck.
According to sources, the idea would “fit” with the party’s economic agenda in favor of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A senior Labor official told The Sunday Times: “A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen in a day, but a four-day work week is a pursuit that fits in with the Party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker as well as the overall industrial strategy of the Party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even The Greens, which promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this goal is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not party policy and it is not something the party agrees on.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless leaders” and “parasites” at state companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get their full stake back, as a Labour government can make “deductions” because of what they perceive have been wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10 percent of the private company’s equity is handed over to its employees, who then face annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s investigations could prompt any Republican senators to change their stance on the issue.
In an interview aired Sunday, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Certainly,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I went into the hearing, I’ve spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and said, "Have you done that?"
He was determined, convinced, unequivocal."
Graham’s voice, however, seems unwavering.
“I’ve already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite refueling,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vehemently,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she names couldn't verify it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a hugely impressive lineup of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 statement, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers would perform a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling, or in other meaningful ways help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel like they’re making a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that the collected assets have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and actors committed to “helping children develop to their full potential”, promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice such as malnutrition a footnote in history,” Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures had been taken that require the UK to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes dietary programmes targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on its website: “what makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?”
Responded Global citizen: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use its fleet in a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports, the interior minister said.
The government can “if necessary” resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it appears at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think they’re in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the sea lanes are kept open and, if necessary, apply a blockade, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group calling itself the “Voice of the Energy Consumer” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are indeed the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “dayfly” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was set back by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading trade association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I strongly disapprove of a third party disrupting our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a “real think” if she’s going to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would take a "proper look" at her participation in the U.S. presidential election following the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will be taking a serious look at running for president.”
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was “taking this country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own supporters did not believe she would run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through now that he’s back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers are returning with,” she told the crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the “elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans that “they come back as other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is any respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and airmen, and all the other members of the military, have given the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempting to obstruct a report on domestic violence and gun possession while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, as well as the District of Columbia support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a judicial review aimed at a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-the-court application Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons" beat her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce large numbers of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed a 2014 decision by immigration authorities that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a provision violates that principle,” the report said.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny immigrants’ entry harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “deliver necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious ones – that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked increasingly grim.
“It feels very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance picks up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is scarce.”
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rummaging through water-damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged in the 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershocks.
With tearful eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to escape.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US newspaper about the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the fact that China Daily paid a supplement to the Des Moines Register - the state's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the U.S.'s 6th congressional election, something that China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in U.S. elections highlighted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington intended to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with increased tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now doubling the bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“China’s government is using America’s cherished tradition of free speech and free press to spread the propaganda by publishing paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the differing views that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economy, as the media is ruled with an iron fist by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers turned down the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters ahead of midterm elections through Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
As many top Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who faces multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming election.
The sentiments surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
You can’t turn back the clock,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) last attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators chanted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate building as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to take a toll,” Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been loud, it’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among even indeterminate female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, despite not liking the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony alleging sexual assault against the nominee for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
“This has become a confused mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets through, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democratic campaigners, told the news channel.
But Americans in general seem to be divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and the latter seems to be who they believe most.
A recent YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents definitively or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those from at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh violently assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals to her while attending a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company should bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers to work on the project and a group of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren’t talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all business models are upended overnight.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era on the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded with Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England who was awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he had been awarded the British military's most prestigious award.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the line of fire and led with "great bravery" the line forward before alone settling the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humbled before."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honoured to play a role in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 and got to see Greta Gris instead
Imagine this, you’ve stayed up all night to see the Bellator 206 only to be refused to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose featured 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the show was suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours of the morning to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the change to a cartoon children's program as "a sick joke."
“It was the government’s decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes"
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their scheduling to better include British viewers in the future.
“I think we will be able to find a solution in terms of the replay,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won’t be able to resolve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
In fact, it was a state issue.
I can promise you that won’t happen next time.
We will be showing five games instead of six - as we normally do. We took ourselves in over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Felt 'Inferior' Due to Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to his peers while growing up because of his sexuality – but it also spurred him on to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize he wasn’t like everyone else until he was in high school.”
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-off appearance on Laverne's first show, Daley recounts how he felt "less worthy" than others growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: “This feeling of feeling less valued and feeling different has been a real source of the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “someone,” he said, so he didn’t betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for LGBT rights, taking advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said his crush on a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “came as a surprise.”
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” — he attended his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was hard to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “whole life perspective” had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning gold,” he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said Dad didn’t accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they got their tickets to the London 2012 Olympics – where he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him: you won’t be able to sit on the front row dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home crowd in an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - a song that had followed him to the Olympics and still gave him shivers.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but then he has to fix the form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day between acting cheerleader and practicing his game in the hopes of getting a chance to show off his skills.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the peak of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape for the tough course at Le Golf National, where the long ruff often punishes misses hard.
It’s not just the course that discourages, in the ninth match on Sunday Mickelson will face the champion Francesco Molinari, who, together with novice Tommy Fleetwood, won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points down ahead of the 12 singles matches, have a tailwind in the start, Mickelson’s match could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say much else.
"He totally understood the role he had today, patted me on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“There’s nothing wrong with his confidence.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams in previous seasons and in the past week.
I didn’t think he would be able to play two games.
I thought he could do more, but now it's as it is and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite lived up to the heights of his individual accomplishments.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He brings so much more than just games.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon be a mere memory
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but ultimately won by the smallest possible margin with the result 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“It reminds you that we led big at Valderrama, we led big at Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we narrowly won,” said Bjorn (on the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday and leading with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give it our all.
Go out and do everything right.
This isn't over until we see the score on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this cup and that is where our focus is.
I’ve been saying it all along, I’m focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we’re well aware of what’s waiting on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Björn was pleased with his players’ performance on a tough golf course and added: “I would never be able to do this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges await.
Tomorrow it will be the individual performances that apply, and that is a completely different matter.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there on your own, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he too has to go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bear, his opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major reversals in the last few days of a competition, both in the winning team at Brookline before ending up as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players for the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to go out as fast as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the tempo gets going in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these middle matches.
We made our lineup and placed the guys as we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight and faced Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter faced the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it goes all the way,” Bjorn said of his single picks.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The German Navy’s newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but it won’t be launched until at least next year due to faulty systems and high costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Palatinate", the lead ship for the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery were fatal for the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen frigates.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and naval missiles, as well as some stealth techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the ground-breaking warships – which allow Germany to project power abroad – are already obsolete when they are put into service, Die Zeit writes.
The fateful F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware errors" that rendered the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
Weaknesses in the software were particularly important as ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has a significant overweight, which leads to impaired performance and limits the Navy's ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Aside from faulty hardware, the entire project’s price tag – including crew training – also becomes an issue.
It is said to have amounted to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – compared to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion at the start-up stage.
Problems affecting the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy is actually "beginning to lack fully equipped ships".
The official said it is a growing problem, as old ships are being decommissioned but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust eavesdrops on the secret lives of bats
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow southern and dwarf pipit trees as well as brown loaned and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area map of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can airplanes and some chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from house cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, examine nests, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species of bat.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a good area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a variety of favorable habitats.
But there’s a lot about bats that’s still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape conviction while his lawyers threaten to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him “fake news” and said people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forwards have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a Live video on Instagram, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “fake news” when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claims were reported.
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today was fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good," the player said, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations, which they have called “an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral injury to an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent” a “good guy” let down by the “last percent.”
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple were having sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because she felt “afraid of retaliation” and was worried about “being humiliated in public”.
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to overturn the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturer
Britain “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily cease production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no deal being concluded could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see production stoppages in our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern what car manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could lead to disruptions at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day’s worth of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and hence production would be forced to be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not only success for the moment to be appreciated now, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The statements made by not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite union at the factory, said his members are increasingly worried: “My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
A government official said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “shot for another week” as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump and Russia, and the president’s potential impediment to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardising Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing wiretapping equipment to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, and reports that he was about to resign emerged.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer” not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date for that has not been set, it could happen this week, or a postponement of a week given all the other things going on at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press updated.”
Some reporters would dispute that claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to any disapproval of TV reporters who “play for the gallery,” although she said, “I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery.”
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more question sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We’ve been looking at these numbers.”
Conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president perhaps showed why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of the assembled reporters.
Health minister writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland in regard to concerns about Brexit
The health minister has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of decommissioned status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, ahead of decisions expected in the autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That’s why I want to reiterate how much I value each employee’s effort, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennesseans Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He got to the sideline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher was brought out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/scope of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, giving him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, according to the Tory party’s new plans
The measure will neutralise Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless, as will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with more affordable housing promises and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in the stamp duty will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and homes purchased for rent, which may be up to three percent.
The Treasury Department believes the measure will bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by people living outside the UK, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The move comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to renounce quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “deplorable housing situation.”
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a startling range of proposals for housing reforms, including rent caps and an end to eviction without the tenant’s fault.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunities to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would devote my time as Prime Minister to re-establishing the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy housing as it is for hard-working residents of our country.
For too many people, the dream of owning their home has become just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to coach Scotland’
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to one day become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is looking forward to the challenge of reinvigorating the club from the North East of England, who are currently third in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played one game in the B-team and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But when I was growing up, I watched a lot of Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and that has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club."
Ross's representatives as coach of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding such an established name in such a big club. He has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now I judge success by the answer to the question 'can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
“This club absolutely belongs in the Premier League, given its structure and talent,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as a member of the Hearts coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa to come back from relegation to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close to relegation to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more at ease now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a crossroads,” he recalls, referring to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was just right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had okay results and could live decently on it. In addition, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There is a lot to get through each week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but to practice feels just right.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it. I feel better than I've ever felt in my entire adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to have a beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday
This summer’s heatwave has meant increased revenues for the country’s struggling pubs, but restaurant chains have been put under greater pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Still beautiful weather and the fact that England stayed in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolute best results with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubs offering food also had a hard time in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to have just wanted to go out and drink something.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales down by 3%.
RSM’s Paul Newman said: “These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the mass caterers market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups are still experiencing difficulties, although a 4.8% reduction in sales each year is particularly difficult to manage in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come more untimely for companies driven by food sales. Time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give any much needed respite."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyses data on the performance of 47 active groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children, sometimes as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school and college students shows an increase in fake Instagram pages
The result has increased the concern that it is sexual content that is posted there
20% of students stated that they had a “main account” that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school and college students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Instagram accounts,” a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The result has added to the concern that it is sexual content posted there.
20% of students stated that they have a clean “main account” that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter's secret page found a teenager urging others to "rape me."
According to the study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are lured into creating places on the internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of directors of the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an external member of the Board of Directors at the Governing Body’s Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as a unique opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her broad experience at the international level over the past decade.
“Eilidh has won great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are confident that the athletes of Scotland would greatly benefit from her becoming a member of the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic golds and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover, and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’ve recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I’m doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!”
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers to cows shares internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused controversy on the internet with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial with a humorous touch to show what freedom the new pump gives mothers who pump breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a hay-filled barn with cows to a song with lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but have no tail" and "If you didn't know, this is no udder, but tits."
The chorus continues: “Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies.”
But the commercial, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met with mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them just a few days after birth.”

Another comments: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But sure, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?”
Still another adds: "What a reality-avoidance commercial. "
Others defend the film, and one woman admits that she thinks the song is “hysterically funny.”
"I think this is brilliant.
I would have gotten one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another comments: "This is a funny commercial that targets moms who pump (often at the workplace or on the toilet) and feel like 'kisses'."
This is not a film that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump tucked into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and can be worn discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and its challenges, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and easily recognisable way the incredible feeling of freedom the new pump gives.
This isn’t the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk wearing clothes by designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp near the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has skyrocketed even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged. This is partly because the hateful rhetoric and harsh policies put in place by the Trump government have made it harder to place the children with reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons have themselves been undocumented immigrants, and afraid to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would be required to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be the reference persons for unaccompanied minors.
The authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not previously known to law enforcement authorities.
"Nearly 80% of people who are either themselves reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegally present in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," Albence said.
In order to handle children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, as was previously the practice, according to staff in the detention centres.
Many of them are present on video link rather than in person to plead their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for protection are quickly deported.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to staff at the detention centres and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say the concern is rising at larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs that a child is having a hard time are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that moving children to the tent city without having enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the traumas many are already grappling with.
Syria demands that US, French and Turkish “occupational forces” withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said the government in Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories” both from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the circumstances are good for them to return home, accusing "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that make refugees stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They are politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem stressed, however, that the deal had “clear deadlines,” and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the group's work would be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency is terminated prematurely by impeachment and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely hoping for.
In what would no doubt be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!”
At this point, there is no sign that viewers are tired.
Since 2014, prime-time viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and is almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the cable channel charts with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell is a longtime comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Nell Scovell tells me.
In the chaos there is entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, reporting from Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs Wade abortion case, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the well-being of the global economy.
Shutting down is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you’ve suddenly sat and watched for six hours on an expert panel debating Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background sources” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather bomber jacket (“a garment filled with hubris,” as the Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniels’ husbandry description of Trump.
I will never look at Super Mario again.
“Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he comes up with something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the Trump sequel’s rotating cast and daily machinations (muck fights with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single episode, you are left behind.
When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai, Hawaii, but he was owling indoors watching MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He couldn’t tear himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs in the past and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the smoothest race ever for the midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district receives a lot of money. It is thanks to a restructuring of a congressional district that two members are now competing for the same seat.
This newly redrawn suburban district in Pittsburg is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb is campaigning against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional changed in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign finance battle between the major parties’ finance sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a wide-spread special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats some head start.
The U.S. was considering punishing El Salvador for China support, but then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners evicted the Trump organization’s leadership team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to recall the heads of U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of "a recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," U.S. Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017. The money would, among other things, go to drug control and development and constitute financial aid.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively putting an end to consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will take place in mid-October. It is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, the diplomats said.
And the three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations against promises of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke anonymously.
Studying history
The next inevitable step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Donald Trump’s alleged abuses in court, which now has tangible evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to be directing his investigation into whether Donald Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If Congress were to change its majority, Trump would be held accountable to that assembly just as he prepares to run again in the election, and perhaps ultimately to a citizen’s jury.
There are many uncertainties in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how protracted the struggle can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the relentless march of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what is going to happen to Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year to secretly record the president, speculating that he would not be fit for office.
Rosenstein says The Times report is not true.
“How are we going to respond if the just-requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to serve on the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we in the midterm elections vote for a Congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I do not think we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table decorated with swastikas.
With that as a legacy, how could I be anything but an optimist about the future?”

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic ahead of meeting with Rapid Wien
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that their win against the Austrians after the impressive Spain game against Villarreal, which ended in a draw earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season, leading up to the 2-2 game against Villarreal. But he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard towards greater success.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game thinking we could get anything, and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have got it in at the end, but on the whole, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came again in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another important day in Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game. They got a good result at their last game, but if we have the audience with us, we can certainly advance and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The squad is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and do well."
Women Sleep Poorly Due to Fear of Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they want to be cared for, few people talked to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the plunge and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t tell them how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a big impact on costs.
Get the help of your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choices of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover the costs, or a self-insurance plan with your own funds, if you can afford it.
Establishing legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the start.
Establish a health care authorization, so that you can appoint a trusted person to review your medical care and ensure that the health care professionals follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and ensure that your bills are paid if you yourself are unable.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications are they?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready.”
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place at about 2:30 a.m., as a "one-off incident."
The victim did not see his attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to contact them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. Officials say the death toll is expected to rise.
Communications have been cut off, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to get any information from the Donggala administrative district, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a administrative district that stretches along more than 300 km of the northwestern coast of Sulawesi.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, in 2017 had a population estimated at 299,200 people.
The pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province are fisheries and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to Indonesia's disaster management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Also in 1996, western Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circumpacific seismic ring, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya district of Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for interfering with a domestic violence complaint and for opposing the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su detention and is being held on $500 bail to be paid if the suspect violates bail conditions, according to KTUU television.
He appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "guaranteed not guilty" when asked to state his stance, according to the network.
Palin is suspected of three minor Class A crimes, which means he could face up to a year in prison and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a class B crime, punishable by one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of meddling in the reporting of domestic violence and of possession of weapons under the influence in connection with that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, stemming from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck from construction and interior design chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He mowed down pedestrians and cyclists in his path at the attack, which took place in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the letter of intent on the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could amount to a death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was indicted by a federal jury on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder to support protectionist activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "comprehensive planning and intent," prosecutors said, while describing the way Saipov carried it out as "abominable, cruel and inhumane."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York City’s Southern District has not been charged in a death penalty case for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of embezzlement into espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is a Uzbek citizen, showed, according to court documents, a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he got inspiration for the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to put up the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges in the indictment.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of agreeing to life imprisonment without parole if the defendant pleads guilty only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s team of defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to press for the death penalty.
Tories MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he would lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that Britain “would have already gone out of business” if Nigel Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge that Theresa May faces in getting the deeply divided supporters to reconcile has been exacerbated by EU-positive Tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers deal, alive under attack from Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted she should push and try to get a deal with Brussels despite the setback, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package deal and “chaos”.
Bone said at a rally organised by the Leave Means Leave organisation in Solihull that he wanted to "spoil the Chequers deal".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been at the helm, we would have been out by now,” he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the district of Wellingborough in parliament, added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to renege on the Chequers deal.”
He made clear his opposition to the EU, saying: "We have not fought world war to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the claims that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British would have changed their minds and now want to stay is completely untrue.”
Tory party Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, speaking to the journalists. “I just want to say: ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.’
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with the party and with our election workers who are out on the streets making sure we get elected.
Put away the Chequers deal and start listening.”
And she added a stark message addressed to Theresa May: “Prime Ministers get to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said in the meeting that politicians must be allowed to "feel the heat" if they were to betray the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about the trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them, ‘We are not going to let you get away with it.'”
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilising the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the centre of the city.
A group of activists waved banners with the words “Tory members against Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
“These are the people who are saying they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for the Canada plus plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a pure farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning a "real thinker" about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to have a "real think about running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican state Representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Donald Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the subject of speculation that she may be taking on Donald Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th town hall meeting with voters since Donald Trump took office.
One person asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government. That means a woman at the top."
A man has been arrested for the shooting of LSU basketball player Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. for ET.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen in the photos.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus on Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died from it,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via news site 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had been on the scene and had held a gun, and he confessed that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after team order gave him win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ team order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position during the first two laps, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the depot first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the bunch, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went into depot one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after some wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free at the risk of bidding in place after a double-drag to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
In the end, he reached the 44th lap but did not manage to raise the pace during the remaining eight laps when Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It’s a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a first and a second," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president, speaking at a rally in West Virginia, did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "wicked, nasty and lying."
“The only thing that could happen and the nice things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying,” he said.
“You see press releases and leaks and they say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it.'
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
"No, we haven't leaked anything," he added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I have not covered up Ford’s allegations, I have not leaked her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her denial does not seem to have suited the president, who during Saturday night's meeting commented on it like this: "I'll tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continues to support the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sex crimes by three women, and he hinted that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see their meanness and their ugliness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Belfast Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars served Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Belfast Giants were given an early two-goal lead by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised for the home team before Dwyer re-established the Belfast Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave the assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who equalized at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Belfast Giants were in the lead at the first break when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard scored once more with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.
The Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died so that hundreds of people on a plane could escape an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he made sure a plane with hundreds of people aboard could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed behind to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian television channel ABC News.
“We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are devastated to hear this,” he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to over a thousand people.The country’s disaster relief authority says there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise as there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six meters high waves have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will be met with there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes on Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says a man is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now reports that one man is missing. Earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the sequence of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane slid past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying in very low.
"It's extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue effort by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank in the 100-foot-deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in either.
Analysts draw up a timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday concluded its plea in the second trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the information showed that his cell phone was with Chambers cell phone during the time period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, so went the police to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis some time after Chambers' death deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol finds that hip hop has come a long way from its origins in political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?!
A New York City nanny sues a couple for termination after a "racist" text message
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a misdirected text message from her mother, who complained that she was "a black again."
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was horrified to learn that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE NOT A BLACK AGAIN,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "disheartened" and fired Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino woman instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day’s work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal. She is claiming compensation in the order of $350 a day for the job she was initially hired to do, which would last for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she told the New York Post on Friday. "I know that's discrimination."
The couple repudiated the allegation that they were racists, saying that the only way out was to terminate Giselle Maurice's employment and that they were worried that they would not be able to trust her when they had insulted her.
“My wife had sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We’re not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
But would you entrust your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously. "
Plasco compared the lawsuit to “extortion,” saying his wife would give birth two months later and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack such a person?
It’s not very nice done,” added Plasco, an investment banker.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn’t think readers would be able to relate to a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s adoption, commented on the letter: “It’s hard to imagine what it was like for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun, given what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She told that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family”, adding that her father was proud in silence of his final success.
"He was quite quiet, and not a boastful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds at something. You become proud of the child even if it is not you who has achieved it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give Paddington credit himself."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that she was not expected to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to die in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicines that doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was extinguished.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this was happening.
I could not howl or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to pull myself together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the severe ordeal she was going through.
“No one knew about it,” she said.
"I bowed my head, and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving Women Set Up Postcards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and took his own life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells us that her son was a promising chef who had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile brightened the room.”
But he stopped working before he died, because he was “in a very dark place.”
Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling after he killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I worry all the time about the repercussions."
Sharon Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit still, talk about it.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
“He hadn’t said he was feeling depressed or depressed or anything,” she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says that his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to get through it. "It tears up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all need to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could accomplish something similar to what he asked for – an investigation that is limited in time and scope – then maybe we could get some agreement,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday. He added that he feared the committee would “split” because of deep-rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the time.
The midterm elections are due to take place in just five weeks, on November 6. If the Republicans make a bad choice, as is expected, they will be greatly weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "sinks" under Kim
The number of North Koreans defecting to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker says.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s reunification ministry, says 1,127 people defected last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher tariffs on human traffickers, were key reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
The North-South relationship, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free of nuclear weapons.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, on Saturday blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of success since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we certainly cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied allegations that he sexually molested Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally moved, and every once in a while he almost screamed and his voice stopped when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying the charges against him were a “grotesque and coordinated character assassination” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he is biased to the Democrats' detriment.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he were elected, and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but he’s unfit to work in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade abortion case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," Pelosi said.
Women have to endure.
It’s a righteous criticism, months and years of anger boiling over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual. Do you think?"
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And so she continued.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to vent anger partly because they are often misunderstood fundamentally.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried with indescribable anger, was being grabbed by an older woman by the collar. It was a chilly boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy that they managed to push you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt there was no reason not to investigate the idea of running for president himself.
“It was not a well thought out decision,” she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because she was late, she was behind with the money, and promised not to go in as a candidate unless she got together 2 million dollars.
It was a project doomed to failure.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, that her voice choked.
“You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schröder recalls, referring to the reactions of the press.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, ‘What are they going to write on my tombstone?’
"She was crying?"
Why the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening tension of the trade war between the US and China was deafening. The war is far from over, but the split between the countries could benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, which effectively means that half of all goods entering the United States from China are subject to tariffs.
Beijing has responded each time with the same coin, recently throwing tariffs of between five and ten per cent on US $60 billion worth of goods.
China has promised to match US measures, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to de-escalate in the foreseeable future.
Getting Washington to back down means bowing to demands, but publicly crawling for the US would be far too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the two economies' mutual dependence on each other.
“A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it’s actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously wanted to admit,” said Abigail Grace, a research assistant with a focus on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for returning refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept voluntary returnees and appeals for help to rebuild the country, which lies in ruins after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, in order to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team achieved the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, ended up in the water on the 16th hole par 3 course, losing to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players ever to score 5-0-0 since the tournament’s current format was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 & 4 by the European team's lowest ranked player, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world’s top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2&1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," Garcia said after the European team's victory.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the single on Sunday.
"What an incredible pride, beating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a 13-21-3 record for his career in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the world's best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA Tour of the United States and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be a captain.
You have to bow and bow.
They played better than us.”
Algal blooms: Decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decrease in concentrations of algal blooms for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, more uneven blooms are reported in the areas around the larger municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate reduced levels.
The algal bloom extends along more than 200 kilometers of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about a mile out to sea outside Hillsborough, but in fewer places than last week.
Algal blooms have also been observed in the larger municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported over the past week: off the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations on or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida last week.
