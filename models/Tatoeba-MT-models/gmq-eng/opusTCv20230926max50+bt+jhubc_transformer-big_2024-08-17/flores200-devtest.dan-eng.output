The antibody mixture ZMapp initially seemed promising in the field, but formal studies indicated it was less effective than presumed in preventing deaths.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that the researchers used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee’s letter, and accepts the Olympic family’s absolute need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC’s statement that it is in the best interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, to move forward with meaningful changes within our organization rather than de-certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent study that could shed light on how such a large-scale abuse, described so bravely by the survivors of Larry Nassar, could have gone undetected for so long, and backs up all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal — to make the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowered environment.
In the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor, and subsequently for the government under Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown at the top with a bright or carrot-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a feather shaft, but have other characteristics from feathers — rays and bee rays — the researchers inferred that feather shafts were likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
Removed structure suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for decoration. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chicken.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows the plumage of an adult individual and not the down of a chicken.
A car bomb detonated at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

Police said they suspected an alleged supporter of Daesh (ISIS) to be responsible for the attack.
They found that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma current.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic turns.

The Iraqi Study Group presented the report at noon today (GMT).
It warns that no one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this time will stop sectarian warfare, growing violence or a move toward chaos.
The report starts by calling for an open debate and for agreement to be reached in the United States on its policy towards the Middle East.
The report is very critical of almost all aspects of the government's current policy towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of strategy.
As the first of 78 recommendations, a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interference and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbours.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be the result of tidal forces between the galaxy’s dark matter and the Milky Way’s dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.
Television reports indicate that white smoke is coming from the power plant.
Residents near the facility were warned by local authorities to stay indoors, to turn off air conditioning and to avoid drinking tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrisome and that there was cause for alarm because of its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health workers.
In a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole tuberculosis-affected group still seems low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

Several million vials of encephalitis vaccines have also been promised by the government, which will help the health care system prepare for next year.
Plans for the delivery of vaccines to the historically hardest-hit areas this year were delayed due to lack of funds and low priority given to other diseases.

Infrared images show that the temperature fluctuations from night and day show that they are probably caves.
During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
"Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona said, "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the ground, although they do not behave as stably as large holes on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature throughout the day."
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter’s identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is codified very precisely in French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent so that voters and observers can see that the boxes do not contain ballots at the start of the vote and that no other ballots are added than those that are correctly counted and come from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision and according to specific procedures.

Her first was slalom, where she did not finish her first race. 36 of the 116 participants got the same result in the race.
In her second race, which was the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group with a total running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place woman, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four skiers in the women's seated group did not finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not rank in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have found her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with murdering his son.
She is in custody and awaiting trial, but evidence from eyewitnesses may be flawed because her photo has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and the courts have considered the publication of images to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists should be careful if they publish pictures of suspects and the like."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment is made.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders from before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other subjects covered include the future condition of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley for ten years, once an agreement has been signed, while the palistinian authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial had to be followed closely by the park rangers as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Nature Conservation and Cultural Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
A new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the resignation of the former CEP was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
Martelly’s response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October was the Commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 notified cases, defective iPods have been overheated, causing a total of six fires and giving four people minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents involving the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 cases of overheating, which the company called “non-serious.”
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Department announced that no injuries had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippines' capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed as dead so far.
Six hostages including children and the elderly were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took an elderly lady's place when she went to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He graduated as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the development of the baby’s lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also hailed Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died at night with two moons. Quite unique, just like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place now."
Out of 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia’s last monarch.
In the different extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there have been doubts about his condition.
He could not take the medication needed to combat his pain, as these are prohibited during the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using various hardware and software, and Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how Earth formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as "political sly talk and foolishness".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel a year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technology based on radars on the ground, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is put in and the above-ground trains will not stop in Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on the ground.
The fear of a lack of transport raised the possibility that you would be forced to play the match behind closed doors without the team’s fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Gal<0xC3><0xA1>pagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process should have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin fin geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus fin geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be machined into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin cable, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and put on other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books, which were called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color, depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together and then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system in almost every house,
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you’re using a satellite.
The satellite in the room receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster transportation methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are several medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Flocks of lions react very much like wolves or dogs in packs, animals which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (though not well), swim, jump far and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a phrase of snarling, shouting words.
Ozelottes prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (swap) via smells, by sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move around very quietly. Ozelotter hunts their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounces on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (as if they were moving across a mountain range or river, or if they were moving to a new island so that they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different features or adaptations in order to be a stronger competitor than it had previously been necessary.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a torn tongue; its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that got into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex wouldn't be able to do anything against it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a sleeper.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large feasts together where they lay on their sides while they ate.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, so-called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes were already living in the area at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true; although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the reverse of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment document (it measures 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches x 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the annotation was merely attached as an addition.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French government of Vichy - there are French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people living together and cooperating, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; and it also somehow defines the size of the community.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural influence, as well as fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as the only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, they relied on the state authorities, which were often not cooperative in enforcing all actions.
Nor did it have the right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating hockey and F1 motorsports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "island group".
Taiwan’s history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island named it Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which started a change of the original grain production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been re-established, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, which can be confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (such as the APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time keeps a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, a closer look was given at the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European countries together in spite of different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power influenced everyone from king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was properly lived up to.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching its destination. This blockade was in violation of the recognised international laws codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to these tactics, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitudes of most citizens and nations leaned toward pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems, and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were shown in a unique way; each Chinese time period or each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods there was fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit in the highest seat of the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, the ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in relationships beyond worldly life. He used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you’re inside the cave, it’s a total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-arc" mark resembles a V and the "down-arc" mark resembles a staple, or square, missing its lower side.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Strokes usually produce a softer sound, while Strokes sound stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed arc markings are determined by musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Mrs Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a crowd of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming group of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a mafia member showed the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for the bulk of the expenses, and bond yields ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of government.
Of course, the super profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one needs to understand the context in which the Order was founded.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that took place in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is related to scientific laws, as well as the way they translate into technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "influence" on societies that are hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, one can say that the motorized car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many people own cars, there are also more accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health to heal bodily injuries.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures arose that were related to geography, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris today is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known to be an epicenter of luxury since around 400 AD and lasted until around 1,100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was largely inspired by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, the Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes with.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried out to produce sufficient food to simply meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic due to age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as being distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People belonging to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unhappy cases where children through failure, accident, or intentional neglect have not been socialized by adults in their infancy.
Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some wild children have been deprived of their liberty by humans (most often their own parents); in some cases, this child neglect was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others claim to be raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost similar to the animal that has cared for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn new things – for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software, and aims to question, ask for, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without nutrition, care and education, but they do.
We see the system for foster families as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster family is tasked with providing all necessities that were not present in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction approach.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivators by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to a brain injury are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities for the interpretation of human behavior, can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two distinct pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection."
Separation and recombination mixes the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of man to satisfy his need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: impaired growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless prepared.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, it also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it shouldn’t surprise us if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disorder is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the clock while you sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is quite the opposite of the amount of tension a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute calm and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the love path Mahayana and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various divinities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the difference in the countries' system, process and culture led to the countries opposing each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies now became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost overnight obsolete when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for freight transport is the most efficient way of transporting large amounts of both people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's task has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and your goods, while at the same time affecting your enemy's ability to move his people and his goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain like the rest of Europe.
As far as we know, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them so they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that roamed hills or other pastures, often supervised by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more commonly known shepherds.
As early as the 16th century, carriageways were built in England.
Although the lanes consisted of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day.
Sleepers were invented quite early, to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were used, which were made entirely of metal.
The first known method of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors Australopithecus did not usually walk upright.
There are bipedal specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms. But if we don’t just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a great deal because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and man's extravagant lifestyle.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Congress President John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 in Independence Hall's courtyard.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, and on 9 July he had it read to his soldiers in New York; on 10 August a copy reached London.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving edition of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Most people don’t see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with dandruff and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medication container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific instructions on first aid for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in their host’s house or nest.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child that they have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take them over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific studies.
However, it does not stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to remove one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they marked either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape as well as plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, as well as studies of ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Where in the morning people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose workplaces are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has detached the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems; almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because motorists’ behaviour cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, motorists typically behave reasonably consistent; thus, traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) current, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road construction.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily dodge enemies and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater variety of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the dragonfly and the mayfly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Opinions differed about his theory – some thought he was right, while many thought the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That makes sense, because we can't feel the earth turning, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on earth, containing over 8 times as much water as the second-largest river on earth.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and is in some places up to six miles (about 9.6 km) wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet’s rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.
Although pyramid building with stones continued until the end of the old kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in the size and technical expertise of their constructions.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basic mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period that ends this sentence.
This is why the pencil was a good friend to most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is being used less since new writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages through computer screens and never have to get near a pencil sharpener.
You can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill, when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break down under little or no impact.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar gardens on the front, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on figuring out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they become more mature and reach adulthood.
Theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to perform certain actions, and what elements in their environment cause them to perform or not to perform certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow’s Pyramid of Needs and Hertzberg’s Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when a manager starts to lead his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of leader has a hard time making unpopular decisions, making disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team’s successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams expect the same level of expertise as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each of the members reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge when all available resources are applied effectively across an organization’s functional departments.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that fosters innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes like we have never seen before.
This gives us lots of information and materials to build simulation models with, which can help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes being able to manufacture machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, scheduling and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military industries, as it has been incorporated into several home computers and computer game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a good method to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is rebuilt, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience in general corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog’s author begins to strive to improve in writing to avoid criticism.
Additionally, “blogging forces students to become wiser about the world around them.” The demand to give the audience what they want inspires students to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active response to Internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written, as well as describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming, bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and other areas’ untapped natural beauty.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered genuine Canadian by outsiders.
Further north, there are large areas that are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape route between Europe and India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It makes sense to wear what might look like a wedding ring (it just shouldn’t look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don’t be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, that’s not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a variety of trinkets, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located very close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets in particular in the city center.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated in order to understand the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Along with the city's relative inaccessibility, it has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, remote regions.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country’s cities because it has a more Arabic flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entry fees to the park.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, as this gives either access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and is the place that many tourists regard as the primary focus area.
The Hong Kong skyline is a group of buildings that by their reflection in the water of Victoria Harbour are often compared to a glittering bar chart,
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong’s urban development is tightly packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you’re looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km from the coast and into Bangladesh and India's hinterland.
Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps —they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/moss areas.
The Sundarbans has been a game reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal royal tigers and about 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the cross-regional bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day although most, especially those going to the east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Deletaxas are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical ground clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011. It first opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most important group of indigenous people who lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA>s and Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>s, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of India", came into the world in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with the indigenous populations.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a lot of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world’s best polo teams as well as some of the world’s best players.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo courts of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
Also smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets, check out Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), the value of which is fixed at the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be able to be used, although British and US currency may be able to be used; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what it says on the thermometer.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals may well attack.
Every year a lot of visitors are hurt because they do not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells and keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruise ship were sunk; nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the city, which resulted in the assassination of Supreme Commander Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are found at Waitemata harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most common local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It’s perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but it’s easy to find bottled water if you’re worried.
For Australians, the idea of a “flat white” coffee is foreign. A “short black” is called “espresso”, the cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many people visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get injured on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to the advice of the authorities, read and follow the advice on signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea wasps occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can also occasionally be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and want to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active life in the ocean, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have offers for certain hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be made to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of participants at music festivals choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where the action is, you need to get in early to get a tent pitch close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music until late into the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those closest to it.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions), which is nice to know as cruises to Saint Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to ensure that guests spend as much time and as much money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually not present and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered at the expense of the house, but drunkenness weakens the judgment, and all real gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who has to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads there is low friction and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, in a very short time, enough snow can fall to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle glazing.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is mostly undisturbed all year round.
Safaris are the highlight for many and are perhaps the thing that draws most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land travel to see the great African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach the cars, and standard equipment is therefore enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can better see them with binoculars.
A hiking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walk-safari" or "safari on foot") consists of hikes that either take a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and your accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, with typical tickets costing around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Many hotels have an iron and ironing board, which you can borrow even if there is not one in the room.
If you do not have the option of using an iron, or if you do not like to wear socks that have been ironed, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burns).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it will take several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency and if you are concerned you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they do not know from home.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritations or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill humans, are not usually perceived as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase items in certain locations that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers heading to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
Be alert if you are not used to driving on the road: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp bends are plenty.
The speed limits set are noticeably lower than on pre- and post-road sections — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is even more important than usual to adhere to them precisely.
Oddly enough, the coverage on mobile phones is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied just like in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastry with fruit is common: apples are baked into cakes all year round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand
If you fancy some small, but full-bodied, cakes, you can try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either “dry” or “wet” depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is common to use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an overarching term that covers a wide variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further elaboration, it typically refers to the food originally sourced from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now the Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a number of single spicy dishes, the most popular spices being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety issues due to the possibility of a rider’s feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse, but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, some safety measures can be taken.
First, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, tight sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety braces, which cause the stirrup straps to be released from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, features a series of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain tops present breathtaking views from the tops for all visitors. Mountaineers from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes among its endless potentials for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve riding down snowy terrains with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski bums" who plan the entire holiday around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5,000 BC show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing or skiing.
It is related to, but usually does not involve alpine-style skiing or mountaineering. The latter is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You should see the ski route as if it were a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than if you walk – but it is only very rare that you get the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport checks several times.
In this context, however, the Schengen area functions more or less as a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be smaller in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi, and the culture surrounding it is also important for many S<0xC3><0xA1>mi with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all S<0xC3><0xA1>mi kept reindeer on a large scale, but they lived from fishing, hunting and the like and used mainly the reindeer as draught animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in S<0xC3><0xA1>pmi, the Sami area.
Although the word "gypsy" is often used especially among non-romans, it is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel instructions arise in the country you are visiting, your travel or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be designed for their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often general and simplistic when compared with the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage or serious disruption to society or cause loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, storm surges, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, drifting, ice caps and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their area, as this could affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Course in hostile environment" is likely to give the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here with much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but there are not many publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they bring valid documents with them for their return journey.
Governments’ willingness to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports of unspecified gender (X), or documents updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies just as much.
Visits at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the period since 11 September 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not had operations should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves returning and breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar, is called a countercurrent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to deep water can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue by trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, it’s no harder than usual to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you won’t get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been spotted, you might be able to wait for you to be rescued.
Homecoming shock comes faster than culture shock (there isn’t as much of a period of excitement about the new), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you return home, after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler in a new country needs to adapt.
People don’t necessarily expect patience and understanding when they return home.
The Pyramid’s sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of the sound and the light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The largest of these is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano’s flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbor area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the peninsula's mountains meet on the plateau and form the Ellsworth Mountains' 360 km long chain, which is divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a cell phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions in need of remote data and speech.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One option that is becoming more and more popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising on their education.
In many cases, a course abroad in your gap year can actually improve your chances of getting a place on a higher education program in your home country.
Typically, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these training programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailors. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes as well as in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, you get a different experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days where you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven’t flown before or if they’ve experienced a traumatizing event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens in flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or not having control.
Delivery companies charge well for delivering quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent things via air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to get through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don’t allow them to send baggage without a passenger. That’s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put a big pile of money in front of the opportunity (or better yet, get your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the economy class standard price for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need to look for discounts at all on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting there quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the country's second largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and bustling trading town nestled around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade buildings and modern shopping malls are surrounded by traditional red-tiled roofs, the old 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsv<0xC3><0xAD>k overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some gravestones.
It is worth spending half an hour walking around the exciting village.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which was made famous among foreigners after a laudatory account of its magnificence by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can also visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (altar) which is the site of world-famous Marian spirits.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, a place that is of crucial importance to a large part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Does not embarrass the site with markings or by incising graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona’s official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan because it has been established by law as the official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used, in public transport and other facilities.
General announcements in the metro are only given in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are announced via an automatic system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often only an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible, you need to behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-behaved). It will make it considerably easier to get around.
The cool exterior of Paris evaporates quickly if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forested areas - mainly beech and conifers - and offers a mix of both alpine plants and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types, and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animals and bird species.
Here, along with many more common species, one finds rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and bull.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have headscarves for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially some with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so maybe you are not quite comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of a great deal of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and any kind of available accompaniment such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word “Sie” for you, always begin with a capital letter, also in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects
It undoubtedly also makes reading easier, though writing complicates some of the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a nounized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the subsequent vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly common grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
People who know a little Spanish, however, can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that you do not have to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not such a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Looking at blossoming cherry trees, known as hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from plum trees were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor for only himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, therefore you must resist the temptation to “just take one sample”.
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect “samples”.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when you’re in the “high tropics,” just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll have to deal with both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
There are also a few buses that run north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Be sure to check if the bus you are considering taking is driving into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, to visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, to go on cruises to interesting cities on the Danube or to sail along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian lands and non-Christians from all over the world have embraced many of the holiday traditions.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night to watch the sunrise in an exposed place.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity.
The more traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, where congregations often break out to celebrate the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grass-eating animal on the Galapagos.
Since the first humans came to the Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit arctic or antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see aurora as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since there are not many people living in the areas, and therefore light pollution is often no problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business clothing, and colleagues address each other by their last name or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important, thus emphasizing group effort rather than praise of individual performance.
Workers often need their superiors to approve all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors’ instructions without asking questions.
