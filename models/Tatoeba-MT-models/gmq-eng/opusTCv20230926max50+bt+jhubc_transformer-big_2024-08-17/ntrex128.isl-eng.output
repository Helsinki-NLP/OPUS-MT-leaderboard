A lot of people are worried about “looking like a fool.”
Uggur is in some councillors because of a proposal to have their title changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Concerns have been raised over plans to change the name of the council to the Welsh parliament.
Officers from all parties are concerned that this could make them laugh.
One Labour councillor said his party was concerned that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers living outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means mad and pwp means faecal matter.
A Plaid Cymru official said the party as a whole was "unsatisfied" and made other suggestions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party had an "open mind" about the name change, but pointed out that there was not much difference between the word MWP and Muppet.
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to u in Icelandic.
The council, which is now working on a bill to introduce the name changes, said: “The final decision on all names held over members of the council will, of course, lie with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Government the power to change its name.
In June, the Council released the results of a public opinion poll, which showed strong support for calling the Council a Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of councillor, the council chose WMP (Welsh Parliament Members) as the MWP received the most support from the public in the polls.
According to news reports, councillors are now making other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, to submit a bill for the changes within a few weeks.
The bill on the reform will also include other changes to the way the Council works, including rules on the dismissal of councillors and the organisation of the committee system.
Councillors will be able to cast a final vote on their title when the debate on the bill begins.
Macedonians vote in elections to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country into the “Republic of North Macedonia.”
This case was put to a vote in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own region named Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its neighbours in the north equals the claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who disagreed with the vote on the name change, has said he will not consider the election to be valid.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, have said the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells are being silenced by Harlem churches
“The elders I’ve spoken to said that in the past you could find a bar and a church on every street corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“No one can find it today.”
He said it was understandable that the number of bars would fall.
“People have other ways to meet,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the hubs of the neighborhood where people get together on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect “and sooner or later they will be back at the starting point.”
He added that churches could possibly be replaced by residential buildings full of people who will not help save the remaining shelters in the vicinity.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will turn white,” he said, “and will therefore accelerate the permanent closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of blacks – the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church a decade later.
In the 1930’s, the original white Methodist congregation moved away.
The black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
The Black Congregation took over St. Martin’s Church under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative to bypass merchants on Harlem’s 125th Street, the main shopping street, who wanted to hire or raise black workers.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but members of the congregation of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild it and also had the game built.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Reverend Johnson, proudly called the game “the clocks of the poor people.”
The expert who played the game in July called it a “cultural treasure” and a “unique historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first time a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played the game, but he moved to a larger church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not had anyone else in his place.
Over the past few months, numerous architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders and others by the diocese.
The church council – which oversees the parish and is appointed church leaders – wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that the diocese “would seek to pass the cost on to” the church council, even if it had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Who Dived for Lobster in California
A 13-year-old shark was attacked by a 13-year-old boy and injured on Saturday as the boy was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then rowed across with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just a thrill to have caught a lobster, but then "it became clear that the boy was shouting, 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
All his bones were torn apart,” Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I shouted at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he was seriously injured.
It is not known what type of shark attacked the boy.
The head of the Coast Guard, Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a more dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious injury to his upper body.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security purposes.
Giles said there were over 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to expand into the UK’s cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with mall-style cosmetic shelves and specially trained assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter the UK cosmetics market worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn and growing while sales of fashion and household products are declining. The larger cosmetic shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be installed in more stores next year if successful.
Investing in cosmetics is part of a supermarket’s path to using shelf space that was previously utilized by televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s is set to double its cosmetic portfolio to up to 3,000 products, including brands including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get extra space with marked areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The store also plans to re-launch the sale of its Boutique cosmetic range so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers are demanding it to an ever-greater extent.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test product stands at two of Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon in south London last week and the next will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the increased tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food daily in neighborhood stores mean that supermarkets need to make more effort to get people to come to them.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe said the stores would increasingly resemble shopping malls as the retail chain tries to combat the low-priced Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat stores since both chains were purchased two years ago. According to them, this has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The store’s first attempt to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments did not succeed.
Sainsbury’s tested a partnership with Boots around the year 2000, which ended in a dispute over how to share the proceeds of drug sales in supermarkets.
The move follows Sainsbury’s selling its 281 drug stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd’s, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Under the policy, Lloyds will have a role in these programmes by adding a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to its four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s marketing director, said: “We’ve revolutionized the look of our cosmetic shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be on hand for advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need. Fascinating surroundings and convenient locations make us an exciting beauty shop that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'outrageous' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became "outrageous" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their household products and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, a 37-year-old presenter on the show This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with a sore forehead by dropping out of a popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones has been “continuously busy” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the popular TV host admitted she didn’t have enough time for the household goods and accessories brand Truly due to the new deals worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The company has been compared to Goop, brand name Gwyneth Paltrow, and was intended to double Willoughby’s assets, with an estimated value of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she intended to pull out of Truly, Jones flew from the UK to stay at one of many of her summer homes.
A source said: “Truly was at the top of Holly’s list of priorities.
This was to be her future project that would earn her income for the next two decades.
Her decision to leave was completely ignored by everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line went to market.
There is a full stock of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to go on sale."
Experts believe that the demise of This Morning, one of the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the company millions as a result of heavy product investment, ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household products, and potentially cause further delays in the product line going on sale.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as Chairman of the Board in March.
The couple spend their summer vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin, a television production company.
Willoughby will be the official representative for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin as I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to say anything about his business.”
It’s been a long time, and then we fell in love.”
He was intrigued by the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for a president, and for being so positive towards North Korea’s leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, echoing a reporter’s voice.
“I haven’t left anything behind.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, talks on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top ambassador, told international leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received a “appropriate response” from the United States to North Korea’s first steps towards nuclear disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continued to support commercial farmers in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very close to North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Our relationship is great.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results – missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the earthly remains of American soldiers had been returned home.
He also defended his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there,” Trump said.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia wreak havoc on the island, hundreds have perished
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, an international relief organization was told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to flee their homes, an emergency was not declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid operations there.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for help from international organizations, so this is difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear when foreign aid workers will be able to start work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the country’s disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations should be allowed to help with the relief effort.
Given the prevalence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is woefully ill-prepared to defend itself against the forces of nature.
The tsunamis have been built in Aceh, but they are rare sightings on other coastlines.
It appears that the lack of tsunami protection whistles in Palu has further increased casualties, even though a warning has been issued.
Even in the best of circumstances, it can be a challenge to travel between the many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A hospital ship that has been docked in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it the focal point of his campaign to reform Indonesia’s degraded transportation system, and he has put a lot of money into roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, has plagued Mr Joko's administration, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to deal with persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted more conservative religious policies.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as the Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equals Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday’s game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a transmission from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal when his team was down 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried a shot to the goal in the direction of the far pole.
The ball flew high above the goal and toward its right corner.
The ball finally went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get to this position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as far as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could,” said Sturridge.
“I saw Kante come and touch once and didn’t think much about it, I just took the shot.”
Chelsea were over 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the move, the Chelsea striker handed the ball with a heel kick to Mateo Kovacic and then bounced from midfield to Liverpool's half of the game.
Kovacic allowed the ball to move quickly between the midfielders.
Then he sent the ball forward brilliantly and sent Hazard in for a penalty.
Hazard ran away from defenders and scored in the far corner with a left-footed shot past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the semi-finals of the Premier League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after tsunami in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to a report from the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a press conference that a large number of people had been buried when buildings collapsed in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale. The earthquake caused tsunamis that reached heights of up to 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 a.m. near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to come forward if they saw or heard anything.
Brian O’Hagan, a senior investigator, said: “The investigation is well underway, but I would like to ask anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
“Also, I would like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have captured something on camera with their car cameras to contact us, because they might have important information for our investigation.”
Police have confirmed that the woman who died was in Birkenhead and was found inside an apartment.
This afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman came to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police say they are working to let the victim’s closest relatives know.
A cab driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours could pass before they are allowed back in.
A policeman was heard telling a man that the whole area was now considered to be a scene of crime.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the marked area of the police station and one car just outside it.
A number of police officers stood within the marked area and watched the apartment buildings.
Anyone who might have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact anonymously the Crime Line at 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 from September 30.
The British Parliament’s statue of Cromwell is the latest monument accused of “rewriting history”.
The statue’s ban would be a poetic justification for the destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious gems by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, said that Mr. Crick's proposal was "a fake" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the ongoing debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be attacked.
The English Civil War was neither an order nor an exercise of Cromwell's authority.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the preceding century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a symbol of the spirit of the 19th century and is part of the history of a man who many believe does not yet deserve praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps rather late in the 19th century than today, to have been the patron of Parliament against external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
There is still a lot of historical dispute as to whether this description is in any way correct.
However, it is certain that the conflicts that existed in the middle of the 17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known individual who represents one aspect of their conflict.
It is worth paying tribute to and remembering his achievements as the protector of the state."
A pig attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him.
A pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him in a market in southwest China, according to local news.
The man, whose last name is only “Yuan,” was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered with blood near a stake in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to news from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject a vaccine into pigs in a pigsty on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He had traveled with his uncle from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the uncle found him dead and saw that a door into a nearby pigsty stood open.
He said that inside the pool there had been a big boar with a bloody mouth.
A court investigation confirmed that the 250 kg boar had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My uncle’s legs were bloody and wounded,” the uncle, surnamed “Wu,” told the Guiyang Evening News news agency.
Security camera footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it did not attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence on the scene.
According to news reports, the Yuan family and the owners of the market are in talks on compensation for his death.
There are recorded cases of pigs attacking people, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, 300 kg of pig squeezed a Welsh farmer’s tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood taste can arouse aggression in them.
“They’re just playing.
They like to snap and are curious... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
“You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains across the southwestern part of the United States
As predicted, the intensity of Hurricane Rosa is decreasing as it passes over cooler seas off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall that could cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa became a category 1 hurricane with winds of 136 km per hour, at 5 a.m. to east coast time on Sunday, and it was located just over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is scheduled to go north on Sunday.
At the same time, a tropical storm is forming over the Pacific Ocean and it will head east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will therefore accompany a large tropical cyclone in a northerly direction into the southwestern part of the United States.
Roses will accompany up to 25 cm of rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical rains will mix with the lowlands that are approaching and will form large and widespread precipitation over the southwestern part of the country in the coming days.
Local 2.5 to 10 cm precipitation can cause dangerous flash floods, movement of soil and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some places in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
There is a possibility of flash floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersion of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised against walking into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms can result in strong winds and dust storms.
The basin that is approaching will carry a local downpour in certain areas along the southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of precipitation, which could cause slight movement of soil and slippery roads.
This is the region's first rainfall during the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rain forests will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before precipitation spreads over a larger area late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will cover four states on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Temperatures are expected to change rapidly in October across the US as the Arctic continues to cool, but the tropics remain relatively warm.
Sometimes this can cause high temperature fluctuations over short distances.
A good example of this is the heat in the United States on Sunday.
There is a nearly 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer moths will try to build up and disperse again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to warm in October, with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the southern plains to the northeastern states.
The temperature could go up to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have been arrested for questioning Brett Kavanaugh.
Over 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct that was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s. The testimony was broadcast on six different channels.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, and television stations interrupted the regular schedule to release the latest news on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake proposed a bill to allow the FBI to investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had touched her drunk and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was confident that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen said they watched on Friday.
The company measured average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other TV channels showing the interviews, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people’s views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to a football final or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the interviews, which took all day, on the Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million. Opinion polls of that channel have loyally supported Kavanaugh’s nomination.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was the center of the game on Friday.
After the Republican Party's office announced that he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, CNN and CBS filmmakers captured footage of him on Friday morning as he tried to get into an elevator to meet with the Judiciary Committee.
He stayed down for a few minutes while it rained heavily on CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right here in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
People said to him, “You have authority while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would comment further at the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations were all live when the Judiciary Committee decided whether to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, which a minority of Democrats have called for.
Flake was convinced in part after conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other senators after that.
Flake’s vote was crucial because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has authorized the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh’s allegations.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘being in a political game’ over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “being in a political game” about Britain’s future and undermining the country’s interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was published alongside her interview on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson conceded to the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said the proposal that Britain and the European Union should charge each other tariffs was “absolutely absurd”.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested one suspect in Wayde Sims' death in a deadly shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police.
Officials posted a video of the clashes between Sims and Simpson, saying Sims had lost his glasses during the clashes.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS' sister company WAFB.
Police say Simpson confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
According to his lawyer, there was a guarantee of 350,000 dollars.
The Bureau of Forensics in East Baton Rouge County released a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and down the throat.
Authorities thanked the Louisiana Police Department, the Police Crime Investigation Bureau, the Southern University Police Department and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that led to his arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement officers for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two-meter forward grew up in Baton Rouge where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and took 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "saddened" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“It’s something you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcanoes spewing ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The U.S. National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater, and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center observed vibrations and tremors from the volcano.
Social media images showed a thin layer of ash on car windows in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo”, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists just before the anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands took part in protests on the first anniversary of the disputed Catalan election to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned riot police with eggs and threw powder paint that formed dark clouds of dust in the streets, which were usually otherwise full of tourists.
Fighting also broke out later that day and police used batons to keep the clashes under control.
Separatist groups shouted, “We will not forget and we will not forgive,” for a few hours, while their opponents shouted, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were in need of care for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions continue to mount in the autonomous region one year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by the Madrid authorities, but was welcomed by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but participation was poor as most of those opposed to segregation ignored the elections.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop polling stations across the region, causing a conflict.
Groups of independents had stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent protests in support of the country’s police.
The protest march took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, joined a separatist protest with his wife, saying he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy about being able to get married, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a necessary but narrow victory in regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep up steam this year, as many of their best-known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial due to their role in the planning of the vote and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the protest in support of the police on her phone, said the politicians of both sides had called for the dispute.
“The tension is increasing all the time,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison and awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“My campaign in the European elections is the best way to condemn the democratic regression and the repression that we have seen the Spanish government apply,” he said.
Londonderry man arrested after car was driven into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly driving to a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Bob Blemmings, an investigator, said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that a crossbow was shot in the direction of the vehicle.
Menga scores in Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal secured Livingston's win
Livingston's team, who came from the lower division, put the Rangers on an open shield and Steven Gerrard suffered his second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Mark Dolly Menga and Gary Holt's team are now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team has not yet won the Premier League title this season and will play Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still unbeaten in the league with six wins, and Holt head coach has not yet had to experience a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunities Against Bitless Guests
Holt's team should have been over long before it scored a goal, but their directness caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot a pass after rushing through the defence to receive a cross-target baldness transmission from Graig Halkett.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them in quietness, knowing that they could cause the visitors trouble in the right places.
And that’s how the important goal was scored.
The Rangers received a free kick and Livingston worked to create a goal-scoring opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga, who took over the sending-off and scored from mid-sentence.
At that stage, Rangers had control of the ball but the local defense was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper, did not have to put much effort.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was intercepted by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow fired from a goal after Livingston's move.
The bout ended in Livingston's penalty spot but was kicked off, and two penalty shootout claims – following Halkett's defense against substitute Glenn Middleton, and one after his hand – were dismissed.
"Beautiful" at Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Great performance and results for Livingston.
For the average person, they performed wonderfully and continued to exceed all expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and teammates have hardly changed since they made it back to the top division, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for having polished the team together since their arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was extremely good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes the entire time.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s command, they played well below expectations.
They failed to finish their offense and managed to open the home half only once, so this should be a wake-up call for Rangers currently sitting in the middle of the league.
Erdogan gets mixed receptions in Cologne
It was a smiley and bright sky on Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the two nations.
There have been disputes over issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, huge mosque.
The city is home to most of the Turkish population outside of Turkey itself.
Police used security measures to prevent 25,000 people from congregating in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also voiced their condemnation of both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
The two protest groups reflect how controversial this guest is, but he is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Deptford cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics provided care, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash occurred months after another cyclist was killed in a collision when a driver drove off on Childers Street, one mile (1.6 km) from Saturday’s crash site.
Police said they were working to identify the man and let his family know.
The road has been closed and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured in riots
Six prison guards were injured when riots broke out in a male security prison, according to a report from the prison administration.
Riots broke out at Worcestershire’s Long Lartin Prison at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still raging.
"Tornado" special forces have been called to the area to try to contain the riots, which eight detainees are engaged in, and are only in one wing of the prison.
The guards were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison administration said: “Specialized prison guards have been called out to deal with incidents that are ongoing in Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees were injured due to the incident.
No violence has passed in our prisons and we take it clear that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind bars.”
Over 500 prisoners are held in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden had to go to the hospital after the prisoner attacked him.
And in October last year, riot police were called on the scene to deal with a serious disturbance of peace, in which workers were attacked with billet balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (desiccated areas could benefit)
Tropical depressions are rare in Arizona, but they are likely to occur early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest with the risk of flash floods.
The country’s Bureau of Meteorology has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is scheduled to cross Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter that only “ten hurricanes have sustained enough strength to be classified as tropical storms or depressions less than 200 miles (320 km) from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border.
The latest forecasts from the country's hurricane center forecast 5-10 cm precipitation, with occasional precipitation up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Precipitation is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwest, including the central parts of the Rockies and the Great Basin, with the possibility of occasional precipitation of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of a flash flood, the rains from Rosa could be a blessing, as there is a lot of drought in the area.
Although flooding can cause great damage, some of this rainfall will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought watchdog, there is at least a very high drought rate in over 40 percent of Arizona, but it’s the second-highest party,” according to news from weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 136 km per hour, Rosa is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels in a northerly direction at 19 km/h.
The storm passes over a cooler sea in the Pacific Ocean, and its power diminishes.
He is therefore expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon on Monday or Monday evening.
High precipitation is possible in some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
"We expect precipitation of 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm precipitation," said a statement from weather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. She will then continue up through Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The main hazard expected to arise from Rosa or its remains is extreme rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert region of the United States,” said the country’s hurricane center.
This precipitation is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and movement of soil in the desert, and creep in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be “steady”.
One 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
Police have called witnesses who may have phone records of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh “had to feel the evil and anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the Democratic Party’s ruthless and disgraceful practices,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “had to feel the evil and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday that he denied allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified to the committee about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans have seen the genius and the human qualities and the courage" of Kavanaugh the other day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an impressive record as a civil servant,” he told a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the midterm elections.
"It's five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I don’t do it, but I really do,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going to go out there and fight for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats were working to “defeat and prevent.”
The first key vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s nomination is due to take place no later than Friday, according to a Republican supporter.
Hundreds of people died after an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of dead is likely to rise
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away as huge waves washed up on the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami swept across the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters high surged on the beach at sunset, flushing scores of people out to sea and destroying everything that happened to them.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake that hit Richter with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat hit yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they lost their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on the land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open ocean at 800 kilometers before crashing on the beach.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs, published by the disaster agency, showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and disused bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to ride across the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was observed in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Institute of Food and Technology, in a statement, said the energy released during the big earthquake on Friday had been about 200 times greater than from the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "significant" and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under a barracks from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and property damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the source of the earthquake.
Communication "lies completely down and no information is received" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not noting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although official representatives said the waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, one could be heard shouting from the upper floor of the building to warn the people on the street below that a tsunami was approaching.
A few minutes later, the floodwaters hit the beach, carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that hindered communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to organize relief efforts.
The military has begun sending aid planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped from the area still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for aid operations and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit Palu’s refugee centers on Sunday.
The death toll exceeds 800 after a tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala has reached the city of Palu, where it takes shelter in the tent cities that were set up in the park outside their offices. A mass destruction hit them on the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“People said they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Aid groups have begun difficult relief efforts, but some have complained that foreign aid workers with a high level of expertise were barred from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only start arriving if the accident area is declared a disaster area.
It has not been done yet.
“This is still a local accident site,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open up for foreign aid, but no declaration has been made yet.”
As the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and their families, still missing, held out in the hope that their loved ones would become one of the miracle stories that shed hope on the devastating headlines accompanying natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued.
On Sunday, aid workers rescued a woman who had been trapped in rubble for two days with her mother’s body by her side.
Gendon Subandino, coach of the Indonesian glider team, had coached two missing sailors for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped inside the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with a long experience in gliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that in the hours after news was received within the glider group that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed, he had sent WhatsApp messages in desperation to the contestants staying in Palu and taking part in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a grey signal, instead of blue.
“I think that means the message wasn’t received,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 to top up an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed 26,750 dollars from an employee of Brink, who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport Police.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM machine at the amusement park and was about to put more money on it, said Dennis McCarthy, a police officer, in the announcement.
As he was doing his work, another man came "running behind the Brink employee" and stole a money bag intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not give up how many were involved in the case.
Those who may have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police Department by telephone at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: “The creature formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi on the show, but she quit for "emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
West has previously said that this name has religious significance for him, but it is also an abbreviation of his current name.
“I think ‘ye’ (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year when discussing the name of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, this is us.
It went from Kanye, meaning the one, to just Ye – being a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former colleague of West’s, has also written his name both with and without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's president vowed not to use military force against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexico’s president-elect, has vowed never to use force against civilians, as the country will soon commemorate the 50th anniversary of a bloody day of revenge against students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers launched a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to assist young people in Mexico by giving all students a monthly scholarship and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
With China becoming increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the money it spends on research in the field, says inventor and artificial intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after different departments of the U.S. government issued announcements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no formal overall plan for artificial intelligence.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be in the first place in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the capital that goes into artificial intelligence research, given that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we’re waiting to see the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Doubling the capital could double the chances of the next big discovery in artificial intelligence being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies.
He worked on artificial intelligence systems in the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won America's best player at Othello, and later served as executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese department at Google.
Lee talked about previous tech competitions, which were held by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Robotics Competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to spot the next entrepreneurs.
Scientists in the United States often have to put a lot of effort into getting funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that captures the main ideas, but the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university geniuses to work on artificial intelligence over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States in strengthening its artificial intelligence research.
“I think that those who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should be granted a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China’s parliament released its future artificial intelligence plan in July 2017.
The China Institute of Natural Sciences provides funding to people who work at university institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up an artificial intelligence center, designed to partner with both the industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it invests over $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, US legislation, which was supposed to create a security council on artificial intelligence, has not progressed for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia” in an attempt to resolve decades-long disputes with Greece, which has blocked their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a region called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbours to the north is equivalent to a claim on their territory and therefore denied them membership of NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonia’s population of Slavic origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote, and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum needed for the vote to be considered valid.
The question on the ballot paper is: “Do you want to join NATO and the EU by agreeing to the deal with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say this is a fair fee for Macedonia to join alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will abide by it and bind it in law.
The name change would require the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The election committee said nothing unusual had been reported at 1 a.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last general election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum on whether to change the country’s name, which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, worked to prepare a small field and set up chairs in front of tents that had been erected by those who will ignore the vote.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads held high, not go through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go back to another country like China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary funds to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
“I think by far the majority will agree that over 80 percent of the country’s population is in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said consent would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published Monday by the Macedonia Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another poll from Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would say yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote is not passed, it could mean the first serious blow to the government’s policy, which is in favor of the West, since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all the defense of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made it easy for Brighton to beat Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a transmission in the middle of the field at the start of the offensive.
He bounced past three Brighton defenders and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-clad defenders.
He passed one defender and then ran away a few more right next to the penalty area of Brighton.
Then he turned to the left and found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch within the penalty area to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play against Brighton's Mathew Ryan, with a shot in the right side of the goal.
"Aguero has some foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the Premier League.
Mark arrived in the 29th minute.
Aguero was sent deep into the half of Brighton in that attack.
He sent a beautiful long ball to Leroy Sane's left side.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent for Sterling towards the far pole.
City's forward sent the ball into the net just before it ran out.
City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a knockout game against the Rockies
Since the Nationals have been excluded from playing in the finals, there was not much reason to force another start.
But the frantic Scherzer hopes to get to pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to make it to the finals, but they have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western League.
The Rockies got at least a wildcard spot with their 5-2 win at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still striving to achieve their first league title.
“Even if we play for free, we can at least play for the electrifying atmosphere of Denver and the other team will definitely be playing their best game of the year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in such a situation?”
The Nationals are yet to announce who will be the first pitcher in Sunday’s game, but it’s thought they’ll have Scherzer pitched under these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting the game 34th time, took a practice run on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday which is normally his rest day.
Washington’s right-handed thrower is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 blows in 220 2/3 rounds this season.
Trump to visit West Virginia
The president implicitly referred the case to Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the midterm elections.
“It’s all over in November.
It’s five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones... I don’t run, but if I do, that’s why I’m going all over the world to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible, radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to take back power by whatever means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, over whom they have to go to gain power and control, they just want to get power and control, we don’t give it to them.
He said Democrats were working to “defeat and prevent.”
“And it’s been seen for the last four days,” he said, saying Democrats are “angry and wicked and cruel and untrue.”
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and was greeted with a loud squall from the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Were you the one who broke the record?
Ha, what.
No, no. I waited for one... it was really bad body language, the worst I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a tolerant church.
He does not hate those who speak their mind.
When I was approached by a friend of mine, I was hardly surprised.
I am, after all, the last of many Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our thoughts.
Joan Ryan, my fellow Member, was similarly treated because she strongly opposed prejudice against Jews.
In my case, the suggestion to reprimand me was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, ironically similar to issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to leave no stone unturned and to be successful.”
In my eight-year career as a Labour MP, Friday’s meetings have often been just that.
Unfortunately, that’s not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of “milder and better” politics has been forgotten, if it ever started then.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions have not been passed in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged by whether the party’s leaders consider them acceptable.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, who I previously thought had similar political views as I did, began to expect me to take a complete turn and support opinions that I had previously never agreed with, whether it was about national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak in public—and no matter what I say—there follows a rampage of abuse on social media that calls for my expulsion, denies central politics, and tells me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
I know I’m luckier than some of my colleagues, as most of the comments I get are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and firmness of those who have to endure the throes of sexual or prejudiced insults daily but never retreat.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a more tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a tolerant church, and with every disbelief or change in election rules, the party becomes ever narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the past two years to be lighthearted, not overly loud, and then I’d be ‘all right’.
But I didn’t want to get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the negligence of Thatcher’s government, which left my classroom in ruins, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most, whether I was in town or in parliament.
I’ve never been to the polls, not even in my last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy views and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country heads towards Brexit, which will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to Labour leaders.
But the only message I want to send is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those in my constituency, whether they are Labour members or not: I proudly serve you, and I promise that no threats of eviction or political expulsion will deter me from doing what I believe is in the best interests of you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's undefeated team goes to the top
Two late touchdowns may have skewed the final score somewhat, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserved the win in this hilarious match of the day in Tennent’s Premiership league.
They are now at the top of the list and one of the ten teams that are still unbeaten.
Ultimately, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the locals more successful and Coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“We’ve had a lot of opposition in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Ayr deserved to be commended, they took their chances better than we did,”
Mark Grant Anderson came Ayr over on 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned the attack around, but a yellow card on the Scottish captain, who was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers count and Jason Baggot managed to score a touchdown.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty before scoring with a kick just before halftime and then a touchdown and Ayr came over 17-5 at halftime.
However, Melrose began the second half with power and Patrick Anderson's touchdown after Baggot turned the ball over, reducing the score to five points.
A long pause was then needed to heal a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to leave the field, after which Ayr increased his lead with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the offense around.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson then received the yellow card and Melrose took advantage again of being a man over with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a tough pass.
However, the home side came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for attacking Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr, after a free kick.
Climo turned the offense around, as he did again immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe caught David Amrstrong's kick from penalty spot and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchdown goal.
Star Still Game of the season ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears ready to move into restaurant business after discovering he was hired as a restaurant manager.
Kieran, 56, plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC series The Popular, which he writes and plays in with his old entertainment partner, Creg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be their last, and it appears that Kiernan has plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn’t want to say anything about the story, but a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to take part in a “live restaurant business” in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": The uncharted country of Bolivia hopes that a court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Seamen guard the naval headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River carry the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It’s our responsibility to get it back.”
Throughout all the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century is still fresh in my mind – along with the desire to sail through the Pacific once again.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1, after five years of litigation.
“Bolivia possesses the power, the spirit of unity and serenity, and of course waits for the ruling with a positive mind,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a diocesan diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the court in The Hague will rule Bolivia in favor of their claim that Chile is obliged to grant Bolivia access to the sea, after many decades of difficult talks.
The ruling on Monday is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the nation of Native Americans who will have a contentious battle for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court ruled in favor of Bolivia, and that it would make little difference if he did.
The court, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands, has no power to grant land from Chile and has ruled that the ruling will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the court’s ruling comes just six months after listening to the final speeches indicates that the issue “hadn’t been complicated,” said Paz S<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been a factor in Bolivia’s progress, but rather that they have caused the country to decline.
“The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’s harsh rhetoric has detracted from Chile’s goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, the former president of Bolivia and the country’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open a new relationship with Chile” and an opportunity to “end a dispute that spans 139 years, both countries benefiting,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue as a political stunt.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear weapons unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said the country would never take down its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri made his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on the promises it made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be reopening talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is “dreamers” to think that continued U.S. trade talks and protests against the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington will not approve the declaration unless Pyongyang takes clear action to dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Both Donald Trump and Kim would like to meet again.
However, there are strong doubts that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of large headwear that will come in fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed off a variety of weird oversized hats for their SS19 line on the fashion scene that charmed the jet crew at Paris Fashion Week.
Numerous images of very awkward hats have been published on Instagram this summer and these designers have had their innovative creations on display at fashion shows.
The main work by Valentino was a large light brown hat with wide stripes that resembled feathers and covered the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons set with gemstones, a satchel hat, and even a pineapple, but these items are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One mask resembled a diving device with a breathing tube and glasses, while the other resembled melting ice in bread form.
If you want to get into fashion, you’re in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats may soon be on sale in boutiques near you.
Large hats are coming close to the heels of “La Bomba”, a straw hat with over 60cm large straps that has adorned heads from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion label behind the very awkward hat, which was seen on all social media, was the inspiration for another large accessory that appeared on the fashion scene – a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model that carried it.
The orange striped dress, with a striped and white leather handle, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 fashion line Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the stylist of the famous people, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in fashion stores for next summer – as the designer has made such a huge impact, it should be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding performance of their students and it has continued in 2018 with new, impressive test results, which are still supported by individual and group results in sports, arts, music and other social disciplines.
These schools have up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in charge of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further postgraduate studies, the career they have chosen and their status as a global citizen.
As a teaching sector that can put together and teach by specially designed curricula, we see that new language continues to be a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it touches his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can’t just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The test results this year show us that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest percentages of students achieving exams in private schools.
Sixty-eight per cent of students who studied a foreign language received a grade of A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students received a grade of A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received an A grade.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a necessary skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
At the moment, languages, as an elective subject, are placed in the same position as science-related study material (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of private schools and elsewhere.
An opinion poll conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that, for the reasons given by employers to be difficult to recruit, 17 percent were due to a lack of people with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future jobs.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career they choose, they will have a real advantage in the future if they learn a second language, which is a skill that will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will provide a multilingual character with an automatic advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 adult Britons in 2013, 75 percent of them couldn’t speak a second language well enough to sustain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-letter percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children of today to invest immediately in language teaching.
Multilingualism, especially in emerging markets, will give children a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies from school to school.
A certain number of schools will focus on more classic new languages, while others will teach languages that are thought to be most important for the UK as we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, they will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specially trained teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future brings.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, languages continue to be essential for the future of the country, and that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be seen as “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer choices, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the President of the Scottish Private School Council.
LeBron will play his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is coming to an end for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It'll be longer than a minute and shorter than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, said on Twitter that James would likely play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule for the start of the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare,” he said.
Timings for Trump’s election rally in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings, the first of which will take place tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendliest locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his choice of a new Supreme Court justice has been put on hold, Trump is aiming to build support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when the vote is taken in November.
What time is Trump’s presidential campaign in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to preside over the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for Supreme Court Justice, where tensions arose over allegations of sexual harassment. The Senate vote to confirm him as a judge was put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main goal of Trump’s meetings is to help the Republicans make a better move, which awaits a tough election in November.
The message from Trump’s campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, are aimed at “filling the enthusiasm of volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and in Congress,” according to Reuters news agency.
“Administration of Congress is so essential to the president’s plan that he will travel to as many states as possible as a busy campaign season begins,” a spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign told Reuters.
The rally tonight will be held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh press will report on him,” according to the West Virginia Metro News agency.
The meeting on Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month, winning by over 40 percent in that state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Republican presidential candidate Patrick Morrissey to the Senate, but he is lower in the polls.
“It’s not good news for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows a fighting spirit to keep hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the quad, which was this afternoon on Saturday, could be exactly what was needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
Fluctuating in success is a sports concept that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like this one.
Where would they say that success lies now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four points, so the success is on our side now, I guess,” Spieth said.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead with an additional twelve at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have a little wind in their sails and they can be hopeful about many things, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played everything from ground to surface and leads by example.
The cheers rose as the ring wore on and he put down an important putt to score all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points down after two games.
His putt, which secured them victory in the 15th hole game, received similar cheers, shouts of the kind that tell you he believes the American team still has a chance to win.
“You just have to dive deep and think about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players can do right now.
18 holes to earn points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but enchanting European couple has won four games out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who got flushed this afternoon on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid flushing on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and on the nine hole course on Friday morning.
That game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud crowd clearly shows that they are the pair to be victorious on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal the European team’s possible victory than Fleetwood or Molinari, as the sun sets over Le Golf National course.
The best option would be for both to do it at the same time in different holes.
It’s still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went easy with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-game morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
With two doubles in the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede dug a hole from which they could never scratch themselves.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and the four-balls are so exciting to watch up close because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give and how a game plan can change in one go.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable advantage for the final day, but this four-game series also showed that the United States team has the fighting spirit that some had doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with a 10-6 lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead for the Ryder Cup final day after a four-ball and Saturday’s fourth, with the lead 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods and four points at Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Bjorns, who would like to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, showed great superiority over the USA in the morning’s four-ball game and won 3-1.
The U.S. faced more opposition in the four games and won two games, but failed to win the score difference.
Team Jim Furyks needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy going.
Fleetwood is the first European freshman to win four consecutive stages and he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a spectacular weekend, are only the second pair to win four stages from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed great team strength and won the downhill of Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius occasionally, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-games, including seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning’s four-ball game, returned to his teammate Henrik Stenson in the four-game series, beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1 – who are in first and third place on the list of the world’s best golfers.
However, not everything went well for Europe on this mild and sunny day south-west of Paris.
Three-time golf champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a goal for the U.S. with two points on Saturday.
They won 2–1 against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball games and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4–3 in the four after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has won a four-point difference at the start of a single-player competition, although Furyks only needed a tie to keep the Cup going.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday will be too much for them.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament 'impossible' without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued trade ban only extends to their distrust of the United States and it was impossible for the country to dismantle its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant steps to show goodwill” over the past year, for example, by halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising to halt the development of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we have not seen any similar reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to unilaterally dismantle our nuclear weapons first.”
While Ri has repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “staged” approach to nuclear disarmament in which North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed specific in that he did not deny unilateral nuclear disarmament outright as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Un’s and Donald Trump’s joint statement at the first meeting of acting US presidents and North Korean leaders, in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work for the “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula,” and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought a solution to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must abandon its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax a strict trade embargo against North Korea.
“The United States is demanding ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and increasing pressure by using a trade embargo to achieve it, and even protesting the declaration to end the war,” Ri said.
“There are only dreamers of people who know nothing about us to think that a commercial farm can get us down.
But the problem is that the continued commercial prayer increases our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about at the UN earlier this week.
Speaking instead of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, the minister added: “If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be a stalemate in the Korean nuclear disarmament issue.”
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech last year was very different when he said at the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to target missiles from North Korea to the US mainland after “devil president” Trump called Kim a “firefighter” in a suicide attack.
Last year, Trump threatened to “deplete” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, saying there was still a lot of work to be done and that a trade ban would have to continue until North Korea had destroyed all of its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s trade ban must remain in place until a complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and it is confirmed.”
The Security Council agreed to increase trade ties with North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but only a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making “criminal demands.”
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear facility if the United States took “corresponding action.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding actions” he sought were assurances of security promised by Trump in Singapore and actions toward normal relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take classes in sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to counteract the increasing tendency of students to stay awake and study all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the world’s best universities often know little or nothing about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea to do the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I being told this first now, in my final year?’
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help learning ability and performance in sports and even contribute to overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the School of Health Sciences, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were very sleep-deprived over the week.
The course is an hour in length and includes various interactive assignments.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students click on a cup of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen with lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good routine for sleep.
In the second part, participants are told how lack of sleep over the long term can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Maps of the school campus with interactive icons then encourage participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students at once.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that celebrates those who stay awake and study all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough good quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid fattening, because sleep deprivation heightens the brain’s call for food so that the body is alert.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, who sat one of the professor’s classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all Master’s students to complete a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them, keeping in mind the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can confuse the internal clock of the body and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
The Rangers were still struggling on the field as Steven Gerrard's disbanded team had to settle for a 1-0 loss at Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
Ibrox's team wanted to achieve their first away win after their win at St Johnstone in February, but team Gary Holt gave Gerrard's team only their second loss in 18 of his games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, who are in the top spot in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and Rangers team seemed to lack all the inspiration and were never likely to level.
The Rangers are now down to sixth, while Livingston is up to third and is only behind Hibernian in goal difference.
Rangers could run into further trouble after the lineman Calum Spence had to get relief for a head injury after some object was thrown at him from the field half of the visitors.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and made it to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same Livi 11 setup that reached the stage of Hearts last week, and he had been pleased with how well-trained his teammates were rolling over the opposition.
Rangers might have had more of the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls they got.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game when the first transmission from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he missed.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free kick ended with Craig Halkett but Alan Lithgow, his defensive partner, shot past the far post.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live on in hope rather than belief in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales felt he should have received a penalty after a quarter of the game, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers only managed to score two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn’t have to worry about defending a head from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi’s opportunity in the 34th minute had come despite the fact that the other team had the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, though only because of their perseverance.
The Rangers again failed to do anything from a long free kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and chose to send to Menga who then scored easily.
Gerrard took control at half-time and sent Ryan Kent in to replace Coulibaly and the substitution had an impact almost immediately when the defender entered Morelos, but Kelly quickly responded and rushed forward to block the shot.
Still, Livingston continued to trick the visitors into playing just the kind of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett got the long haul one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor did well to deny Jacobs an opportunity before Lithgow ran to the mark from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Rangers' deputy, wanted another penalty when he and Jacobs collapsed, but Thomson dismissed it.
Almanac: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here is a page from our calendar "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and today... this is the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity and that invention eventually led to a device called a Geiger meter.
The Geiger meter has gained a solid place in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger detector, used to find radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms because of the radioactivity in the stones."
He said, “It’s really happening right now!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory
Then they can “see” a protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and is then injected back into the patient.
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The procedure involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is found in many types of cancer. The cells are then injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Cancer Society in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that the vaccine is highly effective.”
HER2 “allows various types of cancer to stop growing,” including cancers of the breast, ovaries, lungs, and colon and rectum, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure involving the collection of immune cells from patients who have been "taught" to attack cancer cells has been effective in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long speech in support of Trump and wore a MAGA hat after appearing on the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well
Kanye West on Saturday Night Live after a long speech in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great dercap, he spoke out against the Democrats for a long time and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so many times to white people who say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
If I was worried about racism, I would have been deported from the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a trailer in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's long-lost album was not released, its recording was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
Not sure if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received bad receptions backstage because of his hat-trick.
“I was put in the back seat.
They said to me, “Don’t wear this hat on the stage.”
They beat me up!
Then they say I’m in a deep hole,” he said, according to news from the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the deep hole?” and said that he would put on his superhero costume “because that means you can’t order me to do things. Do you want the world to improve?
“Test the love.”
His remarks were met with a scuffle from the audience at least twice, and SNL’s actors appeared disgraceful, according to Variety, and one of them told the newspaper: “There was a stone silence in the studio.”
West had been invited to replace Ariana Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
Supported by TPUSA leader Candace Turner, West said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SHOWING MESSAGES.”
Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was “simply being himself, and that’s just wonderful.”
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) who I feel supports and propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“We are too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that now he is “the being that was formerly known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and steps in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and not to be forgotten is the music legend Prince the Hot, who changed his name to a symbol and later called himself the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of the Crown Games, criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow on the HBO series The Crown.
The 31-year-old actor, however, has criticized the stereotype of the male hero and says that such roles on screen often mean that young boys feel they have to be hard on themselves to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Crown Princess co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions” on how to deal with this issue.
"Personally, I think at the moment - what has gone wrong with the masculinity?"
“What have we taught men as they grew up, about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to the very male characters on television.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the most important questions of our time – how do we change this?
“Something has gone wrong with young people.”
He also admitted in the interview that he would not appear in any other feature after the show's appearance next summer, saying that he had "enough of battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about having played in the Crown Games was having met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife on these shows, so they gave me some of my future family and my life after that,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow who Kit played in these Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018, on the land of Lesli's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with HIV or with AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections came with sex, which is a change from what was before.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of contaminated blood.
On the other hand, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by about 100,000 each year.
HIV infection caused by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality hasn’t been illegal in China since 1997, but there’s still a lot of discrimination against LGBT people.
Due to conservative values in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections are caused by inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a program to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked data from Republican senators, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
MP Maxine Waters denied Saturday that one of her staff members had published the personal information of three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these claims came from “super-right-wing” extremists and websites.
"Lies, lies and more pathetic lies," Waters said in a statement.
The information contained the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's sexual harassment allegations.
The leak came sometime after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said the IP addresses identifying the source of the information linked to Waters' office and disclosed information about one of its employees, according to information provided by Capitol Hill.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is a completely false and outright lie," Waters said.
“My employee – whose personal data and security are now at risk due to these false allegations – was in no way responsible for this information breach.
This unsubstantiated accusation is absolutely false and outright lies."
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized online, including by Ara Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the guts to sit on the bench.
When someone is accused for no reason, do not react with anger.
There can be no opposition.
You can’t question the motives of the accuser.
We have to show strength and determination.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Kavanaugh’s judges, who critics said appeared to be too angry at Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, Republican candidate against Waters in the midterm elections, also said his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s a big deal if it’s true,” he said.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had “informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officers of these untrue claims.
“We will ensure that the guilty are found,” she continued, “and brought to justice for all the acts that are damaging and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again - a spy film with Rowan Atkinson proves powerless
It’s become a habit nowadays to look for Brexit references in every new film in which the UK comes into play, and that seems to apply in this revival of the Johnny English comedy series – which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and just came back to life in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Will this canker satire on how clearly miserable we are is a new export opportunity for the country?
Whether it is or not, the mischievous, grumpy and clumsy Johnny English has been renewed for a second time to mess everything up - his name shows above all that he is a creation designed for an exhibition in other than English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the witty secret agent who pretends to possess breathtaking character magic but is a little mix of Clouseau, a dab of Mr. Bean and a little scrap of the man who played a note for the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the tourist and mysterious cosmopolitan that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he left everything behind in chaos.
There are one or two good scenes in this latest Johnny English film.
I liked to see Johnny English walking in a helicopter with a medieval coat of mail and his helmet covered with helicopter blades.
Atkinson clearly shows his funny skills, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now that “serious” films such as James Bond and the Mission Impossible films also offer unhesitating fun.
The joke seems to be more for children than adults, and I thought the adventures Johnny English had found himself in weren’t as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent comics in Mr. Bean’s phony.
One of the biggest problems with the film is that Britain is in trouble.
A hacker has managed to break into Britain’s secret intelligence network and uncover the identity of all British spies, much to the chagrin of the on-call spy – one where Kevin Eldon is sadly cast in too small a role.
This is the final straw for the Prime Minister, who is arrogant and controversial in character, and already in a lot of turmoil due to the enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with her role as a character who is supposed to be reminiscent of Theresa May, but the script is not up to many fish for her.
Her advisers tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had been imprisoned.
And there Johnny English himself, now the headmaster of some fine school, comes along, but also provides secret instruction in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers to a spy school reminiscent of the movie School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and there he meets Bough, his former long-suffering partner, whom Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife a submarine captain, but in that energetic role, Vicki Pepperdine doesn’t quite let her light shine.
The espionage team that is messing with Her Majesty’s service has now returned to the gears and met the dangerous Ophelia Bulletovu, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is enthralled by the magic of the enchanting tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: it's the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their rampage: they fire up a fancy French restaurant disguised as waiters, they cause mischief as they sneak into the Volta’s luxury yacht, and English turns everything upside down as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interiors of the Volta’s house.
There is nothing spared in the final scene, but even though the film is lively and energetic, it still distills some of the children’s material in it as a whole.
Medium quality material.
And just like with the other Johnny English films, I could not help but think: can a British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talents?
The Labour Party denies that it is preparing a four-day working week for Britain, with the same pay as it did five days a week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow Britain to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the party, the bosses of companies want to make use of the savings generated by the revolution in artificial intelligence, and let employees benefit by getting one extra day off.
Employees can enjoy three days of long weekends without a reduction in wages.
Sources say the idea would “fit” with the party’s economic plan and its policy of improving the welfare of workers.
Trades Union Congress has supported the shortening of the working week to four days, as a way for workers to take advantage of changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is scheduled to be announced by the end of the year.
“The change will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits in with the party’s approach to changing the economy for the benefit of workers and with the party’s overall industrial policy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 election campaign.
The goal, however, is not short-lived by the Labor Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not on the party’s policy paper and the party is not considering implementing it.”
John McDonnell, the shadow trade secretary, used last week’s Labour conference to outline his ideas for a social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “unknown CEOs” and “gross collectors” of utilities.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back as the Labour government could impose a “deduction” on alleged wrongdoing.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers on corporate board committees and create a joint ownership fund to hand over 10 percent of private company assets to their employees, who could receive <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year in dividends from them in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" of the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could prompt them to change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week-long delay in the final vote on his nomination for Supreme Court Justice, raising the question of whether its findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview airing on Sunday, Rep. John Kennedy and Senator Lindsey Graham asked Scott Pelley, a reporter for the 60 Minutes program, if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when the trial started, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the allegations were made and asked, “Did you do this?”
He was determined, determined, unwavering.”
Graham’s vote, however, appears to be unchangeable.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an incredible accusation to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but here’s what I do know: Brett steadfastly denied it,” Graham said.
“Anyone she named couldn’t confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the International Civil Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York. It is an annual music event where a series of big stars will emerge and with a similarly influential strategy; to end poverty around the world.
This is the seventh year that the International Civil Festival is being held and tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park, not only to listen to music acts from Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to highlight the festival’s real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The International Civil Festival, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international campaign to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get free tickets to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers had to complete various tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to one of the world’s leaders, making a phone call, or using other valid means to help draw attention to their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival been, already 12 years in the making?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free gigs really a way to convince people to call for action, or is this just one so-called “click action” – where people feel they are doing something that matters by signing online petitions or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions” from its supporters, to call for a variety of different goals.
It says these actions have helped get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group counted 390 commitments and announcements for its actions, of which at least USD 10 billion have been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and executive that works to “help children enjoy themselves to the fullest,” and pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 petitions were sent for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a funding project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
In the list of frequently asked questions on the group’s website, one question is: “Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task – sometimes we will fail all the time.
But, we will reach our goal, just like the movements that fought for the rights of citizens and the abolition of racial segregation before us, because we are stronger together.
This year’s event features Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e. The event will be hosted in New York by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy as 'barrier' to hinder Russia's energy exports, says interior minister
“If necessary,” Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s assistance to Syria, especially as the country operates at the invitation of the legitimate government there, was a prelude to exploring a new market.
“I think the reason for their being in the Middle East is that they want to do energy trade, like in Eastern Europe and the South,” he said.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and means to counter it.
“The U.S. can use the Navy to ensure that shipping routes are open and, if necessary, to create barriers to ensure that the energy from them does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed a meeting hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group that calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying it was more or less the same.
“The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation of energy resources and their replacement,” he said, saying Russia has only one card in its arsenal with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes after Trump’s administration wants to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a much cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To do this, officials in Trump’s administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to get Germany to cancel participation in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project to lay a new energy pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline, which will double the transmission capacity of the current pipeline up to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
Russia says Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been criticized by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I am very unhappy that outside states have taken over our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will ‘Seriously Consider’ Running for President in 2020, She Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider running for public office in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and run our government, and then they need a woman to lead,” she said.
“After November 6, I will be seriously considering running for President.”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting, saying he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter that “of course we have to have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote takes place.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that the majority of voters in Warren County do not believe that she should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her candidacy.
The poll showed more support for Deval Patrick, the former governor, with 38 percent saying they support his candidacy and 48 percent saying they oppose it.
Among other popular Democrats discussed for a possible 2020 presidential run were former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about Track Palin’s traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump’s election
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son is going through a lot of difficulties after coming back, I feel with other families who are affected by post-traumatic stress disorder and the mental wounds that our soldiers are returning home with,” she said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room,” saying that her son and other soldiers “come back a little differently, they’re hardened, and they wonder if there’s any respect for what their comrades in the Army and Air Force and other military units have done for the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempting to block a report of domestic violence, and under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support challenge against new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Washington support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing gang or domestic violence for asylum.
Representatives of the 18 counties and the city filed a court report Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposes the policy, according to a report from NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federalism has not been disclosed.
She said her husband "and his violent, gang-member sons" had violently assaulted her, but U.S. government officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems related to gangs and domestic violence are on the rise, with the number of asylum seekers coming to the United States coming from those countries.
The new asylum policy revokes a ruling issued by the Immigration Appeals Committee in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington's Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "overlooked decades of state, federal, and international law."
“Federal law requires that a decision be made on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule,” the court said in a statement.
Lawyers further said in the report that the policy of denying entry to immigrants was harmful to the U.S. economy, arguing that immigrants were more likely to set up a business and “provide important labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence in June.
“Those who leave their homeland for persecution based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum seekers were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people deal with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in a race to find survivors in Palu, as the number of dead doubles
Things are getting harder for those who survived.
“There’s a lot of tension in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sick son in the aid center in the city of Palu.
“There’s always a body coming in here.
There’s not much clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their devastated homes and searching their water-soaked belongings to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overcrowded and damaged after the 7.5-point Richter earthquake.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulders, were outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were encouraged to stay outdoors because of continued vigorous aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I pushed up against the wall debris, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, saying his family had been in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. envoy accuses China of 'persecution' with 'insulting' ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the US newspaper to discuss the mutual benefits of trade between the two countries, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke on Wednesday about the Chinese paper’s advertisement in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s top-selling newspaper — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. general election that will take place on November 6. China denies this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. general election marked what official U.S. officials told Reuters news agency was a new stage in a growing campaign by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is natural for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are engaged in a intensifying trade war, with new tariffs on imports from both countries.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in his opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that “China is now intensifying its persecution by publishing propaganda in our own free media.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the beloved tradition of freedom of speech of the United States and our free media by publishing a jagged ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said in his article.
“On the other hand, there are few voices of protest in Beijing’s newspaper stalls, and no true reflection of the different views that China might have on China’s worrying economic policies, with the media stuck under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the biggest newspapers in China eluded the offer to publish” his article, but he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making female voters dismiss them for the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative responses, especially from women, in the next midterm elections, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, who has been subjected to sexual harassment allegations.
There have been very strong sentiments surrounding this issue and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted to start voting.
“You can’t back down with these things,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that a last-minute call by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow and they won’t forget it in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a spokeswoman for the liberal group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is approaching!” as they protested in the hallways of the Senate when the Republicans in charge of the adjudication committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of the electorate will be overwhelming,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
“People will say that the interest has already been great and that’s true.
But he could be bigger, especially among the female voters in the suburbs and the younger voters, 18-29, who dislike the president, but rarely vote.
Analysts predicted a backlash if Republicans pushed for confirmation of Kavanaugh, even for Ford’s testimony in which she described her allegations of sexual harassment from him.
“It’s become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Still, a former member of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be left on the bench, it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to disagree who to believe after testimony from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a narrow majority supports the latter.
A recent YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or indeed lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's indictment, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 and that she was under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh exposed his genitals in front of her when they were both at a Yale University graduation party in the 1980s.
The Man Who Invented the Internet Has Plans to Start a New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the internet, is going to start a startup company to fight against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech myth, Inrupt, is a company based on the Solid, open platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was “home rule.”
“We have to do this now,” he said of the startup company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses technology from Solid to enable people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
There you can have a list of contacts, to-do list, calendar, music library and other personal and work-related devices.
This means that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is totally up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment using data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to all.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that was acquired by IBM, several programmers who were hired as contractors to work on the project, and a team of programmers on a voluntary basis.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could create their own standalone apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team would not be in talks with Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on its head overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published Saturday on Medium that Inrupt had the goal of “creating energy in business and ecosystems that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he is establishing Inrupt.

Bernard Vann: Honored World War I Victoria Cross Priest and Holder
The only English priest to be honored with the Victoria Cross in World War I as a soldier has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Bernard Vann, who served in the army as a lieutenant colonel, received the Cross on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, a sniper killed him and he was never told that he had been awarded the British Army's highest honour.
Two of his great-grandsons unveiled memorials to him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “wonderfully symbolic” that the memorial was unveiled exactly 100 years from the glory of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Vann led his army across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy gunfire from cannons and machine guns."
Later, he ran to the firing line and with "great courage" led the line forward before attacking the cannon of one of his team and subduing three soldiers.
On 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war, a German sniper killed a colonel-in-chief.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s exploits were “something I could never do, but something that makes you humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also made a wreath of flowers after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt it "a great honour to take part in the parade" and added that "the daughters of a true hero are shown with the support shown by so many."
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, got instead to see Gurru pig
Just imagine, having stayed up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206, only to be refused to see the main event.
The program included 13 fights from San Jose, six of which were on the main program and were broadcast live all night in the UK on the Channel 5 channel.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences received an unexpected response when the broadcast turned into Gurru Pig.
Some were unhappy after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One Twitter fan described the transition to children’s content as “some kind of sick joke.”
“According to official rules, the content wasn’t suitable for the audience at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s content,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
“The pig, yes.”
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator said they would go over their timetables and take the UK audience into account in the future.
“I think when I think about the replay, we could probably sort this out,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday and we can’t solve it until Sunday, which is Monday for them.
But we are working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a lot of text messages were sent back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a public issue.
I promise it won’t happen next time.
We limited the night to five fights instead of six, as usual, but we tried too hard and got out of hand.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Suffered ‘Discomfort’ Due to Sexuality
Olympic athlete Tom Daley said he felt powerless towards other people when he was growing up because of his sexual orientation, but that it encouraged him to succeed.
Twenty-four-year-old Daley said he didn’t realize he was “different” until he went to middle school.
On the radio show Desert Island Discs on the Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope.”
He also said that the parental role has discouraged his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular show host, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley turned up in Laverne's first episode, saying he felt he was a "lesser man" than everyone else when he was a child because "it wasn't accepted in society to be fond of both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t be disappointed when his sexuality finally surfaced.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has made a huge impact as a supporter of LGBT and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he wanted to be heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said it had “surprised him” to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at a young age” – when he participated in his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that “all of his beliefs” had repressed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
Robbie's my Olympic gold medal."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had gotten their tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the first row,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breathing stopped and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, dipping in front of an audience at home in the Olympics. It doesn’t feel like a better feeling,” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15am local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and died sitting on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old rhythms again so that the record is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the 12th record-breaking competition, was placed on the bench at the discretion of captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-game games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has been so many times before for the United States, the day of the five-time champion is divided between being a cheerleader and practicing the tactics on the field in the hope of correcting what ails him.
Mickelson, 48, was never the shot putter, and is not the best player for Le Golf National, where long bunkers often punish for bad shots.
Not only is the golf course a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson will have to compete against British Open winner Frances Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is joined by newcomer Tommy Fleetwood and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below are taking the first game of 12 singles matches, get off to a good start, Mickelson’s game could make a difference.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he could hardly say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back and put his arms around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and he has been such a great remedy for the teams before and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but that’s how it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo’s record in the number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never reached quite as high as other achievements on his record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his presence had a certain vague effect on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s ironic, he’s witty, he likes to make fun of people and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed teasing him this week, too, and it was fun to watch.
He gives so much more than just the game of golf.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe knows that a big advantage can disappear quickly
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good advantage for the last day of the individual competition in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dane first played at Valderrama in 1997, where under the command of captain Seve Ballesteros, he had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but managed to claim the victory in the end with the smallest possible score difference, with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a lot of advantage in Valderrama, we had a lot of advantage in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only just so,” said Bjorn, who is seen here in the picture, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 both on Friday and on Saturday and reaching the lead of 10th Golf.
“The story will show me and everyone on the team that it’s not over.
We're all going forward tomorrow.
Let's go do everything right.
This is not finished until all the steps are on the table.
We have our goal and it’s trying to win this cup, we focus on that
I’ve always said this, I’m focused on the 12 players in our team, but we’re very aware of our opponents in the other team – the best golfers in the world.”
Bjorn was delighted with how his players had fared on a difficult pitch and added: “I never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is going to be different.
Tomorrow, it’s the individual’s performance that matters, and that’s another thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you play one, you’re testing every person’s ability as a golfer.
That’s the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to play his best game himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will seek to make his players perform better in individual games than with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this big transition on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed the “miracle in Medinah.”
“I remember every single damn word,” he replied, when asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had encouraged his players for the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow but you want to start fast like you did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the creeper gets closer to building up, it puts a lot of pressure on the games that are in the middle.
We ranked our players accordingly and let them play as we think they will do best tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the defense and plays against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half.
“I chose these players in this series because I think they cover all the way through,” Bjorn said of his choice of players in the individual competition.
Germany's new warship delayed yet again
The German Navy’s latest warship should have been built in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it won’t be ready until at least next year due to system failure and rising costs, according to news in the region.
The building of the “Rhineland-Palatinate,” the lead ship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to sources from a military spokesman who spoke to the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have been commissioned by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after delivery plaid the project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the warships of the Bremen class, which have come of age.
They should be equipped with a more powerful cannon, many anti-aircraft and naval missiles, and concealment techniques such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signals.
Other important features are the longer service life - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that these warships of the latest type – which are said to enable Germany to show its strength at sea – will already become obsolete when they are finally put into service, says in Die Zeit.
The F-125 entered the news last year when the German army officially refused to take over and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the ship had been returned to the manufacturer.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but German media spoke of a number of women seriously "flaws in software and hardware" that rendered the warship useless if sent to combat.
The flaws in the software were particularly important because the warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be controlled by a crew of 120, which is half the size of the warships of the Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship was far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the navy’s ability to make improvements to it in the future.
The 7,000-tonne vessel Rhineland-Palatinate is estimated to be twice the weight of a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
Apart from hardware flaws, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is starting to cause problems.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 billion), but was originally supposed to be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems facing the latest ships are particularly important in light of the warnings that the German naval superiority is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, admitted that the navy was in fact being “put out of business with capable ships.”
The representative said that the problem had arisen over time, because older ships were taken out of service but no ships came in their place.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg orders could be used by the navy.
The National Trust for Nature Conservation espionage of the secret life of bats
A new study, which is being carried out in the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how bats use the landscape when they hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will look at different types of bats in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the area to monitor the behavior of the bats over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also go on observation tours with hand-held sensors.
Experts will analyze all the recordings to find out the frequency of the calls, which the bats give off, and which species do what.
Maps of habitats and reports will then be issued to create an accurate picture of their behaviour on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results reveal what kind of habitats are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain woodland for bats and other related species.
The number of bats has decreased significantly in the last century in Scotland and throughout the UK.
They are at risk from construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce habitat.
Windmills and lights can also pose risks, including flysheets and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey, because they are used to fishing at night.
They used advanced echolocation technology to find insects and objects that are on their way.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization employs ten experts, who perform regular checks, nest checks, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even established Scotland’s first and only bat farm at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten bat species have homes.
David Thompson, the manager of the farm, says he is the perfect area for them.
“The area here at Threave is great for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and lots of good habitat.
But there are still many unknowns about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of checking bats before maintenance is carried out on farms, as the possible accidental destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young and completely destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, harass or disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how well many of their species are doing.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called allegations against him of rape “fake news” and said people want to “draw attention to themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are going to prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 a day to keep quiet about the incident, according to the Der Spiegel news agency on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers that they were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
This is fake news,” said the five-time world champion.
“These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to become famous using my name, but that’s part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “unacceptable disclosure of a privacy-related suspicion,” according to Reuters news agency.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said Ronaldo would demand compensation for "a perjury of the same amount and seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed before the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was a “99 percent good man” who had fallen into temptation because of the “one percent.”
The documents say Ronaldo agreed to the pair having sex with each other.
Mayorga claims she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries in a hospital, but finally agreed to a reconciliation outside the courtroom because she was “scared of revenge” and worried about being “humiliated in public.”
She says she wants to end the marriage because she is still in a state of shock after an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to have taken place, and this summer he transferred to Italian giant Juve with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain would ‘regret forever’ losing car manufacturers
The UK would “regret forever” if it lost its position as a global leader among car manufacturers after Brexit, said Minister of Trade Greg Clark.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cease production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delaying the border if Brexit without a deal were to become a reality would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My view is that if the UK exits the EU by the end of March, we will see production sites in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without consent about how international trade should be conducted, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW has announced that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say are supply chain risks if a no-deal Brexit becomes a reality.
Toyota’s production line is based on “last minute” delivery, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for cars made to order.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that the industry believes could lead to a delay and a lack of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than the daily stock at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May’s Chequers plan for a future relationship with the EU “is aimed specifically at preventing these views at the border.”
“We have to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will allow us to not only enjoy success in the present, but as an opportunity that we can take advantage of,” he said on the BBC Radio 4 radio show.
“The evidence, not just from Toyota but other manufacturers as well, shows that we need to be able to continue with very successful supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long their production would stop, but warned that in the long run, increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union shop steward at the factory, said that his colleagues were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House announced on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” over the ongoing dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor who investigates Russian election efforts, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstructions of justice by the president.
For weeks, there have been rumours in Washington about whether Trump will impeach the Assistant Attorney General, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein had discussed carrying a tape recorder to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday he visited the White House, including news that he was about to resign.
Trump was scheduled to meet on Thursday at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he “preferably” would not fire Rosenstein, but since then the meeting was postponed until he was not at the same time as an audience with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has accused him of sexual harassment, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sander, Trump’s press secretary, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, she said: “A date has not yet been set for him, it could be this week. I think it is possible that he will be delayed for another week because of everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and it's always a pleasure to inform the media."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not due to dissatisfaction with the fact that the TV newsmen had “showmanship,” but she said, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they have a showmanship.”
She then gave indications that a direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
“The president answers more questions in the media than any other president has ever answered before,” she said, without citing sources: “We’ve gone over these numbers.”
Sanders said, “If the media has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
“We’re trying to do a lot of that, and you’ve seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks, and it’s going to take the place of press conferences when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or media briefings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown that in New York this week, when he was exhibiting rampant and strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Health minister writes to EU staff in Scotland over concerns over Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to NHS Scotland to express its gratitude to the people of Scotland and wish them to continue to work after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter in less than six months until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of licence applications for EU nationals working in the public service sector.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued and a decision is expected in the autumn.
The British government has also been working on preparations if the deal is not possible.
I know this is going to be a tough time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I value the work of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare sector and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is truly your home, and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for the Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 tap game against the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to a report from Tennessean journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there,” Reed said.
Trainers and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was put on a stretcher and carried out for further examination.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, a WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was undergoing surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was "no information on the type or severity of the injury yet" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in his senior year at school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before he left, raising his total tackles to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK. The excess money will be used to help the homeless, according to the Conservative Party’s new plan
The action will negate the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
There will be increased stamp duty on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The government plans to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK. The excess money will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will announce this today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to undo Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising affordable housing and taxing high-income earners further.
Individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK will have to pay higher stamp duty, and the excess money will go into government action to help the homeless.
The increase – which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the increase imposed two years ago on extra homes and real estate purchases for rent – could be up to three percent.
The government estimates that the increase will generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new construction in London is bought by foreign parties, which causes a price increase and makes those who want to buy real estate for the first time more difficult to enter the market.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” due to the number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel affordable home quotas to fix Britain’s “property shame.”
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of notable improvements to housing, including rental controls and the end of rental housing free of charge.
He also wants to give the council more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate myself to a revival of the British dream in my first season – that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our useless real estate market.
Britain’s doors will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for non-residents and companies with headquarters abroad to buy a home as it is for hard-working British nationals.
For many, the dream of their own home has become too distant, and the shame of homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My main goal is to coach Scotland’
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said it was his "biggest goal" to ever become Scotland's coach.
This 42-year-old Scotsman is now enjoying the challenge of revitalising the North-East club which now sits in third place in the First Division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League for the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got injured in the knee and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland in Hampden with my dad, as a child, and there’s always something that’s pulled me back.
But that would only be a chance if I do well to coach the squad.”
Ross's predecessors as coach of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach said he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of such a famous club, which he had previously rejected coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"As usual, I'm going to measure my success by thinking, 'Can I bring this club back into the Premier League?'
“This club definitely has a home in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities,” he said.
“It’s not an easy job to get him there, but I would probably only see myself as successful here if I get the club back up there.”
Ross has just three years of experience as a coach, following a spell as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coaching team for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from dropping out of the third division, and converted St Mirren, who was about to drop out of the division, into the league champions for the following season.
Ross says he is more confident now than he was ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real turning point,” he says of the period when he became coach of Alloa.
“I really believed that the coaching job suited me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, I had a decent income from it, and I had a decent success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I’m still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from the job, but the coaching job just seems right for me.

The best time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a poll
The heatwave this summer has proved to be profitable for British bars that are in spades, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, while sales in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and the unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to June, when bar sales rose by 2.8 percent, except for what restaurants sold even less.
Sales fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Pubs and bars, which are primarily aimed at drink sales, fared best with more boom while restaurants went downhill.
People who sell food also have a hard time in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out drinking.
Drink sales in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM, said: “These results are a continuation of the volatility we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the effects of important social events or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales in out-of-home markets.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups are still in trouble, even though a 4.8 percent drop in sales between months is particularly painful on top of continued pressure from costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for eateries, and only time will tell whether temperate temperatures, as we’ve had in August, will improve the situation.”
Total growth in sales at pubs and restaurants, including at newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the regulator with sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry benchmark for the sector.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, as young as 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to survey results.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in “artificial Insta” sites
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students say they have a “primary” account they show to parents
One in five children, as young as 11 years old, create secret accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
An opinion poll of 20,000 students showed a huge increase in “artificial Insta” accounts – which is a reference to the website Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “primary” account to show their parents, as well as secret accounts.
One mother, who stumbled onto her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC, found that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create an area online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘the voice of athletes’ on Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual General Assembly of the Board.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete and Ian Beattie, chair of the committee, said the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and international sports communities, and we are confident that Scotland’s sport sector would benefit greatly from her membership,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very interested to speak on behalf of the athletes and hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport forward in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, but has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was paralyzed after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I recovered and to what extent.
It has been hard work but I recovered fully, learned to walk again and do sports exercises today!
Thank you for your encouragement!”
Breast pump advertising, which compares mothers to cows, causes online disputes
A company that manufactures breast pumps is now being talked about online because of an advertisement that bears lactating mothers with cows that are milked.
The company Elvie published a bold advertisement to mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that can be worn on its own”. The advertisement is inspired by music videos and is intended to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay, and we sing a song with lyrics such as, “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see any tail on me” and “If you didn’t notice, these aren’t yuppies, they’re my breasts.”
“Pump, pump, I feed the kids, pump, pump, I pump the milk from the jowls.”
However, the ad, which appeared on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a stir online.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has received varying responses from viewers, many of whom say it mocks the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“Really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be full and bear to produce milk, unless the calves are taken from them just a few days after they are born.”

Another observer wrote: “Clearly difficult for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are allowed to hold their babies?”
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of step with the times.”
Others came to the defense, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "funny."
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I took it as it is.
“It’s great,” one of the viewers wrote.
Another said, “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows.’
It’s not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the advertisement, the women’s group shows that they have all been dancing with their breast pumps hidden in their chests.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is that many women say they feel like cows when they express milk.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or cords, and fits comfortably on top of a bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold onto their baby, and even go outside while pumping.
Mother’s co-owner and executive Ana Balarin said: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a prominent presentation that would attract attention.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumping and all its challenges, and show in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This is not the first time that Elvie the Pumpkin has made the news.
On the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared at a fashion show for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Moved Silently to Camp on Texas Border
The number of immigrant children in detention has increased abruptly even though the number of those crossing the border every month has remained roughly the same. Part of the reason is that the harsh rhetoric and policies put forward by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to bring the children into temporary foster care.
Usually, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have feared putting their chances of remaining in the country at risk, by offering themselves to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults within the household would have to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Matthew Albence testified before the Senate, saying his agency had arrested a number of people who were seeking to foster single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on the criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in foster homes are in the country illegally, and a large portion of them are illegal immigrants on criminal records.
“So we continue to look for those individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to work more quickly on the children’s cases, officials announced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous benchmark, according to staff working in the detention facilities.
Many of them will attend a video meeting, rather than in person, to argue their legal status before immigration judges.
Children who are deemed unfit to enter the country will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or refugee trials, according to shelter workers and reports published by the system in recent months.
Proponents said these problems were even more likely in a larger institution such as in Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that a child is having a hard time, because of the number of them.
They added that moving the children to the camp without enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say good-bye to friends could add to the trauma that many of them already face.
Syria Says U.S., French, and Turkish ‘Prisoners’ to Retire Instantly
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also said in his speech to the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false assumption that they were fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told parliament.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred struggle until we cleanse all Syrian areas” of both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign entities.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
In terms of refugee issues, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western countries” to “spread out unwarranted fear” urging refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They’re making politics out of something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone at the last major stronghold of the resistance has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia, on the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda, and that they "would be eliminated."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to set up the first meetings with a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition, to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying its work should be limited to "transgressing the provisions of the current government," and warned of any inroads.
Reasons Why Trump Will Win Another Election Period
According to that reasoning, Mr. Trump would win the re-election in 2020, unless charges and scandals put an end to his presidency, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
It would be “the most dramatic end of a presidential career ever.”
As it turns out, the audience doesn’t feel tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s peak ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s episode, “The Rachel Maddow Show,” has topped the ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news evenings.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, executive director of the ABC drama “Designated Survivor” about a government official who becomes president after the House of Representatives is devastated in an attack.
Nell Scovell, author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different hypothesis.
She remembers a taxi ride to Boston for the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Miss Scovell said to me.
There is entertainment in the mess.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether families of immigrants can unite and the health of the global economy.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than being an informed citizen when you look at the sixth-century panel of experts arguing the use of Bob Woodwards on “extremely intimate” sources for his book “Fear,” or the $15,000 jacket from an ostrich that Paul Manafort wore (“garment that’s fed with arrogance,” said the Washington Post) and the consequences of the accurate Daniel biopic.
I will never look at Super Mario again.
“Part of what he does to you feels like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the show “Pawn Stars,” said as he discussed the staff turnover in Trump’s show and the daily changes in the storyline (e.g., starting a fight with N.F.Un.L. and Pride).

When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss, it was 26 degrees and sunny outside of his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed indoors and watched MSNB while recording CNN.
He could not break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were making all these crazy episodes in the old days and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right.”

Money on the outside flows in the narrowest midterm elections
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district sees the money flowing in, thanks to the reorganization of its constituencies that led to two delegates competing for the same seat.
The newly restructured Pittsburg area sends Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in a special election last summer.
Lamb is standing up to another representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now the representative of the old 12th constituency in Pennsylvania, which overlaps sharply with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were restructured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old polls were organized in favor of Republicans and that they violated the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th constituency has been the start of a race for election campaign funding between the major funders of both parties, the Democratic National Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a special election in March for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania, many of whom watched those elections.
The Republicans had previously warmed that seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the polls by a 20-point margin.
Politicians have given Democrats a bit of a head start.
The U.S. was considering punishing El Salvador for backing China, but then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with small objections from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the owners drove the Trump group’s management team away.
Representatives of the State Department decided to recall the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "a recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokeswoman in a statement early this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief efforts in 2017, including for drug control, development efforts, and economic support.
The proposed punishments, which included a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the issuing of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where unemployment is high and murder rates are high.
As internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic success and were to follow a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, ending all speculation about punishments against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is to address the conference, due to take place in mid-October, as a sign of how important it is in the eyes of the government, the envoys said.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss in detail the discussions the three U.S. representatives described, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the insider talks against being allowed to remain anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the board and also spoke about the case against anonymity.
Learn the story
The next scandal could be Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor,’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, for which there is a variety of public evidence.
Mr. Mueller is also said to be turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress is to be run by another party, Trump may have to be held accountable as he prepares to meet with his constituents again, and perhaps a jury of his peers.
This is, however, very uncertain and I do not want to imply that Trump’s fall is unequivocal, nor is the fall of his colleague in Europe.
We all need to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the battle will be.
By 1938, German officials were ready to rob Hitler of power, only if Western countries had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of disaster that followed.
The story revolves around such important points and speeds up or delays the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing a number of such challenges right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump impeaches Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad place since this paper reported that last year he had suggested making secret tapes of the president, discussing whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is not correct.
“How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?”
And above all, will we vote for a midterm Congress that will make Mr. Trump take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who used to sit in my ambassador’s residence.
She survived, moved to the United States and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not have a positive outlook on our future?”

Graham Dorrans, Rangers team mate, optimistic for the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers face off against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to make it out of Group G of the European League. Rangers made an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
Injuries to his knee prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game earlier in the season against Villareal, which ended in a 2–2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use those results as a springboard for better results.
“It was good to get this point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” said Dorrans, 31.
“We started the game with the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Maybe we could have squeezed out a win in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
“They were probably better in the first half and we came stronger in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the club.
Hopefully we can reach three points but it will be a difficult game because they went well in their last game. But with the spectators supporting us I am sure we will persevere and get positive results.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that took place in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling on the spot.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the last season behind us and get results.”
Women Lose Sleep Due to Fear of Losing Retirement Savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of it, but they’re not taking the right steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t make your wishes clear to them in good time.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you get care, because these options can change a lot in terms of cost.
Get your financial advisor involved: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay expenses, or self-insured with your own money – as long as you own it.
Prepare all legal documents: Avoid legal disputes in advance.
Get a Health Care Accountant so you can nominate someone you trust to manage your health care and make sure healthcare professionals comply with your wishes if you can’t tell them directly yourself.
Consider also getting a procurator for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your accounts are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Please include this information in your written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about the money, it’s also about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
“Have a plan ready.”
Man shot multiple times with air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun as he was walking home after being out having fun.
The victim, a 50-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m., as a "random attack."
The victim did not see his assailant.
The man was not injured and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of dead expected to rise.
Since all communication is down, aid workers have not been able to provide any information from Donggala County, which is an area north of Palu and lies near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 at Richter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a county covering more than 380 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is a control area under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, most of them in Morowali, which is on the coast in front of Sulawesi.
Floods have struck Palu and Donggala several times in the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a tsunami struck and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
There was also a tsunami in the western part of Donggala in 1996, in which nine people died.
Indonesia sits on the active Pacific Ring of Fire, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis last year:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province in northern Sumatra struck on December 26, triggering a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on Richter struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck the city of Padang, the capital of Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on Richter struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, raising up to 10-metre high tsunamis that destroyed a number of villages, killing around 300 people.
2016: A major earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya district of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no flood this time, but more than 100 people lost their lives when buildings collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes ride over the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, a former governor of Alaska and presidential candidate, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for trying to block a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police released on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su Station, where he is expected to be heard in court, and is being held on $500 bail, according to a KTUU report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring that he was "not guilty, certainly" when he was asked to declare guilt or innocence, according to the news outlet.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and face a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B crime, which is punishable by a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been indicted.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the attack.
The case is currently in the state of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for obstructing a report of domestic violence and for carrying a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of surrendering soldiers in 2016 after she blamed PTSD on her son’s violent behavior, following his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are down and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck in the middle of Sulawesi Island, north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident happened are now on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attacker in New York City
Prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having participated in a terrorist attack in New York City that left eight people dead. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violations of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have taken a rented Home Depot truck to attack people on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He drove there down walking and cycling passers-by in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the victims eight times “intentionally” and inflicted serious bodily harm “intentionally,” according to the will to impose the death penalty, which was registered in the Southern District Court in New York.
Both of these charges could lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Many weeks after the attack, the federal court indicted Saipov in 22 counts, including eight charges of murder for criminal purposes, which are usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized crime organizations. Also, Saipov was charged with violent crimes and for destroying a car.
The attack included “a considerable amount of planned planning,” prosecutors said, describing Sapiov’s actions as “horrible, cruel, and immoral.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov suffered bodily injuries, injuries and losses for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is a decade since New York City’s southern region last took a death penalty case for treatment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a New York court case in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married couples who had been convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both euthanized in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he got the idea for the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said they were “of course disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the shock of this incident for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead negotiations on Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “activate the people’s army” today at a Tory conference.
This former leader of the UKIP said that politicians must “feel pressure” from EU skeptics, at the same time as one of the MPs Theresa May suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham rally that Britain “would be out” now if Mr Farage were the leader of Brexit.
But the challenge May faces to reconcile deep differences between her own team members was even more clear as Conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, joined other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track and is facing criticism from those who support Brexit, those who oppose it, and the EU.
The allies claimed that she will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition – forcing those opposed to Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and “unrest”.
Mr Bone told Leave Means Leave at Solihull that he wanted to "undo the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to participate and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out now,” he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.”
He explained his opposition to the EU, saying: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone refuted evidence that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: “The idea that the British public has changed their mind and wants to stay is totally untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a staunch supporter of Brexit, was also at the rally, telling reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular among the public and the opposition will not vote with it. It enjoys unpopularity among our party members and activists who are out on the streets voting for us.
Please, stop the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a direct message to May, she added, “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said that the politicians would have to “feel pressure” if they were to evade the decision taken following the 2016 vote.
“This is now about trust between us – the people – and our political party,” he said.
“They want to try to betray Brexit and we are here today to say to them, ‘We are not going to let you get away with this.'”
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to put pressure on your political party, which is betraying Brexit.
We are mobilising the public army in this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.”
At the same time, supporters of the EU held a protest march in Birmingham that ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved Conservative flags against Brexit after the group was set up over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, made fun of Conservatives for security concerns raised in the party’s phone app when the conference opened.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can have all the computer systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for border without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
“This is a total scandal.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren is seriously considering running for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she intends to "consider a serious run for the presidency" after the November election.
A Boston Globe report said the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has infrequently criticized US President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke this afternoon was her 36th meeting in the form of a citizens’ meeting with the residents of her constituency, since Trump took office.
One person in the audience asked her if she would like to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington and run our government, and then they also need a woman to lead.”
Arrest after deadly shooting at Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said she had arrested one of the suspects in LSU basketball player Wayde Sims' case, who was shot dead Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a person who was seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of it,” Murphy J. Paul, a police commissioner, told the media on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde came to his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been on the scene, with weapons in his possession, and confessed to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, where he played 32 games, including 10 in the starting team in the last season, playing an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points, and achieving 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat by order of their teams.
It was evident from the fact that Valtteri Bottas took a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before the start on Saturday, that orders from Mercedes would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start, almost leaving Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel went first into the pits and let Hamilton drive into the round at the end of the group, but that should have been the deciding factor.
The Mercedes went into the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged after a close fight where Ferrari's driver was forced to give up the inside after risking being left behind, after defensive attempts in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started late in the group and finished seventh at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he postponed changing tires to try to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen to reach fourth place.
He eventually went into the pit in lap 44 but was unable to increase the speed of the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri stood up all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me go.
The team has done a great job in achieving this result,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
U.S. President Donald Trump made fun of U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for her claims that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly discuss Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "evil and cruel and untruthful."
“The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that’s been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people that are angry and bad and cruel and untruthful,” he said.
“When you see the impressions and the leaks and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do this?
Do you remember her response... did you release the document – “Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I won't lie to you."
Now, wait a minute.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,” he said, mimicking the Senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, citing allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and was leaked in early September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t lie to her,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I did what she asked.”
But her denial didn’t seem to go over well with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday, “I’ll tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t like it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexually harassing three women, and suggested Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations.
“They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods are used.
You see the cruelty, the badness, no matter who they hurt, who they need to control to gain power and control,” the president said, according to a news report from Mediaite.
Premier League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for their loss on Friday in the Elite League league against the Belfast Giants, by beating the next game to follow, 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early two-goal lead after goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home side, but Dwyer brought the Giants back over.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then secured their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe of the Elite League, who had won Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal on the fourth minute, showing a time of 3:35, after a assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford then came with a assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
There was a lot going on in the first few minutes, and Sullivan brought the locals back into the game at 1:10 p.m., and Cownie recovered from Matt Marquardt's assist at 15 minutes.
Dwyer made sure to get the Giants over before halftime when he scored his second goal of the game at the end of the first quarter.
The home team pulled together and Bouchard levelled again for a goal when they were one man over in the 27th minute of the second quarter.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together and helped Nielsen bring Dundee over for the first time in the game late in the second quarter and he secured his team victory with the fifth goal after half of the last game third had passed.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will take on Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Killed to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers on Plane Escape Earthquake
Indonesia’s air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he was killed by a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Large aftershocks continue to afflict the area, and many are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his colleagues had fled the control tower that swung violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was detained to ensure that Batik Air flight number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake hit, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to a report from ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very saddened to hear this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could exceed 1,000, as the country’s disaster relief agency says access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"It is believed that the number of dead is still increasing because many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six meters high waves have caused massive destruction in Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft are working to bring supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with a body.
There is very little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is competing to find survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military, “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline, which had a plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, said one person was missing after all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of the afternoon of Saturday, it did not know about the fate of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about the details of the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that the condition of all of them was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon just ahead of the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the approach of the plane had been very low.
“It was really good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could wade the waist-deep water and find emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants had been frightened and shouting and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working close to repairing a dock also helped with the rescue by using an inflated boat to ferry people ashore, before the plane sank in about 30 feet of water.
Data from the Agency shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered aircraft accidents over the last two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening in which a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in a retrial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent many hours in court as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone files to piece together the journeys of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When documents revealed that his mobile phone was at Chambers' home at the same time he said he had been with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to speak with him.
Sanford testified Saturday that he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was "a lie, because my car was in Nashville."
Tellis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers’ death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact information from her phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
Officials are expected to deliver their final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be referred to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to combat negative opinion towards the music genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has distanced itself from its origins as it contained political messages and dealt with social issues.
They want to seek their origins again and make the conscious hipp bounce popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent boom in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York Foster Sues Couple for Dismissal After ‘Prejudiced’ Text Message
A New York City nurse is suing a married couple for illegal eviction after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies being prejudiced and likens the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out her new foster mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at work for the first time in 2016.
“NEEEEEIIIII OTHER BLACK HUMAN,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistake, "shameful" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their black ex-nurse had done poorly, and that she had expected to marry a Filipino woman, according to a report from the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice is now suing the couple and wants to receive compensation for the dismissal, in the amount of $350 a day for the six-month job she had been initially hired for, even though no contract had been signed.
“I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have protested the accusations of being prejudiced, saying that firing Maurice was the right thing to do because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message that she wasn’t going to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We’re not prejudiced people,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But who would trust their children with anyone after showing that person rudeness, even if it was a surprise?
Their newborn baby?
Come on, come on.
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “extortion,” saying his wife was seven months pregnant and in “a very difficult situation.”
Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It’s not very nicely done,” said Plasco, who works in the investment sector.
The case is still on trial, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple on social media and shamed it for its behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to follow in the footsteps of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
“It’s very funny now that we know of Paddington’s enormous success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a little toy bear, had taken rejection of his work with calm positivity, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet" after his death last year.
In the case of Paddington, whom she describes as "an extremely important member of the family," she added that her father had quietly taken pride in his success in the end.
“He was a very quiet man and not used to bragging,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like you have a child who does something. You’re proud of it even if you haven’t done anything yourself.
I think he had something to do with Paddington’s success.
Although Paddington was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but to no avail.
“Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, ‘Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart beating were gradually losing their function and being eliminated from the body.
She had just died, and her body was giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all going to happen.
I couldn’t stand or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to be in control.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the hardships she was experiencing.
“Nobody knew anything,” she said.
“I was crying and tears were falling all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Angry women hang up message to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, the son of Miss Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney and said her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room.”
He stopped working before he died, because he was “sucked down into a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11-year-old, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that there will be repercussions from it.”
Ms. Davis created the message “to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don’t sit around and say nothing – you need to talk to someone.”
Miss Humphreys, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was sick or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a great shock to them, but that they had to work it out: “This is tearing a hole in the family.
It will tear us apart.
We have to keep fighting and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
“I thought if we could get something like what he asked for – a study with limited time and scope – we might get a little bit of a consensus,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “dividing up” in the middle of a dispute between the parties as everything was backlocked.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their slowness is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6. If Republicans are doing poorly, as expected, it seriously weakens their efforts to get their man elected to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met Ashley, his wife through him, who was Mr. Bush’s private secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its investigation report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still not certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break up the tie and confirm him in the office of Supreme Court Justice.
Number of North Koreans fleeing North Korea 'decrease' under Kim
The number of people fleeing North Korea and moving to South Korea has dwindled since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean parliamentarian.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Council, said that 1,127 people had fled last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher fees charged by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross them than the well-cared-for neutral area between North and South Korea.
China views the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions that focused mainly on delayed negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work roughly together towards a nuclear-free Korea.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed U.S. trade officials for a lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally dismantle our nuclear weapons first,” Ri said in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "maternal illness" and says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "maternally ill" and said he was too temperamental to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called mother-sick,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost shouting and getting a lump in his throat as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also publicly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “disgusting and orchestrated homicide” orchestrated by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
“I think these allegations and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats show that he is unfit for the job,” she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to have Kavanaugh fired if he is confirmed and if Democrats win a majority in Congress.
“If he’s not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only unfit to stand in the Supreme Court, but he’s in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, where he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh shrugged off questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is no time for a mother-sick, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say, ‘How wonderful that is,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to take advantage of it.
It’s a righteous discourse, months and years of rage flow out of it, and it doesn’t come out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s uncommon, but you?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed technology so that when she got angry and started crying, she said to her interviewee, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from my previous job that I held in an office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out of rage that I could not express, an older woman came and grabbed my buttocks. She was a cold-hearted boss that I had always feared a little bit and she dragged me into the stairwell.
“Don’t ever cry,” she said.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they're glad you've caught up with you."
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign, when she was a Democrat from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught cheating on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, Miss Schroeder, indignant, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a good decision,” she said, laughing at me, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had come a long way, she was behind on fundraising, so she vowed not to run unless she could raise $2 million.
A battle was lost.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she wondered.
When she delivered her speech, announcing that she would not formally present herself, she was so overcome by feelings—grateful for the people who had supported her, annoyance at the system, which made it so difficult to raise funds and turn her eyes to voters instead of representatives, and anger at the gender gap—that she burst into tears.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder said as she recalled how the media reacted.
“You would think that Kleenex would be my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
Why a trade war between the US and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots of the U.S.-China trade war were infuriating, and while the war is far from over, a split between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing a tax on China’s main exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new tariffs covering goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), and taxing nearly half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same currency each time, recently imposing 5 to 10 percent tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to the US tariffs, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will soon succumb.
To get Washington to back down, demands must be made, but it would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, President of China, to publicly bow down to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing holds its own, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive impact on China in the long run, reducing the mutual need of both economies for each other.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation leading to an economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than the audience has previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return to the country and is seeking help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad state after a seven-year war.
Foreign Minister Walid al Moualem, speaking at the UN General Assembly, said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore normal conditions by building up areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
All is now ready for refugees to return willingly to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic decisions that targeted their daily lives and jobs.
More than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the United States with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 points at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European grounds and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, achieved the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled the most during the entire race, made his debut into the water on the 16th hole, a par 3, losing his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all of his matches, becoming 1 of 4 players to get a 5-0-0 score, since the competition started using its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, but he was in the bottom position in the ranking of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is in the top spot on the list of the world's best golfers, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who played possibly in his last Ryder Cup competition.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times for the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
This has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team, and it was my pleasure to be able to help," Garcia said after the European win.
He handed his country the John Rahm torch, defeating US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a solo match on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now listed as 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange result for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only in second place behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find themselves on the pitch, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said of his team’s performance, “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was in the early hours of the morning that we pushed Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take over for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We’ll get back together, I’ll be working with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup and we’ll keep going.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their captain.
You have to take it from above.
They played better than us.”
