Welsh MPs don’t want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today by the abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title could be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from across the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour representative explained his group was concerned because “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "dusty", and pwp means "poop".
A representative for the Wales party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was “disgruntled” and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of the MWP is very close to the word "Muppet", which, in addition to being the name of some well-known dolls, is also a British slang word for "dust".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way to the letter U in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: “It is, of course, the members themselves who have the final say as to which name they should be referred by.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public hearing that showed public support for renaming the National Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the representatives, the Commission supported Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
Representatives are reportedly proposing other options, but getting all parties to an agreement could cause headaches for Parliament President Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a legislative draft for the name change over the next couple of weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the final say on what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide if the country’s name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour’s name constitutes a claim to its territory, and has on several occasions opposed the country’s applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The Bells of St. Martin's are Stilling - The Nooks of Harlem Are Struggling
“The elders I spoke to told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
“Now there are none of those things.”
He said the bar dropout was understandable.
“People socialize with each other in other ways” these days, he says.
“Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling possessions will not last as long as the leaders believe. “And sooner or later they are back at the starting point.”
The churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only hasten the day when these churches will have to close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin’s got a black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street—one of Harlem’s main trades—because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for its reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was "the church bells of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin’s over the past few months is a complex interaction between architects and contractors, some of whom are hired by the church’s lay leadership and others by the diocese.
The Council of Churches, the lay leadership of the church, wrote to the diocese in July about its concern that the diocese would “attempt to impose costs” on the Council of Churches, despite the fact that the Council of Churches had not been involved in the commissioning of the architects or contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of openness on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old in California lobster dive
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he ducked for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought the boy was shouting with excitement at catching a lobster, but he eventually realized the boy was shouting, "I got bitten!
I was bitten!”
His whole collarbone was torn up,” said Hammel, who discovered the injury when he reached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered severe upper torso injuries.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its mark on the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like make-up and beauty-care shelves, staffed by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a strong entry into the UK’s 2.8 million beauty market, which is experiencing steady growth while sales of clothing and home items are falling. If the trial proves successful, the concept will be expanded to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket’s efforts to find a new use for the space previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s has said it will double the number of beauty products it offers to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store has never sold before.
Existing product lines from L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees will also have more space in branded areas, just like in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique make-up brand with mainly vegan products, because there is an increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will be testing out retail tables in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon in south London last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, has said that the stores will look more and more like a department store, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods outside of food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to upgrade its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was discontinued after a dispute over the distribution of income from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 retail pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyd’s Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Director of Commerce, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to create a more welcoming environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will then be ready to provide advice and help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the inviting surroundings and convenient locations make us a beauty competitor that represents a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones is 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is reportedly furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for your home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop.
This Morning host Willoughby announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragons Den star Peter Jones by retiring from their profitable lifestyle brand at the last second to focus on her own new gold-edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “outraged” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the television gold girl admitted that her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – mean she no longer has time to spare for their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected it would double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
At the same time that Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was leaving the UK on her way to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s number one priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security for the next few decades.
Everyone is shocked that she decided to leave.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was right before the launch.
Now a warehouse full of goods stands at the headquarters in Marlow that is now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that This Morning host, who is among the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the company several million pounds due to heavy investment in products such as cushions and lights, fashion and cuddly clothes, as well as a potential delay in its launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones holds a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We will not comment on his business dealings.”
“Facts and then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment some would consider “little presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I haven’t given anything away.”
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big dirt on the road to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
Talks on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “similar response” from the US to its early disarmament efforts.
He noted that the United States, instead, still has sanctions aimed at keeping up the pressure.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke before an assembly of his constituents.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, such as putting an end to missile tests, helping to free hostages and getting the remains of U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential worthiness, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this stuffy arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami Destroy an Island, Killing Hundreds
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign nonprofit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok residents had lost their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging,” Sumbung explained.
Save the Children is now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Crisis Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Considering the constant earthquakes to which Indonesia is exposed, it is terribly ill-prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Shelters to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although a warning had been issued, has probably contributed to the death toll.
Even in the best of circumstances, travelling between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade to Indonesia’s dilapidated infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has been a major problem for Joko’s administration, which is due for re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have switched to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late equaliser in match against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left foot before sending it to the far corner.
The attempt flew high above the box as the ball dropped towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally rushed over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq are always putting the ball forward as best they can, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge said.
“I saw Kante come and touch the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it further.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker sent a heeled pass back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half of the field.
Kovacic made a quick handover in midfield.
He then fired a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the far corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the European Football League (EFL) in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia reaches 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's crisis management agency announced early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5-gauge hitting the country on Friday and causing waves of up to six meters, the agency's spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from demolished buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man has been arrested, suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would ask anyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
“We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to get in touch – they may have information that is critical to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the deceased woman was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are told it will be several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene of the crime.
She says, “It’s so awful” over and over again.
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were behind the roadblock, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the roadblock and supervised the apartment complex.
People who have information are asked to send an instant message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, by referring to “log 247” from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial dragged into the dispute over "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would have been poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publishing house as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Palace of Westminster would also be a target.
The English Civil War iconoclasm was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s fantastical portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the opinions of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a man many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as Parliament’s defender against outside pressure – in his day, of course, there was talk of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Killing pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, whose last name is “Yuan,” was found dead and covered in blood from a ruptured artery near a binge at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that inside the pigsty there was a big boar with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg pig had killed the man.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mauled,” explained the cousin, mentioned by the surname Wu, in a quote to the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
As police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating for compensation for the death.
Although it is rare, it is not the first time that a pig has attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg pig until the farmer’s wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive at all, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
“They’re just playing.
They like to nibble, and are very curious... they try not to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.”
Remains of Hurricane Rosa Will Cause Heavy Rain in Southwest U.S.
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves across the cooler ocean on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will still bring flooding rains on her journey through northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind speed of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. ET on Sunday, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin pushing tropical moisture northward toward the southwest United States, and the Pacific Ocean will be the first of its kind in the world.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical humidity and the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, floating debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates of up to 5–7 cm per hour in some areas, particularly areas in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially across much of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rains.
It is very unwise to move around the desert on foot as long as there is a risk of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause river valleys to turn into banks of rushing rivers, and thunder will cause local gusts of wind that may contain dust and sand.
The approaching trough will cause local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along Southern California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to floating debris and fast, as well as slippery road surfaces.
This will be the area's first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and persist throughout Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics remain very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of severe temperature differences throughout the central United States on Sunday.
There will be nearly an 11-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States will likely get off to a warm start in October, with highs in the twenties from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City could reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this would be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate message indicates that the Eastern United States will most likely have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers across six television networks watched Thursday’s poignant testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday’s big surprise at the last second, when it emerged that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take her clothes off at a middle school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he’s 100 percent sure this didn’t happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The ratings were not immediately available to other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has trouble measuring office viewers.
To give some perspective, these are ratings equivalent to the playoffs of the American Football Championships or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have enthusiastically supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led the networks, with average ratings of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake was the main character for Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office made a statement that he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor. On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a court committee meeting as protesters screamed and shouted at him.
He stood with lowered eyes for several minutes while he was scolded, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told that “you have the power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office has issued a statement, and said as the elevator doors closed that he would have more say on the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered the hearing live several hours later, as the court committee was due to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be passed to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he was willing to do so only if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate within next week, which the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after speaking with Coons and then several other senators.
Flake’s election had a big impact, as it was clear that Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
Theresa May accuses critics of ‘political game’ over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU of playing “political games” with Britain’s future and undermining the nation’s interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called “Chequers” plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to overtake each other’s tariffs was “absolutely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday detailing the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the head and through the throat.
Police thank the Louisiana State Police's Refugee Retention Task Force, the state's police laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and local residents for their contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police force for its “hard work and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2m tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "broken" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
“This is what we fear at all times,” Wade said.
Volcanoes spewing ash over Mexico City
The ash spewing out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevenci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Desastres, Mexico’s government agency for crisis prevention, warned Mexico’s people on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after activity soared in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over the course of 24 hours.
The agency monitored several cases of rumbling and shaking.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is located 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police, while thousands took part in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked separatists were detained by riot police, and bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark clouds of dust in streets usually full of tourists.
Fighting also broke out later in the day, as police used batons to limit fights.
For hours, independence protesters chanted “Never forget, never forgive,” face to face with unionist protesters chanting “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions are still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming majority for secession, but it was a poor turnout because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed liberation.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets overnight to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was halted anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia’s possibility of becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had trouble keeping up the pressure this year, as many of their bitterly-familiar leaders have gone into self-imposed exile or are in detention while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used her phone to film the protest to support police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he will stand for election in the European Parliament next year.
“Standing up for election as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was rammed into the wall of a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was driven into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30pm BST.
Police Superintendent Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston
Livinston surprised Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga proved crucial, and Gary Holt’s side is now tied with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s side have yet to win away in the Premier League this season and will play Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
The Rangers will play their home game against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, has remained undefeated through six games in the division, with Holt having not lost a game since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against its sluggish guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only pass the kick on after sliding in to face Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for their guests at set-pieces.
And that’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to clear Menga’s ground, and he scored a goal from in the middle of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers had had the ball pretty much all the time, but the home team's defense had proven to be impregnable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a close-scoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston deathball in a wide short pass.
Cruisers kept getting into the Livingston box and were constantly rescued, while two penalty claims – once after Halkett’s protest against substitute Glenn Middleton, and once on hand – were overlooked.
“Phenomenal” from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and continue to exceed all expectations on their way up.
The style of play and crew have barely changed since they made it back to the top, but Holt is credited with the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated an enormously well-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
The Rangers didn’t have my inspiration.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was lackluster – they only made it into the home half once – and that was quite a wake-up call for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets a mixed reception in Cologne
All was just smiles and blue skies on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the NATO allies.
Disputes have arisen over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security as the reason a crowd of 25,000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters turned up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also came forward, criticizing both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the dissension that follows a man hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford crash: Cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist has been killed in a collision as with a passenger car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
The crash takes place just one month after a cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident in which the driver escaped from the Children’s Street crime scene, about a mile from Saturday’s collision.
The Metropolitan Police said police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus detours are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in riots
Six officers were injured in an incident at a high-security men's prison, according to prison officials.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialized Tornado officers have been brought in to handle the incident, which involves eight inmates and is confined to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: “Specialised prison staff have been sent in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police and may have to spend even more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was receiving hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot police were called in to deal with a serious incident in which the employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial for drought areas)
Arizona is rarely hit by a tropical depression, but that’s likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining power travels through the deserts of the southwest, bringing flooding risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low-pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some locations in the Mongollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas within the desert to the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of flood danger, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the southwestern United States is currently in a state of drought.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, which is the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land at the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km, is located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, thereby losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and cause great flooding.
“Total rainfall of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with potential for up to 25 cm of precipitation,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, as it moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The main hazard expected of Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert of the United States,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening flooding and liquid debris and rapid in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incident to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered from the pettiness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reckless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered from the pettiness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously denying the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his allegations during the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people saw how brilliant, how capable and how brave” Kavanaugh was that day.
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, with impeccable record in public service,” he told an audience of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president discreetly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the midterms.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I’m not really a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats aim to “resist and prevent.”
The Senate’s first intermediate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to an assistant to a Republican party leader.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunami, numbers expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to sea by huge waves pounding the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves pounded ashore around sunset, destroying everything in their path and dragging many into drowning death.
The tsunami came on the heels of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami danger arose yesterday, people were still engaging in activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNBP, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami was not alone – it was carrying cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at 500 miles per hour before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.”
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the crisis management agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and shattered bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Bureau of Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the power of Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater land coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area named Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely crippled, completely without information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building shouts desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passers-by on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water thunders towards the beach, tearing away buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has hindered communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other necessities.
The city's airport is only open for relief work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's just awful.
World Vision staff from Donggala have made it safely to Palu city centre, where they have taken shelter under tarpaulin tents in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed major devastation along the way, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's just awful.
As aid agencies began their bleak preparations to deliver emergency aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were being refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released to a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open the borders for international help, but the situation has not been given any status yet.”
As the sun sets over Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that brighten up the grim news picture after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was freed by rescuers after spending two days trapped under rubble with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandino, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those trapped in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional load to carry,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to practitioners attending the Palu Beach Festival.
But the messages only led to gray tick marks, rather than a couple of blue tick marks.
“I think it means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal US$26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole US$26,750 from a Brink's worker who filled an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and was getting ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "ran up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a money bag to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects escape from the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity must contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, “The creature formerly known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she canceled on "emotional grounds," according to the series creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that’s us.
It went from being Kanye, meaning the one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he “will never ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Military troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Financial Aid for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, an investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several U.S. government departments made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, for its part, adopted a plan last year and aims to be number one in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double spending on AI research would be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double financial support could double the chance that the next big achievement in artificial intelligence comes from the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the premier artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that beat America's best Othello player, and later was a director at Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation’s wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that’s stealing the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired smart minds from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I think that those who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should receive an offer of a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China’s Minister of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the US legislation aimed at creating a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been stopped for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia” to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that its northern neighbor’s name constitutes a claim on Greek territory, and has vetoed their inclusion in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic-majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Are you for NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be decisive, because a large enough number of MEPs have said that they will abide by the result of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission has said they had not received any irregularity reports by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko are voting in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country’s name to open its doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the vote.
“We are positive about NATO and the EU, but we want to be admitted with our heads up, not let in through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they won’t accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said a “yes” answer would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll released last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of eligible voters will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of blacks plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero manoeuvres past Brighton's entire defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smashed the Brighton defence in Manchester City’s 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He raced with three Brighton defenders before getting out on the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He made it around one defender before running from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
He then sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
He was lucky to score a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball placed inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful break-through pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before leading Sterling to the far corner.
The Sky Blues attacking player sent the ball into the net just before it was over the dead line.
City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer is a spoiler for the Rockies.
Nationals are no longer candidates for the playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
The ever-equally competitive Scherzer still hopes to be on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, which leads the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
Even if we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will be what is most likely to be the highest level of game I get to play this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to take Scherzer's pitch in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is the starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will pitch with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
The Trump National Assembly in West Virginia
The president discreetly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not a participant, but I’m a participant. That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates,” he said.
You see this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back at all costs, and that's where you see the meanness and the meanness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, aim to “resist and prevent.”
“And you see that over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and nasty and dishonest.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, after which the audience booed loudly.
“Do you remember her answer?”
Did you leak the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I’m expecting one – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to all.
They don’t tolerate people who speak their mind.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
I am, after all, the latest in a long line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My fellow parliamentarian Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was highly critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was to be censored because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of having responsible economic policies, regarding national security, regarding Europe – ironically similar to the issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood at many of the meetings, and the promise of “softer, friendlier” politics has long since been forgotten, if at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously thought I shared many political views with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, whether on national security or the EU’s single market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I say – I receive a wealth of nasty messages on social media calling for my removal, condemning centre-left politics and telling me I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And I’m not the only one who has experienced this.
I know I’m luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and goal-oriented these colleagues are when they encounter a sea of sexist and racist comments every day, but never allow themselves to be cowed.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to all, and every motion of no confidence and every amendment of the electoral rules makes the party narrower.
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better.”
But that’s not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had led to my classroom in the public school I attended being literally dilapidated, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could possibly have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the representative proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country rages our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot fathom and understand the desire to waste time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political intransigence will stop me from doing what I believe best serves your interests.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final score a bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only undefeated of the ten.
In the end, it was as much their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they were given that led the home side to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be pleased.
“We have been challenged in our matches so far and are still undefeated, so I must be happy with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “All credit to Ayr, they were better off using the opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt with Frazier Climo's goal kick gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to equalise the score, and Jason Baggot scored a goalless try.
Climo strengthened Ayr's lead with a penalty before, just before the break, scoring and scoring a solo attempt to change the score to 17–5 at the break.
However, Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a goal kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was followed by a lengthy hiatus in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried on a stretcher, and from the restart Ayr increased the lead even more with a try from Stafford McDowell, with a goal kick from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, then received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the pitch to the fullest with an attempt from Bruce Colvine without a goal kick, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Climo when he did not have the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown on the throw-in behind the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo scored a goal kick, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe overtook David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth try.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that Still Game star Ford Kieran is entering the hospitality industry – it was recently discovered that he is named as the director of a restaurant company with a liquor license.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, for which he writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
Duen has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series finale, and it appears that Kiernan is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "vibrant restaurant business".
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia, a country without coastline, hopes court will open way to Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The entire inland state of Bolivia still remembers the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s, and the country longs to once again be able to sail on the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps greater than they have been in decades, as Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the drive, community spirit and serenity, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens in many different places in the country, in the hope that the court in The Hague will give its ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after decades of sporadic negotiations – is obliged to negotiate about giving Bolivia its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who faces a controversial reelection campaign next year – has also staked heavily on Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly side with Bolivia, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The UN agency, which is based in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean lands, and has stipulated that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
The ruling by the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the latest arguments were heard, suggesting that the case “was not complicated,” according to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than having promoted Bolivia’s cause, the last four years may actually have made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She believes that Morales's antagonistic rhetoric has consumed any remaining goodwill on Chile's part.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court’s decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation’s relations with Chile” and the opportunity “to put an end to 139 years of disagreement, to the benefit of both parties.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales—still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents—has used the maritime situation as a political cover-up.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Knowledge is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it will not denuclearize unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never dismantle its nuclear weapons if it could not trust the U.S. government.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honour promises it made during a meeting between the two conflicting countries’ leaders in Singapore.
These comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems poised to launch the frozen nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a “wishful dream” that continued sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War would ever bring North Korea to its knees.
U.S. officials are skeptical of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an arsenal the country probably sees as the only security guarantee it has.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Shows in Paris Reveal the Latest in Huge Headwear Headlining Towards a Clothing Store Near You
If you want to have some great additions to your hat collection or hide completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of quirky, oversized headwear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed fashionistas at fashion week in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most remarkable garment was an exaggerated beige hat embellished with a feather-like wide brim that drowned the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-adorned watermelons, a wizard's hat, or even a pineapple, but they aren't made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn-on lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the final scream.
One creation was reminiscent of diving equipment, including snorkel and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you are looking for even more great fashion accessories, then you are in luck.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be heading towards a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right on the heels of “La Bomba”, the straw hat with a half-meter wide brim that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another great creation down the catwalk – a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model wearing it.
The orange raffia bag, lined with raffia fringes and complemented by a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has made such a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to display academic excellence, and this has persisted in 2018 with another year of outstanding exam results, underpinned by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, these schools have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, working hard to deliver the very best school experience to students and parents alike.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, words go to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, his words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we see that language is at the top of the table with the highest pass rates from independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages received the examination grade of A.
The data, obtained from the Council’s 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students received an A grade in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A grade.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people are undoubtedly going to need in the future.
Language as a choice of subject is now valued at the same level as science as science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the curriculum for independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of the reasons employers reported having difficulty filling a vacancy were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become essential in a globalized world.
If you’ve learned a second language, these lifelong skills will provide real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a double-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language learning is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teach in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most valuable to the UK on the road to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a choice of languages to choose from at independent schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish independent schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, whatever the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that languages are increasingly crucial to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Charter schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction to Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Chair of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is yet to be determined.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After a practice session earlier this week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career,” he replied.
Time of Trump's People's Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
The president is starting a series of electoral rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five scheduled public meetings over the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court nominee has been put on hold, Trump aims to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, since Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight, and how can it be viewed online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearings with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation vote has been put on hold for up to a week as the FBI investigates the case.
With the main goal of all these rallies being to support Republicans who are facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has said that these five rallies over the next few weeks are aimed at “inciting volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president wants to travel to as many states as possible as we move toward a busy campaign season,” a Trump spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh press,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time over the past month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday’s singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes may have been exactly what this year’s Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the Momentum is a completely fictional sports concept, but still something players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is?
“They led with six points and now there are four, so I guess we’re carrying that with us as a bit of momentum,” Spieth said.
Europe will of course have the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 to play for.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel that they have got some wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent game play from tee to green, leading by example.
The deep celebration screams grew louder as his round continued, sinking to a crucial putting to raise the match to a draw when he and Thomas were down two after two.
His putting, which won them the game at 15, was met with a similar outcry – of the sort that shows he still doesn’t think the American team is without a chance.
“We really just have to put all the cloths on and focus on our own match,” Spieth said.
That's all each of these players has now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly the Ryder Cup’s great success story.
Europe’s unusual but lovely couples have four out of four and don’t put a foot wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only pair to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday’s biggest competitors, and there are no other players the public would rather see ensure a European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in each hole.
It is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily teamed up with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was partnered with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spaniard and Swede were so far behind that they had no chance of catching up.
There is no help on Sunday.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to watch up close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can turn around in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is way ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the fighting spirit some, especially in the United States, have missed.
Europe leads 10-6 at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong head start at the start of the Ryder Cup’s final day, having completed Sunday’s four-ball and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
The brilliant duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins against a downed Tiger Woods, raising their Le Golf National score so far to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, fighting to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America’s ill-fated side in this morning’s fourballs and won the series 3–1.
The United States gave more opposition in foursomes and won two matches, but they didn’t catch up any of the lead.
Jim Furyk's side must collect eight points from Sunday's 12 singles game to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, and he and Molinari – nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only pair to score four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they worked together seamlessly to beat degraded Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who limped through two games on Saturday, flashed in between, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning’s fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in the foursomes and scored a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe didn’t get everything they wanted on this warm day with a light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fought 2&1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to recover from a four-point lead at the start of singles, but as current holders, Furyk's side only need to score a draw to retain the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it doesn’t look like they’ll be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea says it will “in no way” agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened mistrust of the United States and that the country would in no way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual general assembly that North Korea has taken “significant goodwill actions” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising not to disperse nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not seen a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri reiterated well-known North Korean grievances against Washington’s opposition to a gradual denuclearization, in which North Korea is rewarded for gradual denuclearization steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, in which Kim pledged to work toward “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first,’ raising the pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposing the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” according to Ri.
“The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream for people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party to this disarmament issue were South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as entrenched as it is.”
However, the tone of Rice’s speech was very different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland US with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood this year in front of the UN and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said that much work still remains to be done and the sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he didn’t have a timeframe for this, saying, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that, “Security Council sanctions must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and affirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to curb funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, saying he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying they had made progress, but only hours after North Korea accused him of making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile site as well as a nuclear weapons facility if the U.S. took “similar measures.”
He said Kim had said these “similar measures” he wants were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by tackling the growing culture of memorizing themselves through the night with caffeine drinks as fuel.
One academic found that students at the world’s best universities often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
“After the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why hasn’t anyone said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to the students the importance of good sleep habits in order to perform academically and athletically, and for the general condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the university’s health services, said the university decided to start the course after they saw students suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive assignments.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important a sleep routine is.
In another part, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this is not going to change student behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know about this, just as you have a right to know about the risks of smoking,” Professor Czeisler said.
There is still some pride in being able to memorize all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said—even as a remedy against weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, leading to constant hunger pangs.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, taking one of the professor’s classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master’s students to take a similar program of study before enrolling in the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm for when to go to bed as well as for when to get up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Goal by Menga knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another away loss when Dolly Menga's goal beat Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to get their first win since February's 4–1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left his side eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to equalize.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble brewing for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from the away crowd.
Gerrard made eight substitutions on the team, which swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased with how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the goalpost.
The Rangers took control, but it looked like their game leaned more on hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have had a penalty after 15 minutes, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson refused.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opening in the 34th minute may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn’t handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept a cool head when he selected Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent at half-time, and the change of player gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play just the kind of game they like, as Lithgow and Halkett caught the long ball after the long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last half, but McGregor stood up to Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim as he clashed with Jacobs, but again saw Thomson off.
The Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the “Sunday Morning” almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of popular culture via the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Let’s say it makes noise now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave his name to lives on.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Cancer Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and altering them in a laboratory
The cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, and then be injected into the patient again.
A vaccine under trial has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she was suffering from disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then injecting those cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of various cancers,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and “trained” to target cancer cells, has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came out vehemently defending Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a groping performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he lashed out at the Democrats, repeating that he supported Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person and they say, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee about allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the footage.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back room regarding the choice of headgear.
“They bullied me.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that hat on.”
They bullied me!
And then they said that I don’t understand what the reality is,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want me to see what the reality is?” he said, saying that he would “put on the Superman robe, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.”
His comments were booed at least twice, and the staff working at SNL looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one staff member saying, “The whole studio went dead silent.”
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many people when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR STANDING AGAINST THE MASS.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just “who he is and that’s amazing.”
But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his “art,” which I believe cultivates and spews ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
“So are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was “the entity formally known as Kanye West”.
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puffy Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, then of course there is the late music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who used to be known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington lashes out at "gifty masculinity"
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on film often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of “toxic masculinity” in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he was very concerned about the topic.
“It worries me pretty much at the moment – where did the masculinity go wrong?” he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly to blame for the increase in “toxic masculinity” due to its highly masculine roles.
He continued: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is conveyed on TV and on the street, what is it that makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate this very side of being a man?
I think that’s one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change that?
It’s clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is “finished with battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the shoot, so something good came out of it — my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, says health representative.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease infection is due to inadequate protection during sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of a response to the problem.
Maxine Waters denies co-worker leaked data on Republican senators, snorting “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
House Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that members of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on the lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured of the allegations was made by “ultra-conservative” commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies,” Waters said in a statement.
The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the abuse charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
“This unfounded allegation is completely false and an outright lie,” Waters said.
“The members of my staff — whose identities, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations — had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an outright lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They must not defend themselves.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too aggressive during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is working to remove Waters in the midterms, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “relevant authorities and police to these false allegations.”
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and held accountable for all actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit allusions in every new film with a British slant and it seems to be appropriate for this revival of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfaction about how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and rubber face has had his license renewed to mess it up for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English speaking cinema audiences.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean, and a portion of that guy who contributes a single note to the fire wagon-themed music segment at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-forgotten television ads for Barclaycard; the traveler and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There are a few great moments in the latest Johnny English journey.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades snuffed his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy comes into its own, but the humor feels rather anaemic and oddly superfluous, especially now that the “serious” brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are willingly outdoing comedy.
The humor seems to be more geared towards children than adults, and for me Johnny English’s blunders are not as inventive and pointed as the silent film loops in Mr Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identities of all the British agents in the field, to the dismay of the vigilante agent – a lamentably minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for a prime minister, a pompous and downcast figure who is already undergoing a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this pretend-Teresa-May role, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she must bring in some of the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobbish establishment, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence. There are some amusing sequences here, when English offers a rocking academy for spy activity.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick briefing and reunited with his old, tormented helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, spliced with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin style of messing everything up on a mission for the Queen is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko’s amazing femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cyber problems: the insidious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey with farcical escapades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant, wreaking havoc while hiding aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English unleashes sheer anarchy as he attempts to use a VR headset to make his mark in Volta’s house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even as amiable and noisy it is so there is a lot that reminds of children's TV with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies plans to let Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that will give the British a four-day work week – but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants business leaders to spend savings on the artificial intelligence revolution by giving workers an extra weekday off.
This will mean that the employees will receive a three-day weekend, while they will receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
Trade unions are supporting the transition to a four-day week so that workers too can enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to swing the pendulum to the workers’ advantage—in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day week is not party policy and is not something that is considered by the party.”
Fiscal spokesman for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless CEOs” and “profiteers” of public service providers.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not getting back their entire shareholding because a Labour government can make “deductions” out of perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and set up employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private sector companies to the employees, who could receive an annual dividend of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' about Kavanaugh FBI investigation could make them change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s findings might prompt some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to that than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, cocksure, unequivocal."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be set in stone.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it had to be a startling discovery,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett vigorously denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she mentioned couldn’t confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change that.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped fight poverty?
This Saturday, New York City is hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive roster of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission: eradicate world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will bring thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to experience the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event’s real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to fight poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless one is willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, taking a phone call, or in other meaningful ways raising awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – that people feel they contribute big by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from supporters, with a wealth of different goals.
They say these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had 390 engagements and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the UK that will “help children realise their full potential”, and pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as ‘blockade’ to hinder Russian energy exports
Washington can “if necessary” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially when operating at the invitation of the legitimate government — is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate on energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States, through the Navy, has the ability to make sure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block to make sure that the energy doesn’t reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that profiles itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, noting that they are largely similar.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as “one trick pony” with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a tour to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
Employees in the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project, the Northern European gas pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which is to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier,” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the US to stay out of the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have big problems with third countries meddling in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “think seriously” about her 2020 presidential run, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "think seriously" about running for president after the midterm elections.
During a voter rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she will run.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix the shaky government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will be seriously considering whether to run for president.”
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the rally, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried all the way to the margin about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before a vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should run in 2020.
58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported his candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% were against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names being discussed in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin’s PTSD during Trump’s vote
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after coming home, I have in common with other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers bring,” she told the audience at a campaign rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans: “They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home wondering if this is the respect of their soldier comrades and airmen and all other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence on a woman, tampering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman in Wasilla.
18 states and D.C. support testing of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented a briefing from the amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been made public.
She claimed that her partner “and his violent gang member sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a 2014 decision by the Court of Appeals for Immigrants that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “disregards many decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle,” said the briefing from the amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the briefing that the policy of denying immigrants access harms the U.S. economy, saying that there is a high probability that they will become entrepreneurs and “contribute with the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in the June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even serious ones – that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu – death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation worsened.
“It was very exciting,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforts her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the collapsed city of Palu.
“All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents could be seen coming to broken homes and searching through water-damaged belongings in an effort to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing heavy aftershocks.
He has tears in his eyes as he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to be safe.
I was pinched by the wall that collapsed, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of “harassment” with “propaganda ads”
A week after a Chinese public newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in a US newspaper beautifying the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the attachment China Daily paid to move into the Des Moines Register—the biggest-selling newspaper in Iowa—after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the US election marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, US officials said.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has resulted in rounds of new tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s punitive tariffs early in the trade war were supposed to hit export companies in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts report.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Sunday column in the Des Moines Register: "China is now stepping up harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are taking advantage of the free speech and open press that we enjoy in America to place a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“By contrast, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing, you won’t find many dissenting opinions and get to experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added, “one of China’s largest newspapers declined to publish” his article, although he did not state which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh fad, analysts warn
Since many top Republican politicians support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose sexual assault allegations have surfaced, analysts are warning that they will face a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The sentiments surrounding this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be retracted,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) proposal for a last-minute FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget yesterday’s events – they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been high, it’s true.
But it could have been higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote even if they dislike the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which detailed allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts believed there would be a backlash if Republicans forced the nomination.
“This has become a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or final approval or Kavanaugh’s inauguration — it’s also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that promotes the election of Democratic candidates, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided over whom to believe in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov survey found that 41% of respondents were fully or fairly convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were fully or fairly convinced of Kavanaugh’s account.
In addition, 38% said they were fairly or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s statement, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals to her while they were at a Yale college party in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses the technology of Solid to let people create their own “personal data repository online” or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, work lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data repository online is that it is entirely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company will provide resources, process and relevant expertise to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work on the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren’t talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not they’re going to introduce something completely new, which will completely transform their business models overnight.
“We’re not asking for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new grid built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even if he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross recipient of the First World War
The only priest in the Church of England to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann was awarded the honour on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was unearthed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "great symbolism" that the stone would be uncovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns”.
Later he rushed towards the line of fire and led the line "with great courage" forward before storming a field gun single-handed and knocking out three of the detachments.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he “felt very honoured to play a role in the parade,” adding, “The bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people.”
MMA fans stayed up all night watching the Bellator 206 martial arts program, instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night watching the packed Bellator 206, only to discover you don’t get to see the main event.
The San Jose contestant made it through 13 games, including six on the motherboard and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in Britain were staring as the picture suddenly showed Peppa Pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to watch the game.
One fan described the transition to the children’s program as “some kind of sick joke.”
“It’s state regulation that it’s not appropriate to broadcast such programs at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work on the schedule to include viewers in the UK in the future.
“I think we can figure it out with a view to the rematch,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we won’t be able to resolve this until Sunday our time, Monday your time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me - when we crossed over, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly kind.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won’t happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five games – which we usually send – and we tried to go far for the fans, but tipped over.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it wasn’t until high school that he realized he wasn’t like everyone else.
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he stood up for the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope”.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the traditional program, Kirsty Young, will be away for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared a little lost on Laverne's first broadcast and said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
To this day, it is these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have me the power and strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he “was something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time bronze medalist in the Olympics and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he’s coming forward because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” — he attended his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was tough to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about me winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than a gold medal in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had bought tickets for London 2012 – since he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the run-up to the Olympics and still gives him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson has been selected for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he’ll have to get in shape if it’s not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the Biennial for the impressive 12th time, was benched by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday’s fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, the five-time major-winner divides the day between being a cheerleader and working on his game at the rank in the hopes of righting the wrongs.
The 48-year-old never had the best corner, even at the peak of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough area constantly punishes errant shots.
And if the course itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles games, get off to a successful start, Mickelson’s play could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in her husband, not that he could have said otherwise.
“He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for most Ryder Cup appearances on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible value to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty and likes to make fun of others. He’s a great guy to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun playing against him this week as well and it was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjørn knows his big lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant lead at the start of last day’s Ryder Cup single play can quickly turn into an uncomfortable round.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but picked up the victory by the smallest margin, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but barely,” said Bjørn, photographed after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on that team that this is not over.
You will give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the points on the board.
“We have one goal and that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus is.
“I’ve always said that I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bjørn is delighted with how his players have fared on the tough course and adds: “I couldn’t have done better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow it will be the individual performances that are at the center, and that is something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, your achievements as a golfer are tested to the fullest.
That’s the message that you have to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you’re leaving your partner, and he has to go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great upheavals of the last day; he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up a loser when Europe performed the "miracle at Medinah".
I remember every damned word of it,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had rampaged with his players at the start of the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get off to a good start, like the one we had at Brookline, like we had at Medinah.
When the momentum starts going in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We arrange our setup accordingly and send out the people the way we feel. You know, we’re trying to create something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the playing order.
“I’m betting on this group of men in that order because I think it stands the test of time,” Bjorn said of his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed once again
The German Navy’s newest frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but that won’t happen until at least next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesperson.
The vessel was to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class navy ordered as far back as 2007, will replace the old frigates of the Bremen-class.
It has been agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from home port.
Constant delays mean, however, that the advanced warships – they were said to give Germany strength at sea – will already be outdated by the time they are put into service, Die Zeit reports.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels were to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has an enormous overweight, which reduces performance and limits the Navy's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price tag on the entire project – including crew training – has also started to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government’s defense committee, confirmed that the navy is indeed “running out of usable ships.”
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were decommissioned, but no new vessels arrived.
He regrets that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be used by the Navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
New research carried out at a country estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown-eared and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Experts’ audio analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat droppings and which species do what.
A habitat map and a report will then be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be included in the decision on what measures should be introduced, such as the construction of pastures and how best to take care of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction works that affect breeding sites and habitat reduction.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with flypaper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from house cats.
Bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road as they fly.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, survey breeding sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only separate bat sanctuary at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten species of bat.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have the perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of mapping the bats before maintenance is carried out on a property, since inadvertent destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young, and perhaps wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them, or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish staffer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help in the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species, we simply don’t know how the populations are coping.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Allegations While Lawyers Want to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as “fake news” and said people “want fame” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo dismissed the allegations as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” says five-time winner of the Golden Ball into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's normal.
They want fame by giving my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and I’m fine,” the footballer adds with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable representation of suspicions in the private sphere,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the soccer player would seek compensation for "reputation damage to the extent of the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious privacy violations in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the soccer player’s room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was “99% a good person” who was let down by the “one percent”.
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in hospital, but later they settled out of court because she was “scared for revenge” and was also concerned about “being publicly hanged.”
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to set aside the settlement because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of transitioning from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘will mourn forever’ over loss of car manufacturers
Britain “will mourn forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would halt production temporarily at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delayed border crossing in the event of a no-deal Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“In my view, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal when it comes to how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close the Mini plant at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern revolves around what car manufacturers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a “on-demand” basis and shares parts every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a stay at the border, which the industry says could result in delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day’s stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further ties with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such controls at the border.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy success at the moment, but to seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The message not only from Toyota but also from other automakers is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that increased costs would in the long term reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader at the plant, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s fateful meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred for another week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, threatening Mueller’s independence, has been fueling speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording conversations with Trump and attempting to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to resign voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who at the time was at the United Nations in New York, would take place Thursday.
Trump said he “would rather not” fire Rosenstein, but then postponed the meeting to avoid it clashing with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week’s delay because of everything that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always keen to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Program host Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to dislike of TV reporters’ “self-righteousness,” though she added, “I don’t disagree with their being smug.”
She then suggested that contact between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
“The president is doing more rounds of questioning than any previous president,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve been looking at the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press gets a chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often in the last few weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences at visits of important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible reason, as he undertook a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (State Health Service) to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have been taking place throughout the summer and are expected to land on a settlement in the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate now how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise to strengthen and improve the work of healthcare for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
“Scotland is certainly your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
“He came out on the sidelines and kind of just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to the rear for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is “no information yet on the type/extent of the damage” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transitioning from Illinois.
He had five tackles on the Saturday before he finished the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK. Under new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters
The document tax increase will be collected from those who do not pay tax in the UK
Treasury experts expect it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and hitting high-income groups.
The doc tax increase will be imposed on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will strengthen government action to alleviate the plight of the homeless.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher tariff introduced two years ago on housing number two and home purchases for rent – can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to generate revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” because of the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused major construction companies of keeping house prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing policy.”
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a startling series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unfounded evictions.
He also wants to give local councils more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our degraded housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be the case that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning their own home has become too distant, and the unworthy situation for the homeless persists.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there is always something that draws me back.
However, that opportunity would only come if I succeed in club management.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he was not worried about succeeding such established names in the big club, and has previously declined advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at the moment will be measured by whether I can get the club back into the Premier League.
From the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League.”
It is no easy task to get it there, but I will probably only consider myself to have succeeded here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in charge for three years, following a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint with Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and helped St Mirren from the brink of relegation to win the championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought management was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, made a reasonable income out of it and experienced some nice highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but the management feels just right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable thing I’ve ever known in my adult life.”
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, 30 September, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
Perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, survey shows
The summer heatwave has boosted revenues for Britain’s hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw revenue increase by 2.7% in July – while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who summarized the figures, said: “Still sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup followed a similar pattern in July as the previous month of June, when pubs went up 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had by far the best results, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than what restaurants went down.
Pubs with food service also had a hard time with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the rastaurant drivers.
People seemed to just want to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased 6.6% that month, with food service down 3%.”
RSM analyst Paul Newman said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social events are still the most important factors when it comes to turnover in the outdoor market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a 4.8% year-on-year drop in turnover will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a long-awaited respite.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some are just 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, study finds
A survey of 20,000 middle school students uncovered pages with “fake Insta”.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being shared.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they show their parents.
One in five children – some are just 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed rapid growth in fake Insta accounts — a reference to photo sharing sites on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being shared.
20% of students said they had an innocent “main account” that they show to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Principals’ Conference (HMC) for private schools, revealed that 40% of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief executive Mike Buchanan said: “It’s terrifying that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the 'voice of the athlete' on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of directors of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those leading the sport to gain insight into her extensive international experience over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide athletics community and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be acting as a voice for athletes and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding the sport in Scotland.”
The American won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and has a total of four Olympic golds. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after she had a transient ischemic attack, she was unable to walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I want to recover and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m totally fine and have learned to walk again, and today I’m doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad comparing mums to cows splits public opinion online
A breast pump company has divided public opinion online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump worn snugly against the body,” Elvie, the tech-based consumer goods company, released a fresh and flirty, music-video-inspired ad to show off the freedom the new pump gives active mums.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to a song with, among other things, the following text: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can not see any tail" and "In case you did not realize, this is not udder, it's my tits".
The chorus continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my buns.”
The ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it beautifies the “cruelties” of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth.”

Another commented: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added, “What a failed advertisement.”
One woman admitted that she thinks the song is “incredibly funny.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would love to have one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“This is a brilliant product,” he wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits neatly into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all the challenges, while entertainingly and recognisably showing the incredible feeling of freedom the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has skyrocketed even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have been afraid to ruin their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of individuals seeking to be a supporter of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“Almost 80% of people who are either supporters or members of supporters’ households are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to persecute these people,” says Albence.
The officers are trying to deal with the children more quickly and introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of being arrested, and not 60 days as was the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be portrayed via videoconferencing instead of appearing in person to plead their case for a residence permit before an immigration judge.
Those who are considered to be ineligible asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of developing anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who struggle are more easily overlooked because of the plant size.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can add to the trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “occupiers” to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were staying illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is virtually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more are displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to “carry out this holy struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “all foreign presence.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said conditions are so good that they can return, accusing “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational flight” that keeps the refugees away.
“We have approached the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the rebels’ last major defensive position at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of 3 million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he can soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee, saying that the panel’s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another term
By that logic, Trump would have won reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal make an end to the presidency before then.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic conclusion to a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of seer fatigue.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers in evenings with major news stories.
“This is a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.

Withdrawal is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.

Money from outside flows into the smoothest midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing an influx of money after a congressional district reshuffle that ended with two sitting representatives vying for the same seat.
This newly formed suburban district of Pittsburg features Democratic Representative Conor Lamb—who won his seat in another district in a by-election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania’s 12th district, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were an unconstitutional manipulation of the constituencies in favor of Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign finance between the largest party finance groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely followed by-election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small lead.
U.S. Considered Sanctions Against El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Pulled Threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners ousted the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the punitive measures were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development, and financial aid.
The proposed punitive measures, which included cuts to economic assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
While internal meetings were being held, North American and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in their attempt to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, halting all plans for punitive measures against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomat said.
And the three US envoys calmly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were corroborated by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from History
The next nail in the coffin could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly expanding his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in interfering in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, in the midst of preparations to meet the electorate anew and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not mean to suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be choices made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers stood ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around such tipping points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or retarded.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad mood ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret wiretaps of the president, speculating that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' account is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly launched FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible assault charges and dishonest testimony?”
And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don’t pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I do not think we will fail, because of the experience I got in Prague.
My mother was a Tzsekkoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a springboard to accomplish bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game thinking we could do something and got a point.
Maybe we could have nodded in at the end, but a draw was probably a good result.
They were better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is going to be a big night in Europe.
We are hoping for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home crowd behind us I am sure we can go on and get a positive result.
“Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the replacements at the club itself, but it’s a good feeling now.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
“Hopefully we can go on now, put last season behind us and make it happen.”
Women Lose Sleep Over Fear of Retirement
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family about it.
Around half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the children about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they do nothing to take that call,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
This is how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t say what you want well in advance.
Discuss with the advisor and family where and how the care should be provided, as such choices can have a major impact on determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets — if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Clear away legal issues right away.
Get a health authority in place by appointing someone you trust to oversee your medical care and ensure that your health care provider will comply with your wishes should you be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving someone power of attorney over your finances.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Write down the details in an overview so that you are prepared.

Man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was returning home after a night out.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as an “unmotivated act.”
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Rescue workers have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-magnitude epicenter of the quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, a sub-provincial administrative region, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of Sulawesi's economy, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Emergency Relief Administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurs near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that devastated dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Aceh regency of Pidie Jaya, causing devastation and panic as people were reminded of the ravages of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquake strikes Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on sexual assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, tampering with a report on domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
Palin is being remanded in Mat-Su remand prison and is being arrested for a $500 unsecured promissory note, KTUU reported.
He was brought to court on Saturday, where he pleaded “not guilty, absolutely” when asked about his stance on the issue of guilt, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been indicted.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case will be heard in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, tampering with the domestic violence report and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just off central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the outbreak.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people—a rare punishment not carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he mowed down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and caused serious bodily harm intentionally, under notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for the possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slammed the 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of extortion-related murder, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of vehicle violence and wrecking.
The attack required “significant planning and intent,” said the prosecutor, who described the way Saipov carried it out as “ugly, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, property creations and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the notice states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a case that could carry the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time capital punishment was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to conduct espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a demonstration at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians were to be “feeling the pressure” from eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested he be put in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain “would have been wiped out” now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underscored by the pro-Remain Tories who took part in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted she would go ahead with trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite the backlash – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Bone told the “Withdrawal means Withdrawal” protesters in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan”.
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, telling reporters, “I’m simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular with the general public. The opposition is not going to vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who are trampling the streets and getting us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening".
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage stated that politicians would be “feeling the pressure” if they thought about betraying the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now about the trust between us – the people – and that politician,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to let them know they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilising the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour political rally in the city centre.
A small amount of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis scorned the Tories for the security concerns they had with a party app as the conference began.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It is a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “consider seriously running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts was talking about the future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation about whether she will run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
A contestant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time for “women to get to Washington to fix our flawed government, and that includes a woman at the top.”
Arrested after LSU Sims was shot dead
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, in a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was spotted on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene and was carrying a gun. He admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a two-meter-tall youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims for world title after stall orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stalling order would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got off to a good start and nearly swept Hamilton off the field while defending his position in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue driving in the rear of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some pushing with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free after a double pass to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he lay on the wheels trying to finish quickly and overpower Kimi Raikkonen who was fourth.
He eventually made it to the 44th round depot, but failed to increase his pace in the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me through.
The team has done a fantastic job getting a good two-team squad,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a political event Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are “malicious, nasty, and false.”
“The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and mean and untrue,” he said.
“When you look at deliveries and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I have not done it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her response ... you leaked the document – “oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
I haven't leaked."
Hey, wait a minute.
If we leaked... no, we didn’t leak,” he added, mimicking the senator’s voice.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she requested.”
But her denial was not graciously taken up by the president, who at the party event on Saturday night commented, “I’ll tell you one thing, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power by any means necessary.
“You see the madness, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to override to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5–3 return game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received a two-goal lead early on via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home team before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come behind after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford retired as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt set up for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants were in the lead at half-time when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equalized with a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time during the game late in the second half, and he clinched the victory with the team's fiveers halfway through the final round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of air passengers escape earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died and ensured that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after his colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we heard that,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, and the country's disaster response agency reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The numbers are expected to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the rubble and many have been unreachable,” said the agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working frantically to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military, “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing over 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports a man missing after plane crashed in lagoon
The airline, which owned the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, said one man was missing and all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon, there was one male passenger they did not know about.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a jetty also helped in the rescue effort by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 100 feet below the surface.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst lays out timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed proceedings Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted what he had previously claimed, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers' cell phone during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday, claiming he wasn’t in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer for Sanford that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my trailer was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records suggest that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details, and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is socially engaged hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make socially engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Babysitter in New York sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' message
A babysitter in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from their mother, who complained that she was “another black person.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up for her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEII ONE BLACK PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, a “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that their fired nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that she was expecting someone from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one day of work and then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, claiming compensation in the amount of $350 per day for the six-month, non-contractual accommodation-based scheme she was promised.
“I wanted to show them that — hey, that’s not how you do it,” she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple has fought back against the accusations that they are racist and says the dismissal of Maurice was the only right thing, since they did not feel they could trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We’re not racist,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn baby?
Come on".
Comparing the lawsuit to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had only two months to her due date and was in a “very difficult situation.”
Is this the kind of person you want to punish?
It’s not very nice,” the stockbroker added.
As the legal case progresses, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s shoes when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny to know what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children’s book by a little cloth bear, would have been delighted that his work had been turned down. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was “bittersweet” after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a boastful person,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child doing a feat: you’re proud of it even though it’s not really your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
Upon landing, the daughter was rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say it looked bad, that he didn’t think she would survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the call from Nad saying she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medication the doctors had given her to make her heart beat slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t scream and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull myself together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers—who did not know about the hardships she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I looked down all the time and tears flowed in a steady stream.
It’s hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards With Grieving Women To Prevent Suicide On Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to experience what I have to relive every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They said his smile could light up any room.”
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was one of the people who found him after he killed himself.
Sharon says: “I worry all the time that there will be a contagion effect.”
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit by yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon’s friend for many years, lost Mark, her partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling down or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in our mood.
On Christmas Day, he was in the basement – when the kids opened their presents, they didn’t make eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: “It tears up a big hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we must all persevere and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could get some of the things he was asking for — a time- and scope-limited investigation — maybe we could come to some agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “falling apart” along party lines.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Reluctance was due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 – if Republicans supposedly do poorly, it will be significantly harder for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called around to senators and lobbied for them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to use his double vote and have him put on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'falling' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea’s collection ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices among traffickers, were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most North Korean defectors are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China regards the defectors as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them by force.
The relationship between North and South – which is technically still at war – has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks on the stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no way that we will unilaterally dismantle first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s unfit to sit on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statement in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost shouting and was choking as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also strongly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated character assassination” organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony shows he cannot sit on the Supreme Court since it shows he is biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, he’s unfit to sit on the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the questioning, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he would overrule certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is no time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It’s a righteous rage, months and years where the anger gets the better of her, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that strange, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my supervisor somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that was wonderful.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for resentment in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs was in a male-dominated office. I started crying with inexplicable rage and was grabbed at the collar of my neck by an elderly woman—a cool boss who I had always been a little afraid of—who dragged me to a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry and happy because they caught you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had been working with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was found unfaithful to his spouse on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the race, Schroeder became very frustrated, thinking that there was nothing wrong with investigating the possibility of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was one more.
Some called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since it was nearing the end of the campaign, she was behind on funding and vowed that she would not run if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount, or?” she wonders.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion—gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to raise money and reach voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism—that she collapsed in tears.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls of how the press spoke of her.
“You would think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they would write on my tombstone?
"She was crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, which means tariffs on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, retaliated each time, most recently with a mark-up of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match U.S. attacks for attacks, and the world’s second-largest economy will likely not raise the white flag any time soon.
Getting Washington to de-escalate means yielding to demands, but public submission to the US would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure around the trade war with the US could pay off for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic ripple effects in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the bystanders have realized in the past,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ for return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in restoring the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their everyday lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the insurgency would not be accepted.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during much of the tournament, hit his tee shot in the water at the par-3 16th hole, and had to be beaten by Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current layout in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world’s top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With eight Ryder Cups behind him, Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I’m very, very happy to have the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could be of help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European win.
He hands the baton over to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles play on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely growing up,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, beaten only by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk, after a disappointing performance for his squad, said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw up.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take your hat off.
We were beaten.”
Update on algal bloom: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows an overall decline in red algae concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchy blooms are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County — suggesting reduced concentrations.
A bloom of red algae extends about 210 km along the coast, from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
