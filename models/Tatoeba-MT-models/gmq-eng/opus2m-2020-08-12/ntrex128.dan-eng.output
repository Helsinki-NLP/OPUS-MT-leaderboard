Politicians in Wales afraid to "like fools"
There was dismay among some members of the Walis National Assembly over a proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AM's from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the change in name could lead to ridicule.
A member of the Party Labour said that his group was concerned because "it rhymes at Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Party of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet (fjols).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a draft law on the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on the designations that Members of Parliament will have is of course for the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AM, the Commission preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (Welsh Members) or WMPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to suggest alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the President of the House, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The proposal for a reform contains other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs are given the final vote on what to call them when the draft law is being debated.
Macedonians shall vote to change the country's name.
The voters vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decade long conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province, known as Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbour constitutes a requirement on the territory of Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's attempt to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says that he will abstain.
Members of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is merely a price paid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are getting quiet while the churches in Harlem are fighting
"The older people I have talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People socialize in other ways today," he said.
"Bars no longer make up the neighborhood's living rooms, where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money collected on selling assets will not last long and that they "before or later are back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes, which are full of the kind of people who do not help the neighborhood's recurring sanctuary.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further into the development, where these churches eventually close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the property will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original methodist assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who was at the head of a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets of Harlem, who would not hire or promote black.
A fire in 1939 heavily damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild the building, they ordered the clock game.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who was playing at the bell game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first clock game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's didn't find a substitute for him.
What has been happening in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and entrepreneurs. Some of them obtained by the church leaders, others by the bishopry.
In July, the Council of the congregation – the leading body of the sow, consisting of leading laymen – wrote to the bishops about concerns about the fact that the bishops ' would try to push the expenses forward' to the congregation council, even though the council had not been involved in recruiting the architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishopry.
Haj damages 13-year-olds on a diving trip after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded on Saturday a 13-year-old boy as he dived after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 in the vicinity of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream on help and then along with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just excited to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I got bitten!
I got bitten!"
"All his collar legs were torn up," said Hammel, as he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in critical condition.
It's not known what kind of shark was attacking.
The lumberman Larry Giles said by a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and for carrying out investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take up the beauty market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's takes up competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of supermarkets.
As part of a great effort to take on Britain's beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products are falling. The larger rows of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several shops next year if they turn out to be a success.
The investment in beauty products takes place as the supermarkets look for new goods for shelves used for television, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's says that they double their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more space with branded areas like those seen in shops like Boots.
The Supermarket also renovates the range of Boutique makeup so that most of the products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop tests in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development against the purchase of small quantities of food daily by local merchants means that supermarkets need to do more to make people visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that stores are going to look like supermarkets, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of consumer goods and have made purchases more profitable.
Supermarket's previous attempt to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but the cooperation ended with a argument about how the revenue from the pharmacy in the supermarkets was to be distributed.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain of 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and layout of our rows of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the captivating environment and the practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones "roaring", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones left "roasting", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones furious after she withdraws from their lucrative lifestyle fire at the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "fast" when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she had to deal with over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the headquarters of Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement from this Morning host, which is among UK stars with the highest earnings, can cost the company millions because of large investments in products – everything from powder to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in the launch process.
And it can also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and master Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on holiday together and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby must be the fire ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as hosted on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business actions."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He was laughing at the criticism he would get from the news media to give a comment that "is not a president worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody at a news world.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim is interested in a meeting more after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have come to a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "equivalent response" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial measures against disarmament.
He noted that instead the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure going.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech at his election meeting.
"It's going really well with North Korea," he said.
"There was a plot for war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim had produced positive results – the termination of rocket tests, help with the release of hostages and the return of earthly remains from American military men.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It is so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this densely packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," said Trump and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes defeat island and kill several hundred
In the playoffs of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombox's population were absent, no state of national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling international emergency aid.
"In many cases it has unfortunately been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children brings together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson of the national emergency response, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly exposed, the country is very badly prepared for natural disasters.
There are built tsunami resorts in Aceh, but they are not a common view on other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunami is missing, and it has probably affected the death rate.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Widodo made Indonesia's defective infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by lack of funding in line with the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with macheter, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge cancels at the last moment against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a handover from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind with 1-0.
He stuck to the ball with his left foot before he made a high shot at the back of the pole.
The ball flew high over the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position of getting the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think so much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 by half, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker handed his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he set the pace on the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's court half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the subway.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazeard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished against the remote pole with a shot with left foot past Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Naples in the group game in the Champions League at 15 a.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europa League at 15 Thursday in London.
Death rates from tsunami in Indonesia rise to 832
The death rate from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832 informs the country's disaster preparedness early Sunday.
There were reports of many trapped in the rubble from buildings that fell after the earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the richer scale. It struck Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by boulders from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man of 32 under suspicion of murder, after a woman is involved in death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a cutting wound at 7:55 p.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street.
The police have called on people in the area who saw or heard anything to step forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "We're in the early stages of the investigation, but I'd like to invite everyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I would also urge all, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken up something with dashboards, to contact us as they may have information that may be essential for the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman arrived on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police state that they are in the process of informing the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but is told by the police that no one can get into the building.
He was paralyzed when he heard what had happened.
The residents are now told that there are several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was questioned to a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 a.m. there were two police cars inside the barrier and another car right outside.
A number of officers stood within the barrier and monitored the apartment complex.
All with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and inform log 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's Statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial, which will be the subject of discussion on "Rewriting History"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical, puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an " attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the context of the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The image storm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for his grandfather Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a testimony to attitudes in the 19th century and part of historography for a figure that many still think it is worth paying tribute.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate image is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth tribute and memory."
Killer Pigs attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man who was only identified under his last name "Yuan" was found dead with an overwhelmed pulsary and contaminated in blood near a pig trail on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farm is preparing to give pigs injections with vaccines using a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
He had supposedly traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The following morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig trail next to was open.
He said there was a big snake with blood in his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and injured," said the cousin, who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan went into the market at 4.40 Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking others while the police collect evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and authorities from the market negotiate compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rares, but there are previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg must have a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into his wife frightened the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News said that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just medical.
Those beaks, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of the hurricane Rosa is expected to provide heavy rain in large parts of the south-west United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will produce heavy floods in northern Mexico and southwestern America over the coming days.
Rosa had won 38 m/s, a category 1 orchestra, at 10 Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure outlet across the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula Baja California Monday as a tropical storm, it begins pushing tropical moisture north into the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will provide up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure outlet, which is getting closer, and create heavy rain in the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm floods, liquid falls and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a great likelihood of storm floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn the canyons into blushing rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dust blows.
The approaching low pressure outlet will produce heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which can provide less fluid drop and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first precipitation in their rain time.
Spreaded tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area Four Corners Tuesday and will continue Wednesday.
In October there may be great temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets cooler, but there remains reasonable temperature in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through central United States Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-east areas.</seg>
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long climate forecast indicates that temperatures above average in the eastern United States are highly likely in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million saw Thursday's arresting testimony from the nominated Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was supposedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted the ordinary programs to tell about Friday's late developments: an agreement composed of senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, which allowed the FBI to conduct a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that she's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in drunk state grinned at her and tried to take her clothes off to a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw that Friday.
The company listed average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately available from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a viewer number that corresponds to a match during the NFL playoffs or Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose meaningful hosts have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while demonstrators shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the judgment committee.
He stood with a downward look for several minutes while he was scolded out, and CNN sent live.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing in the committee.
All the television stations covered live a few hours later when the judicial committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination was to proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour, under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominated person in the following week, which the Democrats, who are in subversives of the Senate, had requested.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s elections had an influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the European Union should collect each other's tariffs was "fully ridiculous".
Shooting at Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being behind the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect of the shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of careless manslaughter, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, reported the CBS daughter company WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The coroner in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot that went from the head to the neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, state police lab, Southern University police and citizens in the area has assisted with the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sport leader at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "incarceration and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per fight last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said the team is "knuste" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," said Wade.
The Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ashes spewed from the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Emergency Prevention Centre warned on Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded during 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumble and tremors over several rounds.
Photos of social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in the neighbourhood of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the richer scale, shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The police will meet Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the vote on independence.
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators who wanted independence, together with unrest officers, as several thousand took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the polarist vote of Catalonia on release.
A group of masked separatists held unruly back, threw with and powder painting and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There was also a fight later in the day when the police used their rods to keep the fights down.
For hours, independence groups cried out "No forgotten, nothing forgiven", and were met with Unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage that occurred during the protests reported the local press.
The atmosphere remains high in the independent region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the electoral connection was low, and those who opposed the release boycotted the vote in a large way.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dares to hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy about being given the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they had a narrow, but important, victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have fought to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved themselves into exile or are in prison and await their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, took the protests on his phone in support of the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There's going to be bigger and bigger tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been waiting for his trial since last year, announced that he would make up for the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The position as a candidate in the European elections is the best approach to dispelling the setback in democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 are arrested after a car several times bumped into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19.30 BST.
Detective Bob Blummings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
There may also have been an armpit fired against the car at some point.
Shot from Menga gives Livingston victory of 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The riots Livingston surprised Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 battles as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas shot the difference when Gary Holt's team pulled up side by side with the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team hasn't won off in the league in this season and is going to meet the leading team of Hearts, which they're after eight points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be visiting Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston, in return, extends their undefeated strip to six battles, and chief coach Holt has still not received a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances of cash termination
Holt's team should have been ahead a long time before they scored, and their direct playing style created major problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but handed over across the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the goal, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-cutting header in front of the goal.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could give the outsider troubles in deadball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers made a free park, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created together the structure for Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the defense of the home team, and target Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was taken off with the feet of Rangers painter Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's deadball situations.
There were continuous deliveries into the Livingston field, but were prevented, and two demands for a penalty park – after Halkett's attack on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong results for Livingston.
Everyone played amazingly and exceeds the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and troops are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he entered.
There were a lot of heroes.
Manager Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worralll on his toes throughout the fight.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They have at times been really good under Gerrard, but they played under the level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once they were exposed to the home team – and it is a steep awakening for Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approaches to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but lots of support appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noted and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a whole of some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat of others.
Accidents on the way in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there were rescuers on the scene, but the man died on the scene.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver escaped from the scene, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday’s accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Road barriers have been set up, bus routes have been changed and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during unrest
Six prison officers are injured in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was unrest in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST Sunday, and the unrest is still in progress.
Specialized "Tornodo" officers have been picked up to handle the riots involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on site.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "Especially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing unrests in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear about the fact that those responsible are reported to the police and may end up spending longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmates.
And last October, unrest officers were summoned to prison to deal with serious unrests where employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
The Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm floods (major areas can benefit)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the south-west United States and create the risk of storm floods.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings about storm floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had preserved the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Moglon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin will probably get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storm floods, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will be useful because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to US drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north by 19 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific, and therefore valleys in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit in Mexico with tropical current on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain on parts of Mexico can become powerful and give great risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm precipitation is expected from Baja California to the north-west Sonora with up to 254 mm option", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the border of Arizona early in the morning Tuesday as tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the north-west Sonora and the south-west desert area of the United States", reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life - threatening floods and liquid falls in deserts as well as landslides in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition was reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in the Radstock area, says the police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have called on anyone who may have mobile recordings of the events to arrive.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was under the influence of the democratic party's "badness and anger"
"A vote at Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and monstrous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at an election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been subjected to the "badness, anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh made a statement in front of the Congress on Thursday and strongly denied the accusations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he was sexualizing for her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness explanation at the hearing on his accusations.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the most skilled legal brains of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of Republicans meeting in the polls at the mid-term elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices is in our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me," he said.
"That's why I'm travelling around fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are out on a mission to "strike against and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a person has a high position in the Republican party told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, the death rate is growing
At least 384 were killed and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach, when a great earthquake and a great tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at dusk time, sucked many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake that measured 7.5 on the richer scale.
"When the tsunamitrus arose yesterday, people were still carrying out activities on the beach. They did not run immediately and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster preparedness GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, the dragged cars, wooden trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho and added that the tsunami had moved through the open sea by 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing into trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster response has published aerial photographs showing many damaged buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Detonation continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Board of Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) stated in an announcement that the energy released during Friday's great earthquakes was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami larger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found stuck under the mounds from collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been damaged and 29 reported missing.
Nugroho said that death rates and injuries could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Doggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely paralysed without information" from Doggala, said Nugroho.
"There are over 300,000 living here," said the Red Cross in an announcement and added that their employees and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The Board of Directors was criticized from many fronts on Saturday not to mention that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had come within the time when the warning was sent.
In amateur recordings shared by social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building that desperately shouts warnings about the tsuami coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water strikes the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that diverted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending cargo aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reporting authorities, but there is still a heavy need for food and basic needs among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for auxiliary work, and remains closed in until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami smokes over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins set up in the courtyard at their account. They came past areas with extensive destruction on the road, said Dosesba.
"They told me that they so many broken houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organisations began their hard work to re-establish aid work, complaints came to the effect that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad may only enter if the area in which the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster, we can open up to international assistance, but there's no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held fast in the hope that their closest ones would be the miracles that brighten the sad tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been trapped under the boulders for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandino, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to Asian Games, who ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Monday, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told how in the hours, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who attended the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one grey flybone instead of two blues.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty takes USD 26,750 while filling up ATM in Newport on the Year
Twenty stole Friday morning 26,750 USD from a Brink's-ansat that was fulfilling a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag money that was supposed to have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
All with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the nickname Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande at the show, which cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the show's creator.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier in the year when he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused pages, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed their name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West’s former partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and changed whether the dash is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military power against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has never promised to use military power against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th year for a bloody retribution action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
Tropper shot against a peaceful demonstration in place on 2 October 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements took root in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly government grants to students and opening up more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities attract young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research within the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have given out announcements about artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the lead in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances that the next great achievement in artificial intelligence is achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the Managing Director of the Sinovation Valves, who has invested in one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highly ranked American Othello player, and later he became head of Microsoft Research and Director of Google's department in China.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions supported by the US government, such as Robotics Challenge, held by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come in order to identify the next visionary ones.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government legends, says Lee.
"It is not China that stumbles the academic leaders, it is the big companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should have automatically offered work permits.
The Chinese State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and the distribution of funds by other government organisations to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint centre of artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests over USD 100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which seeks to set up a national safety commission for artificial intelligence, has been standing still for several months.
Macedonians shall vote to change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a decade-old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempt to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country to the north constitutes a claim on Greek territory and has therefore used their veto once Macedonia has applied for accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the primarily Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote and a boycott campaign has given rise to doubts as to whether the majority will be the 50 % required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the vote was, "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price that is worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means more safe lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but I think Members of this House have said that they will comply with the result of the vote and apply it.
The change of name would require a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The election commission of the State said that no irregularities had been reported at 13 o'clock.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent at the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 per cent of the registered voters voting.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a candidate in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change in the country's name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje prepared Mr Kavardarkov, 54, a small stage and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to gain membership with raised forehead, not at the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would provide a strong forced investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think that a large majority will vote in favour because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO," said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "secure of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would take part in the vote – less than the required turnout.
Another poll made by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote shall be at least 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss to the probative government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero fights through the Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester Citys 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score that came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a surrender on the runway at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran quickly past three Brighton defenders before he swung out on the open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a left handover and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to list Brighton painter Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," said the City Manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
"We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate head start of the Premier League game.
That target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero in that sequence received the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice handover along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of contacts before he led Sterling towards the remote post.
The Sky Blues Forward dotted the ball in the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City is fighting Hoffenheim in the group game in the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to fuck Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the caste Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a chance to participate in playoffs for Rockies who have played a game more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies were at least stuck in a wild-card place with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Friday night, but still have their first division title to the benefit of.
"Even if we have nothing to play for, we can go to the fight well knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the enough highest level I will face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet announced their start-up schedule for Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer in like pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his throw Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The right hand player from Washington is on 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings during this season.
Trump holds election meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation of his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans meeting up at the polling stations at the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
That's one of the big, big – you can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me. That's why I'm going around fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats you can see, it happens right now.
And they're determined to get power back with all available means. You can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have as a mission "strike against and block".
"And you have seen it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "worst and evil and disgusting and lying."
He spoke of the chief democratic senator in the Senate's judicial committee, Dianne Feinstein, by name, which triggered loudly the archene from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, wait, just wait, it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted about censoring me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a large number of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome – alone because we have given our opinion.
My colleague in this House, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she strongly rejected anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship was trying to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically enough similar problems in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The call for the meeting at Nottingham East Labour Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as local Members of Parliament, Friday evenings have just been like this.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not that way, and the promise of "friendlyr, softer" politics lies far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become more and more clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed according to whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader when colleagues, whom I previously thought I was sharing political positions with, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never have agreed with – whether it was about national security or the European Union's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and it really doesn't matter what I say – a long strip of rough messages on the social media that calls for the removal and contradiction of the middle-seek policy and tells me that I shouldn't be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are, as a rule, political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the willingness to fight with those colleagues who are all over the world with sexism or racism, but are still fighting.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour was going to create a tolerant culture.
But in reality, it is no longer a spacious organization and with every vote of mistrust or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that if I lay low on myself and I'm not so loud, then I'm gonna have to "something to do".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of thatcher government, who had left our classroom in a falling state, and I sat down to create better public services for those who most need it – whether it has been as a council member or minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with current management.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country comes forward to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But the one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no kind of threat of opt-out or political fitness will keep me from acting on what I believe is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeated Ayr becomes the top team
Two late scorings may have got the final result to draw a not quite true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this fantastic entertaining match of the day in the Tennis's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defence as their better use of chance as the home team, and coach Peter Murchie had the absolute right to be satisfied.
"Our struggles have been demanding so far, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect to Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Clemo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for the Scottish country team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded for the fight of Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo extended Ayr's performance with a penalty park just before the half-leg. He scored and then got a solo-coring, so there were 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious damage. He was carried out out of the field on the stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the headlong with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Fungende Ayr-anger Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and once again Melrose used their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without subsequent kick after a period of intense pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick within the poles and followed up with a more nearly just after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flute player Gregor Henry off to the home track's fifth score.
Still Game star looking for new careers in the restoration industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry after it came to the conclusion that he has taken the directorship of an authorised restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series that he writes and is the main character in along with his partner Greg Hemphyll.
The Duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of the Ampelmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the state of the country Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Seamen patrol around the fleet headquarters, enclosed in rains, in La Paz.
In public buildings, there is a sea blue flag.
The fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout the land of Bolivia, the memory of a coast that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict about resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same is the longing to sail in the Pacific again.
Hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and, of course, waits with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large-screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will agree that Chile – after decades of discussions – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot to do with the judgment of Monday.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take the Bolivian party – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, does not have the power to hand over Chilean territory and has pointed out that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice gives judgment only six months after the closing arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given way.
"The saw of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
Morales' war rhetoric has destroyed the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue their discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreement and gain benefits for both parties", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there is no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never destroy their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with promises made at a Singapore Summit between the rival leaders.
His comments were made following the fact that the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be faced with a restart of the fastened nuclear diplomacy over three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a wish dream that continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to make a declaration as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps first against disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism in relation to whether Pyongyang is serious in relation to abolishing an arsenal which the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Modesshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large head coverings that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted the catwalk veiled for a collection of remarkable headwear of extra size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed Paris Fashion Week.
Very unractic hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was a sumptuous with a feather-like broad shadow that covered the models' heads.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even an pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a snorkel and mask diver thing, and others looked like a melted waffle.
And if you continue the great fashion states, you're lucky.
Style Scouts predict that the huge hats could come to stores near you.
The punch hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60-inch-wide shadow that is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which is behind the highly unractic hat that was spread over the social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange sauna with bass freezers and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in ordinary shops next summer. The designer has had such a big influence that it becomes hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it has continued in 2018 with yet another number of unique examination results, which are even strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As a training sector that can put together and implement a tailored curriculum, we find that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest survey results this year that languages are highest in statistics with the most passed exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS's 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of the students received the grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages are now perceived at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathhamatics) in independent schools' brushes and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills carried out in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers were unable to fill job vacancies, 17% had to do with lack of language skills.
That is why language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will in future require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career the young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a life-long skill like this.
The possibility of communicating directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start to competitors.
According to a YouGov measurement of over 4,000 respondents in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
It is therefore important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children are better placed to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills needed to achieve success, no matter what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in the training.
Modern languages should, in fact, be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to Scotland's youth.
Il faut bien le fiaire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to watch LeBron James play his first fight for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James plays in the Sunday opening game before season start against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet true how many minutes he plays.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the whole game.
After the training earlier this week James was asked about his plans compared to Lakers' planned six matches before the season start.
"Where I'm in my career, I don't have to fight before the start of the season to get ready," he said.
Trumps election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a stripe election meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first out of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed Judge to the vacant seat at the Supreme Court is suspended, Trump is trying to create support for the forthcoming mid-term elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trumps election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held at midnight (Danish time) the night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trumps election meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, which are nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense because of the accusations of sexual infringing behaviour, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the accusations.
But the main objective of this strip of electoral meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans who face a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign said that the five election meetings next week are aimed at "creating energy among volunteers and supporting when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Controversy of Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, now that we enter the busy campaign," said a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
The evening's election meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who lies behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has to step up to give him a boost in polls," said Simon Haeder, who deals with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team The United States has shown the struggle and is trying to keep hope alive before Sunday's single duels
After three unilateral rounds, Saturday's four-man duels were perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum is a totally invented concept of sport, but a concept that players believe in – not least by competitions like this one.
Where would they say there is momentum now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we'll probably see a little bit as momentum," said Jordan Spieth before he held four o'clock.
Of course, Europe has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead and there are 12 more points to replay.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have suffered wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud shouts of cheer grew higher as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important cushion, which ensured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two blows backwards after two duels.
His cushion, which secured them the fight on the hole 15, was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just have to find the inner strength forward and focus on your own struggle," said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the biggest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but sympathetic couples have got four points in four battles and appear to be flawless.
"Molwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bookey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bookey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience show that it is them that it becomes the hardest to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were to be dominated by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Most importantly, synchronous on each of their holes.
It is, however, too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning in the four-man duels when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two double bowies on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the swedish into a hole they were never near to get out of.
Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The struggles with four balls and two hold a two players are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way, the strategy lightning fast can change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man pigeons have also shown that Team USA has the fighting gesture that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates 10-6 lead-up before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a drive across the United States of 10-6.
The well-played duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a difficult Tiger Woods and have so far got four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the bag they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unprecised American team in the morning fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes, they won four games, but they were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 single matches if they need to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European debutante who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have got the nickname "Molliwood" is after a sensational weekend the only other couple in Ryder Cup's history, who have won four points in their first four games.
They smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then beat elegantly a discouraged Woods and the American debutante Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games on Saturday, had little brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning fourballs and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and got a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is number three in the world.
However, Europe has it quite as they want it, on an easily windy day southwest of Paris.
Triple Major Wins Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard fight 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before the single fights. However, since Furyks currently has the bag, they only have to be undecided to keep it.
After two days of second-best interests, however, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says that they will not destroy unilaterally if there is no trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthen their mistrust of the United States and that it will not give up their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the general assembly of the worldwide organization that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" in recent years, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, settling an area for nuclear tests and laws not to further develop nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we haven't seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no trust in our national security and under such conditions there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and destroy unilaterally."
Whenle Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-separated" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. However, his speech seemed important as it did not unambiguously reject unilateral disarmament, as it has otherwise been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint announcement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a seated U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has requested a formal end to the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to softening international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose at coercion and even opposes the 'Declaration of the End of War'," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us in our knees is a dream of wish among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a summit more between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the last five months and added: "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked up."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea's rockets against the U.S. mainland was inevitable, after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "rocky man" on suicide mission.
Last year, Trump in the United Nations threatened with the 'total destruction' of North Korea, but this year he commended Kim for showing courage in terms of disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions have to remain until North Korea destroys.
Wednesday Trump said that he did not have a timetable for these actions, but said "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, definitive, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sideline of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours after accused him of making "gang-like demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent steps", he demanded, were the security promises that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take the course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The aim of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture in which you study all night kept up with large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world's best university often do not know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, who is professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea of the course after holding a paper on the effects of sleep failure on learning.
"When the setup was completed, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get this to know now that I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleeping habits can improve your academic and sporting performance as well as your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the university's health area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleep shortage during the week.
The hour-long course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a dorm room where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how your sports performance is influenced by lack of sleep and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants will hear about how long-term lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campuses.
"We know that it will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know how cigarettes affect health", adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride of taking a 'alnighter' still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to sleep shortages being a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain, because sleep lack makes the brain think that you are starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old californier who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler last year to organize the course when he took one of his first year courses at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next thing will be that all graduates are offered a similar course before they continue their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set up an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens that can move at the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Dimensions from Menga lower Gerraard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the outskirts, as Dolly Mengas's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's uncoherent team had to thank with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was looking for their first victory on the field since 4-1 triumfen on St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gernard only another defeat in 18 games as coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts in the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Ranger team could not respond to.
Rangers now go down to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to a third place after Hibernian with only the goal score to the difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as Line Judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a cast object that seemed to come from the outboard section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the set-up that reached the Betfed Cups semifinal by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, stood with the same 11, who shaved a point of Hearts' conduct last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhausted the opponents all over the track.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the game when Mengas first delivered Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midway player's attempts ran by.
A frispark in the depths from Keaghan Jacobs found way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow kicked past the back of the pole.
Rangers, however, took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
In any case, Alfredo Morales was not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson failed the columbian appeals of the Penalty Park, when he and Steven Lawless broke together after a quarter of a game.
Rangers managed only two shots on target in the first half, but former Rangers target Liam Kelly did not have problems with the Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejaria's tamme shot.
Although the opening of Livis in the 34th minute was a coincidence, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle a deadball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga, who could easily kick it in goal.
During the break, Gerraard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave pote, when the flyer sent the ball in to Morelos, but the playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the outside team to play on their points with many long balls up the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the final part of the fight, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goal.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penalty park after being dried up with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the other way.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Søndag Morning": 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we TELLE... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a permanent component of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the film "Bells of Coronado" from 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main roles of the peasant scientists:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals makes."
Evans: "Hold it up, now it's time!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he wanted 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a range of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein named HER2, as many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "gets several cancers to develop", including breast, ovate, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach in taking immune cells out of patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave Trump friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well
After an uncoherent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was arched when he hailed the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he himself would be a presidential candidate in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again case, he began a dundertale against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have long since moved from the United States," he said.
SNL started the evening show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's court committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the recordings were not shown, the comedian Chris Rock Wests tapped on the social media.
It's not safe if Rock tried to exhibit West by opening the footage.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage because of his head covering.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And they said that I had sunk deep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I'm sunk?" and said that he would put on his Superman cap, because that means "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try with love."
The public bowed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassingly concerned, says Variety with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a bombing in the studio."
West had been booked as replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose then girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: DO NOT TAKE YOU OF THE PØBLE."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "as he is, and that's fine."
"But I DO NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art") who embraces and exhibits an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so have we," she added.
Before the show the rapper had announced that he has taken the change of name to the "entity which is officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who changed his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapkollegen Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Know as Prince.

The charges are reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to swing swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval-fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs for the stereotypical macho hero and says that this kind of TV character means that young men often feel that they have to be hard to be respected.
Kit said to the Sunday Times Culture that he believes that something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies "very in mind".
"For the time being, it's very much in my mind – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what is it then that we have learned young men in their growth?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculineity due to the very masculine characteristics.
He went on to say, "What is innate, and what is yours?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he would not make successors to the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he is "complete with battlefields and horses".
Kit is involved from November in a remake of Sam Shepards True West, who is the story of a film director and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best part of the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so in this way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in which Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's land in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 % increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, says the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people getting HIV in this way has been reduced to something near zero, says Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legitimised, but discrimination against LGBTs is, in effect, a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women sooner or later because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of use of contraception in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denys that staff leaked data on Republican senators and argues against "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the Representatives House Maxine Waters denied this Saturday's accusation that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Party from Los Angeles claimed that the claims originated from websites and supported from "the extreme right wing".
"Lews, lies and more terrible lies," wrote Waters in a Twitter paper.
The published information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of the American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of which are from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill. It happened during a hearing in the Senate dealing accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of the Waters staff, The Hill writes.
"This unfounded charge is completely untrue and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"The members of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations are by no means responsible for this leak of information.
This unwarranted charge is completely untrue and a direct lie."
Waters' announcement quickly got criticism online, including from former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, you can't get angry.
You can't get stubborn.
You can't question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep your mind calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, which was criticised for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also made his opinion known on Twitter.
"Big, if it's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official announcement she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the police regarding these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again – subversive spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all newer movies with a British ice cream, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will dry, sarcastic self-satire, if how grunting it is with us, become the country's new export option?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his rubber face and the big eyes have been allowed to make the roarers over again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comical find aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the duped secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean and properly dressed by him who carried a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international locust that left chaos in his wake, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television advertisements.
There are some good moments in this recent shot on the trunk of JES.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers rang against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but humor feels quite subversive and strangely redundant, especially now that more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The mood seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film flickers in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinite starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An Internet hijacker has infiltrated England’s top secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the dismay of the responsible agent – a sadly small role to Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and fightable Prime Minister who already suffers a complete melting into political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
As her security advisors inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is forced to retire someone's pension.
And of course, it's the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a senior school principal, but who in hiding teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for a kind of School of Rock training in espionage.
English has to be moved back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with its hard tried previous right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overenthous but well-meaning submarine captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine played.
Thus, the royal intelligence service's all-round surroundings of Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is stumbled close to getting involved with the charismatic and scary tech billionaire Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: Dressed as servants they set fire to a noble French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates clean ▪ok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the final sequence of the film, but no matter how well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of child television over it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I could not avoid thinking with the other Johnny English films: can the English film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to bridle with a plan of four-day working week with unchanged pay for the British
Jeremy Corbyns Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can settle with a four-day working week, but get paid for five.
The party is supposed to have managers to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an additional day off.
This would mean that the employees would have three days of weekend without going down to pay.
Sources state that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic objective of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from an economy in change.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the case is not supported by unanimity in the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting drawing up his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell states that he is determined to rip the power back from "anonymous directors" and "explotors" in utility companies.
The shadow finance minister's plans also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour at the head could "discount" them in the light of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to get workers in company boards and to set up including owner funds, which will distribute 10% of the equity value of private companies to employees who are to receive up to £500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's finding could cause the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was shown this Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something forward that could make them change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, "Did you do it?"
He was steel-plated, firmly and unambiguously."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to be e-mailed in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett denied it strongly," added Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
That happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it had to change anything."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York Host City of the Global Citizen Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive selection of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will for the seventh time receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park's big lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will bring attention to the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organisation that is struggling to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concerters must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, make voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or another meaningful action that can bring attention to the goal of making an end to poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Creates the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" – that people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter lookup?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different objectives.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding objectives and political measures that amount to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group listed 390 objectives and actions that had emerged due to their actions, which ran up to over $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has started in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong people. They strive to "help children to live out their full potential" and promise 35 million dollars to address nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, the social injustice of malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online calls. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions, which reads: "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the movements against Apartheid, it will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performances of this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to "bloom" for Russian energy exports, says the U.S. Minister for the Interior
"If necessary" Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from coming to the market, including in the Middle East, reveals the U.S. Minister of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiners.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where they operate on the invitation of the rightful government – is a pretext for expanding its sales of energy.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe", he must have said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"USA, with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the waterways, and if necessary, we can also block them, so that we ensure that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinc spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organisation that views itself as "the voice of the American energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that they are basically the same.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about using and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, spokesmen of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 management project which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong resistance to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose supplier," said the Russian Energy Minister, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to interfere beyond EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem with the involvement of a third party in our energy supplies," said the head of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to make up for the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator from Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to make up for the presidential elections after the mid-term elections, she said Saturday.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about setting up.
"It's time women went to Washington and repaired our political system, and it takes a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider very much making up for the presidential election."
Warren gave his opinion about President Donald Trump during the City Council and said that he "leads the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been pronounced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course the FBI will investigate the matter before the vote."
However, a Thursday poll shows that the majority of Warren's own backland does not believe that she should set up by 2020.
According to a poll from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32 % supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support to former Governor Deval Patrick with 38 % for and 48 % against a possible establishment.
Other high-profile democratic candidates discussed in connection with the presidential elections in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden states that he will notify his final decision in January, writes Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at an election meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he comes home makes me relate to other families who notice the consequences of PTSD and other injuries with which our soldiers return home," she told the audience to a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elefant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and think whether there is respect for it, their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the reporting of domestic violence and to have a weapon in drunk state, says Dan Bennet, a spokesperson for the police in Wasillas.
18 states and D.C. support resistance to new asylum laws
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new US law that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a partial declaration in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The applicant's full name in the case of Grace vs. Sessions lodged by the Union of American Civil Liberties in August against the federal law has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers are tribes, as countries with far-reaching problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum law rejected a decision by the U.S. Foreign Affairs Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia State Law, Karl Racine, stated on Friday that the new law "is excluding decades of state, federal and international legislation."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on in the light of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle," states the party-independent declaration.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law to reject immigrants harms the US economy, as there is a higher probability that they will become self-employed and "provide the necessary workforce."
In June, Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions took the right to grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political stand," said the Sessions in their decree of 11 June.
It has never been intended that asylum should address all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people throughout the world face every day.
While the death rate is doubled, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For survivors, the situation just got worse.
"It's very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little fever-affected boy at a evacuation centre in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with corpses.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their destroyed homes to sort in wet properties and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured, and the hospitals, also hit by the 7.5 earthquake, could not follow.
Some of the injured people, including Dwi Haris, who broke their backs and shoulders, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to severe restraining.
He got tears in his eyes when he told me how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There wasn't time to save ourselves.
I was mashed up against a broken wall, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and added that his family was going to the wedding in town.
"I heard my wife shout for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American newspaper that hit a drum for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, the American ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The American president, Donald Trump, referred Wednesday to China Daily's paid intruder in Des Moines Register – Iowa's best selling newspaper – after accused China of interfering in the 6th of November. China rejects the accusation.
American officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the American elections marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked up in an escalating trade war where they have put customs duties on each other's imports.
China's return duties in the trade war were to be imposed on exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, American ambassador in China, former governor of a number of years in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural food to China, stated that Beijing has injured American workers, farmers and companies.
Branstad wrote in a leader in the Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "takes up the use of the unfine methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by running a paid ad in Des Moine's Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, however, there will be few disagreements, and you will not get a true picture of the Chinese people's different attitudes to China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under tight control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women before the mid-term election with the Kavanaugh case, warns analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The case has put emotion in the boil, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be done about," said Grant Reher, professor of State Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said that he doubts that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona) request for an FBI investigation for 11 hours will milden the anger of voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they don't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill last Friday.
On Friday morning the demonstrators cried out during a demonstration in the Senate: "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who control the Legal Committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," told the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say that it has already reached a high level; it is true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among women swingers in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, despite not to like the President."
Even before Ford's public accusations of the sexual abuse of the Supreme Court of Appeal, analysts had pointed out that it could give back if the Republicans continued to do so.
"It has become a worse mess for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the committee's vote or the final result, or about Kavanaugh being held accountable; it is also about how the Republicans have handled it here and how they have dealt with her," says Guy Cecil, chairman of the Priorities United States – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views on who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 % of the respondents certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 % said that they certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 % said that they thought that Kavanaugh was either probably or certainly lying under his testimony, while only 30 % said the same thing about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the accusations presented by Ford and at least another, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told her last week, under oath to the Senate's judicial committee, that Kavanaugh was fully courting her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Courtnominated her sex parts to a party when they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the Internet is planning to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology doctor is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We'll have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to determine who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal expression through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to gather resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps by using the tools available on the Inrupts website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely, so all their business models suddenly become redundant."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a paper on Media this Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupts "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet that is being built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is being launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vatten: Gestligt receiver of the Victorian Cross of World War I is hailed
The only priest of the British Church who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglisse and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic", that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's orderly achievement.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann, on September 29, 1918, led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fires from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led with the "greatest manhood" of his people before he alone attacked an artillery and unharmed three cannons.
Lieutenant-General Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael won at 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Water also laid a wreath after the parade, which was stated by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honored to take part in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but got Gurli Gris instead
Imagine you've stayed up all night to see the starry Bellator 206 and then you're denied to see the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown through the night in England at Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald got ready to meet each other, the viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were uncomplicated after they had stayed awake until the early morning for this particular fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a child-eating movie as "a kind of sick joke."
" According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 o'clock in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Grisen Gurli, yes."
Bellator's Managing Director, Scott Coker, stated that they would work to include English viewers in the planning process in the future.
"When considering the return, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But the clock is six Sunday mornings over there, and we won't find a solution to it before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I was replaced, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to repair it, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was actually the law.
I can promise you, it won't happen next time.
We only had five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minor value" over sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt less valuable than everyone else in his childhood because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't happen to him before he came into the larger classes that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexuals' rights to give other "hope".
He also said that he went less into winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host on the radio program, which has been driving for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken off a few months because of illness.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his childhood, because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, "From today on, the feelings of feeling worth the memory and feeling different are the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a high-profile LGBT champion and used his participation at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences and he would give other "hope".
The triple world champion said that he had been "surprised" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told him that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told me that it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar up and downtimes when going through so much at such a young age – he went to his first OL at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective had changed".
"If you had asked me last year, it would all be if I were to win a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as a 40-year-old after having had diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley told me his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had got tickets for London 2012 – when he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first came to my mind that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the Olympics 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that's what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first song – Proud of Heather Small – which had meant much during the uptake to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unsharp Mickelson on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it's not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who records for the 12th time being in competition, which will be settled every 2 years, was placed on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events for the United States as usual, the five - double - big winner had to act cheers and practice his game in the hope of correcting the faces.
Even at the height of his career he had the most equal drive, so the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long run often punishes lost shots.
And if the course wasn't a big enough mouthful, by the ninth game on Sunday the always precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, starting the 12 single fights, start strongly, then the Mickelson fight can be decisive.
Fury did not express surprising confidence in her teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a clenched back, laid his arm on me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined he was going to play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everybody else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Falllo's record beats for most games played in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been able to fully measure itself with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven unsolved, although Furyk said that his presence contributes to something undefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, wise, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the teamroom," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just the game."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great movement can quickly disappear
The European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid run before the last day of Ryder Cups single play can quickly become nervous.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a head start of five points over the Americans, but was just getting caught before the finish with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice ride in Valderrama, we had a nice ride in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just won," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total performance of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's supposed to have a full garbage tomorrow.
Go out and do everything the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus lies.
I have always said that I am focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world."
Pleasant of the performances of his players on a hard track, Bjørn added: "I'm not taking any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that count, and that is something quite different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all parameters like golfing.
That's what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he also has to get the best out of himself."
Also, it looks like the opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced any conversions on the last day. First on the winning team in Brookline before he lost when Europe made the "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said, when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one wants a good start, as one saw at Brookline, as one saw at Medinah.
Once the momentum has found a direction, it puts great pressure on the middle struggles.
We put our team together in relation to it and put the players on the track in the order we feel for. We're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the retreat and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warship is being postponed again
The German fleet's latest frigat should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, the Germans have to wait at least a year yet due to technical problems and an escalating price, writing local media.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of fresgatter, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a spokesperson from the military.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but after-delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, are to replace the aged frigates from the Bremen class.
They know that they want a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-air shuttles and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are supposed to cause Germany to appear as an overseas force – will already be out of date when inserted, write Die Zeit.
The failed F125 report created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
It was not much known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors", which made the warship useless in battle situations.
Software errors were of particular importance when the ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half the crew from the older Bremen frægatter.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's potential for future updates.
The 7000 ton of heavy "Rheinland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, which includes training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached bleak 3.1 billion € (3.6 billion dollars), with an initial price of 2.2 billion €.
The problems with the latest frigates become even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet power shrinks.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government's Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "runs out of ready-made ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He regretted that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Sneaks to the Secret Life of the bats
New research from an area in the highlands of Scotland is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is carried out by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and follows ordinary bats, dwarf bats, long-tear bats and waterflag mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed in carefully selected locations in the area to take up the activities of bats during the season.
Data are also collected by NTS personnel and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bats and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape view of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS Rob Dewar Nature Conservation Adviser hopes that the results reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the various species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows, and how to best conserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect shipowners and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also present a danger. The same can be fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks by pets.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to find insects and fly outside obstacles.
NTS, responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect shipowners and sometimes do rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the area of Threeave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bat species.
The area's manager, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and the whole good habitat.
There is much you don't know about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasises the importance of looking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks on property, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young people.
Flagermus is protected and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or their shipowner.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Project Leader of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations evolve."
Ronaldo rejects rape prosecutors while lawyers sue German journals
Cristiano Ronaldo has called raping charges against him for "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are getting ready to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he has paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, wrote Der Spiegel last Friday.
Some hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel because of the charges they have called "an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions of the privacy sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class corresponding to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident was reportedly taking place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he must have raped her anally according to the report submitted in the city court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" gripped by "one percent".
The case papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got photographed her injuries at a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "bang for retribution" and worried about being "publicly spoiled".
The 34-year-old now says she's going to overturn the deal, as she's still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event was supposed to have taken place, and changed this summer to the Italian big club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it lost its status as a leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "announcing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of these were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain goes out of the European Union at the end of March," said the Managing Director at Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says that they will close their Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is to deal with the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a withdrawal without agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, said the company.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the European Union is "complicated, so that we can precisely avoid these surveillances at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement, which not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have been stopped, but in the longer term, higher prices would reduce factory competitiveness, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come again."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed one more week", as the statement about the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House this Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special prosecutor Robert Mueller over the debt during his investigation of Russian electoral interference, links between Trump's helpers and Russia and the President's possible obstacle to the course of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby risking Mueller's independence, has been a gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering carrying a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of placing the President on the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was held on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he would "don't prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Committee of Justice, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, would testify.
Last Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed Senate elections.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I like always keeping the press updated."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to television journalists' game for the gallery, but added: "I do not disagree that they play up to the camera."
She said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The President receives more questions from the press than any president before him," she said and added without quoting a source: "We have looked at the figures."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to give rich opportunities for this, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press meetings with senior guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he did an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Minister of Health contacts EU staff in the Scottish Health Service after Brexit complaints
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and desire that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain withdraws from the European Union.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the course of the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal have continued and it appears that decisions are expected this autumn.
But the British Government has also increased their preparation for any Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts made by each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Collegiates from and outside the EU come with valuable experience and competences, which strengthen and improve the work of the health care system for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we very much want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having suffered a head injury on Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports it from Tennessee's Mike Organ.
First coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell about out there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they put him on a stretcher and took him in for further investigation.
A spokesperson from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no "any details of the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he suffered the damage.
Abercrombie is studying in the second year and is starting his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles this Saturday before he left the game, which gives him 18 tackles gathered this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp taxes when purchasing houses in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamps when they buy a property in the UK. The extra money, according to the Conservative Party, must help the homeless.
This move must dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will hit those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to provide 120 £ million a year for homeless people.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp fee when they buy properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The draw will be seen as an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper homes and going after them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The income from this must be used for the government's struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added in addition to the current stamp levy and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent, can reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by people living abroad, making prices rise and make it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot inside the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spoke cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp levy in order to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying reasons they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap dwellings to solve Britain's "cumberful housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching series of housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the removal of the landlord's ability to put people on the street if they comply with the rental contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public residential buildings.
May said: "Last year I said that I would use my Presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be true that it is just as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as hardworking Brits.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still far too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
The boss of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become Scotland's coach.
The shot at 42 enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East Club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He switched to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always pulled me.
However, that option would only arise if I have success in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors who train for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says that he did not have concerns about following then established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success based on whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
From the structure and facilities of this club, it no doubt hears at home in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I guess I'll only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as a coach after a period of assistant training at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloa to come back after moving down in the third best row and transformed St. Mirren from the brigade to the title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That's probably a real way to get a divorce," he remembers about the time in Alloa.
"I sincerely thought that training was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, made sense and had some success experiences.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you're going through on a weekly basis.
There is still the kind of stress and pressure that train, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it. I haven't been more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5.30 p.m., shows the study
The heat wave this summer has increased the earnings of England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have decreased by 4.8%, shows figures.
Peter Martin, who is a business consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpected long World Cup have meant that July follows June's pattern, where pubs experienced more sales of 2.8%, except that restaurants are harder hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of drinks made it clearly best and experienced progress similar to the decline in restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Throughout pubs and bar chains, the sale of beverages increased by 6,6 % per month, while the food fell by 3,3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sale on the out-of-home market, weather and major social or sporting events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that the restaurants are still fighting, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% year after year will do really bad even in rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a hard needed breathing room."
The total increase in sales totaled for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7 % in July, which shows the decrease in newly started fires.
Coffer Peach Tracker, who monitors sales figures for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than £9 billion, and they are leading in this area.
Every five children have a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents
Every five children – down to 11 years – have secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, show research.
A study of 20,000 school students in 4-9th grade reveals growth in "Fake Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being raised
20 % of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show to their parents
Every five children down to 11 years create accounts on the social media that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from the fourth grade and forth reveals violent growth in "Fake Insta" accounts – a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being displayed.
20 % of the students said they have a "main account", which they can show to their parents, while they also have private ones.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teenager calling on others to rape me.
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40 % of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's scary that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and President Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions on sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the Atletian world of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the Atletik in Scotland will benefit from getting her on the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help out in developing a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-metre courses at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, and now often commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transitory ischaemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show if I wanted to get on top of it and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm perfectly well, I've learned to go again and do today's agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump that compares mothers to cows gets mixed reception online
A chest pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first soundless chest pump", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a costume filled with hay, to a song in which it says, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see any tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, this isn't the world, it's my breasts."
It says, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my barmage."
However, the advertising, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say that it makes fun of the "rears" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote a user.
Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in an amme bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: "Certainly enough traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the ad, a woman admitted that she thought the song was "unbelievably funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd have had one.
Lactation made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like 'køder'.
It is not an advertisement that commends or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind advertising is based on the fact that many women who breast-feed say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in an amme bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in an entertaining and recognizable way we showed the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time that the Elvie pump created headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Several hundred migrant children secretly moved to tent camp at Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of borderers has not changed. It is partly due to a harder rhetoric and the trump administration's more stringent laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to stay in the country by presenting themselves and receiving a child.
The return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of Immigration and Customs Forcement, witnessed to Congress and told them that they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had pure criminal record.
"Staying at 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households, they reside illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are alien criminals.
So we're still hunting those people," said Albence.
In the attempt to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of even meeting up and speaking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those judged unfit for stay are quickly deported.
The longer children stay in custody, the more likely there is for them to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or escape attempts, says it from relief workers and in reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who adopt better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced on larger installations like Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on whether a child is suffering.
They added that relocation to a tentland village without mental preparation or the possibility of saying goodbye to friends can build up traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria shall notify the United States, French and Turkish "conservation forces" that they shall withdraw immediately:
When the Foreign Minister of Syria, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will “be met with similar means.”
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror "nearly is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleared all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the field of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spoken unwarranted fear", which led the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what was supposed to be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no help will be provided to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebellious city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Because of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia was avoided against the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would follow jihadists from the Nusra Front, a source group of Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed".
The UN's sending Staffan de Mistura hopes to call the first meetings of the new committee to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for a election.
Moualem has set conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and states that the panel's work must be limited to "to review the legislation of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential term.
Based on this logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the case and scandals end his pre-time term, which many liberals may hope for.
In what no doubt becomes "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!"
There are currently no signs of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the best transmission time has almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time for comparison with 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million on evenings with great news.
"It's a spectacle that people get attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the ABC drama Designed Survivor about a head of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," said Scovell.
The chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other television programmes, the stories coming from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged astonishment.
And yet it's about more than being enlightened citizen when you see six-hour panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's ostrich jacket at $15,000 ("Hybris covered", The Washington Post) and the implications of Storm Daniels' live descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
At least I never want to see Super Mario the same way.
"Something that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the rotating crew and daily surprises of the Trump show (brothers with N.F.L., rose to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he was taking CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate's judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find way to the close mid-term elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of the compensation of two "Congressional Districts" two congressmen fight for the same seat.
This recently surrounded suburb district of Pittsburg creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb stands up against another member of the Congress, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which greatly overlaps with the new 17.
The cards were reworked after Pennsylvania's Supreme Court in January convicted that the old district was unlawfully placed in the favor of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has started a fight for financial resources between the committees of the big parties, the Democratics' Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-wave election in March for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been on the Republican hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a little advantage.
The United States was considering punishing El Salvador for aid to China, but it changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw the Trump management team out.
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back leading American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision no longer to recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in an announcement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received about $ 140 million of the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The penalties proposed, which include cuts in financial assistance and restrictions on admission permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials made a top conference on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which was considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
In mid-September, however, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway and thus dropped the thought of punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal of the importance that Americans put in the meeting said diplomats.
And the three U.S. agents secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh demands or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case, which was described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst, who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Know the story
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to investigation, for which there are considerable and publicly available evidence.
It is claimed that Mueller will also direct his investigation into the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the election.
If Congress were to come on new hands, Trump would probably be held accountable while he is preparing to again meet the voters and, of course, in time a jury of his rims.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trumps is ultimately inevitable – as is his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the struggle will continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to put in a coup against Hitler if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the ominous bloodbath thereafter.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is turning, and the inviolable march of democracy is sinking.
In the United States, we are now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who determines the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Minister of Justice, Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since this newspaper could announce that he had proposed to make hidden recordings of the President last year and challenged his suitability for the office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not carried out properly – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false evidence?
And, more importantly, will we vote in favour of a Congress to hold Trump responsible for the mid-term elections?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the very Nazi regime, who once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to turn on the Sabbath lights on the table with the garden cross.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic before the fight against SK Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Thursday against SK Rapid Wien. After the impressively undecided result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will have good opportunities with a victory against the Austrians to move on from Group G of Europe League.
A knee injury prevented the midway player Graham Dorrans from getting the season debut before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but all that was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last match. But with the audience behind us, I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can go on now, put the last season behind us and get success."
Anxiety over pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, there were only a few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationswide study reported that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Deputy Vice President of the National Wides Life Insurance.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not tell them in good time about your wishes.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices may be determining factors for the costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, among other things, by means of traditional long-term insurance, life insurance with cash payments or self-insurance with your own resources – as long as you have financial resources for it.
Get the legal documents fixed: Take the legal battles into the riot.
Get a proxy so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and health care professionals comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider, too, an economic proxy.
In that case, you will appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aged parents needs urgent medical care and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medicine?
Who's watching the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a walk in the city.
The victim was in the 40's and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, middle floor and hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as "really random."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police urge witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami which hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communication roads are out of play, emergency aid workers have not been able to receive information from the Doggala Regent, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of the Central Sudanese province and is at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Doggala is a regent that extends over more than 300 km of coastline on the north-west part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the Central Sudanese economy, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster center, Palu and Dongila have been hit by tsunami several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongila.
In 1996, Doggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed you.
Indonesia is seismically on the so-called fire in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and only in April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake that measured 6.8 hit south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that burst on the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7,5 hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya Regent in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, preventing the reporting of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to the report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is the custody in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a guarantee of $500 with no security, reports KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not to blame", reports the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B infringement, which can lead to a penalty of a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of having attacked his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is pending at Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, to have prevented the reporting of a violent crime at home as well as the possession of arms in the affected condition of the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of having given her a hit on her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining his son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on Friday hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of central Sulawesi, which is north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media, videos are circulating that show the moment where the earthquake hits.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami burst on the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get terrorist suspects in NYC sentenced to the death penalty.
Public prosecutors are trying to have the death penalty imposed on Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare punishment that was last convicted of a crime in the state in 1953.
30-year-old Saipov used a rental car from the construction market in October, Home Depot, to carry out an attack on a bike path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were meeted down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov 'intentionally' killed the eight victims and 'intentionally' caused serious personal injury.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these claims.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov with 22 points, including eight charges for the murder of gangsters, typically used by public prosecutors in organised crime cases, and an accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "extensive planning and preparation", said the prosecutors and described Saipov's execution as "unholy, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, body injury and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Claves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrichi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states the declaration of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was a decade ago that the South District of New York last raised charges in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ended up having the lifelong prison sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was last imposed in a state case in New York in 1953. At that time, the couple were executed on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, showed no sign of any sign in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was feeling good about his actions.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag up to his hospital room, told the cops.
He has refused to take charge of the 22 points of the accusation.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they "of course were disappointed" by the decision of the charges.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong prison sentence without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma of all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the allegations not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister thinks NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the armies" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians had to be able to "mark the pressure" from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the European Union.
The Private Conservative MEP Peter Bone said to the demonstration in Birmingham that Britain would have been "out now", if Farage had been Brexit's dealer.
May's challenge to creating a gathering in the deeply divided party is highlighted by the fact that conservative remainers participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track during attacks by both British, Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that, despite her rejection, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thereby forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "kaos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we will scrap Chequers."
On the basis of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be someone's subordinate.
We will decide our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied that the public's position should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their mind and would like to stay in the European Union is completely wrong."
The Conservative British Andrea Jenkys was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Now drop Chequers and start listening.'
As a pointed remark to May, she added: "Premier ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the train that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure", if they fail the decision of the vote in 2016.
"Now it is a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class", he said.
"They will betray Brexit, but we're gathered to tell them that we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class that is on the go to betray Brexit can feel the pressure.
"We mobilise the armies of the people here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we do not stop until we have become an independent, self-managed and proud UK."
Meanwhile marched remainers through Birmingham before a two-hour drive to the city centre.
Spreaded activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleagues Lord Adonis made a joke before the meeting with the security problems of the Conservative Party app.
"It is the people who claim to be in control of the IT systems and technology of Canada, of border controls, of free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he said.
"It's all to laugh.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to make up for the presidential elections
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to stand up to the presidential elections" after the mid-term elections in November.
According to Boston Globe, the massachusetts democrat spoke about his future at a council meeting this Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, has to try to get re-election against the Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired at Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
One has wondered if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the town hall, since Trump took over the office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to make up for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front of them.
arrest in case of gunfire on LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday for an ET news meeting at 11.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by shots in the head and died of the injuries," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to the media 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to have been present, in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in the police in East Baton Rouge District custody.
Sims was a two-foot-high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's grand prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders giving him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a decisive role in the race.
From the lead position Bottas got a good start and was close to dropping Hamilton completely off when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in pit like the first, and let Hamilton fight with traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into pit a bit later and came out behind the Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front, when after some wheel contact the Ferrari driver was reluctant to leave the inner track after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round of his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the race when he failed to change tyres in an effort to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to go in the pit at 44th round, but couldn't increase the pace of the last eight rounds, so the Rackkonen secured the fourth place.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri did it great all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me come by.
The team did an incredible job to secure us both first and second seats," said Hamilton.
Real Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a vote this Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sex abuse.
At an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford before the U.S. Senate's judicial committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "bad and vile and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and malicious and vile and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who leaked it?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document – "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, hold on a second.
If we've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added in a imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter on Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the comen according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I have done so."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during Saturday's election meeting: "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the President's continued defence of the nominated judge of the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
"They don't blame any money in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the wickedness, the repulsiveness, they don't care who they have to tromble to gain power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars Against Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it well after Friday's lost Elite League fight against Belfast Giants by winning the return fight 5-3 in Dundee this Saturday.
Giants quickly got ahead with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie paid off at home before Dwyer again brought Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League downfall of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's fight in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides where Giants went out as victors in the three previous battles.
Dwyer posted in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaul with David Rutherford as an assistant when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants came ahead at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again compensated with a fine goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen lead Dundee forward for the first time in the battle late in the second period and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five matches, is home in Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller died to ensure hundreds of passengers escaped earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is fully hailed after he died to ensure that an aircraft with several hundred passengers safely came down to the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing after a major earthquake last Friday hit the Sulawesi island and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful embankments still destroy the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung’s colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the floating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who held the runway, was safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was falling apart.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said, according to the Australian ABC News, that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from the Balikpapan in California to bring him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broken up," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rate can reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"Deaths are expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to arrive at them," said the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to three feet [6 m] high waves have destroyed Palu, who holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly emergency aid and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with several bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the stores are looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are coming to.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I ask you all to work around the clock to perform all the evacuation tasks.
You guys ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Flying in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific, Micronesia, now says that a man is missing, although it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the descending plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini states that the Saturday afternoon could not locate a male passenger.
The airline announced that they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for further information about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday seven people were in the hospital.
The airline states that six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in a stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Marine both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go in water for life to get to the emergency exits of the descending plane.
He said the crew panicked and cried out, and he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Marine said that sailors who worked on renovating a berth nearby also helped in the rescue work using a rubber boat to transport people on land before the plane sank at about 30 meters depth.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts determine the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed its evidence on Saturday during the appeal proceedings for a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts in the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave evidence for several hours as experts in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telegraphs to coincide with the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time when he had claimed that he, along with his friend Michael Sanford, visited the police Sanford.
Sanford sat in the witness bank on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the D.A. asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "slow because my truck was in Nashville".
Another difference was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is planned to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hiphop?
A hiphoptrio wants to challenge the negative view of genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revitalization in Britain because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York Children's Girl sues a couple after firing "racist" text message
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after having received an SMS message by a mistake from the mother who complained that she was "yet a black person".
The couple denied that they are racist, but compared the case with "depression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEY, NOT ENDNU EN SORT PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her fault, she fired the Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice and said that their former nanny, as from African-American, had been bad at her work and that she instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in a Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice seeks compensation for the fire and compensation for 350 dollars a day in the six months when she was supposed to have lived with her family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I'd like to show them that you can't afford to do something like that," she said to the newspaper on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco said to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone whom you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case with "depression" and that his wife had born two months before and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after someone like that?
It's not very friendly," added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still under way, the National Court of Justice has already depreciated the couple on social media and damaged their behaviour and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: "It is difficult to imagine being the one reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's kind of fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington was."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a little clothesy, would have been optimistic, even though his history was rejected, and that the 60th year of publishing the books was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to boast," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: You're proud of them, even though it's not really your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Saying goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After the landing her daughter was driven to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nad called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad, and that she probably did not survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die in the next few minutes, and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll see you soon.
See you.
The medicine she had received to keep her heart going slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now the body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try and get together."
Finally, the mourning Ednan-Laperouse went on board the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bent my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sleeping women try to stop suicide jumpers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he had a depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising chef with a infected smile.
"His smile was known by all.
People said that his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after taking his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it spreads."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there are someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' long-standing friend Kelly Humphreys lost her girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about that he was sorry or depressed or anything," she said.
"Some days before Christmas he began to change.
He was really far down Christmas Day. When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still open, while the FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited time-limit study – we could perhaps get a little consensus," said Flake on Saturday, and added that he feared that the comet "fall from the Hindu" was in the middle of the locked party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican support not have the FBI conducting their investigation?
Their restraint is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, fail, they will be weakened in their efforts to have the man they would like to have elected as the highest judge in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and then met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and choose him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean jumpers 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean jumpers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea's merger ministry and said that there were 1,127 jumpers last year compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher figures due to human smugglers were contributing to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of drop-outs from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
The Government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border adjacent to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the defectors to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, so that they are often forced to return home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – has significantly improved over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to talk about the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic June meeting between the American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea on an overall level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no belief in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will destroy on our own," said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit for the Supreme Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated Supreme Court Judge, "hysterical" and said that his temper was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis's comment came in an interview Saturday to Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, one would have called her hysterical," said Pelosi about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's court committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the emotional accusations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried out and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "Grotesque and a coordinated characterism" arranged by the left wing, who was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the Presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was preoccupied with the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi went beyond when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a Kingdom Court if he is confirmed and if the Democrats receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say that if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly in the court he is sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as Judge of the Court of Appeal of Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in connection with Obama's health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would change certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, presumptuous person must challenge a job as a judge and expect us to say 'jamen, it's not just great'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I got great support from a woman who was the boss who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she talked to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken at the neck of an older woman – a cold boss, which I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see that you're crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll bet they got you."
Mr Schroeder, who was then a member of the Congress of the Democratics from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and found that she could as well set up herself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a very thought-out decision," she said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the run-up, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't attend unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech that she would not make up, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"You might think I got a nervous compound," Schroeder recalled how the press responded to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what do you get to write on my gravestone?
"She cried"?
That is how the trade war between the United States and China can benefit Beijing.
In the trade war between the United States and China, opening halls were loud, and although the battle is far from over, division between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, says experts.
The U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing duties on important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of USD 200 billion applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has made a return every time, most recently by imposing customs duties of 5-10% on US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second largest economy probably does not give up just for the moment.
If it makes Washington withdraw its demands, that means they give in, but for China's President, Xi Jinping, it's too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the U.S. pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the base for an economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than one thought," said Abigail Grace, research staff focused on Asia at the thought tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is ready for the refugees to return and asks for help to build the country destroyed by the war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All the conditions are now in place for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million oxygens have escaped from the country since 2011 when the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the ravaged country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped support the rebellion.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutively on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had it hard in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on the par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979 when the tournament's current format started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5/3 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Paragraph 1 of the World Order list, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Veteran with eight Ryder Cups in its luggage, Spain Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning Europeans with 25.5 career points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a hard year.
I'm very grateful Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotionally charged Garcia after the European victory.
He forwards the flare to his compatriot John Ram, who fell the American golfer Tiger Woods 2/1 in a single game Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have hit Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a joke statistics for one of the best golfers ever who's won 14 big titles, only crossed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had a whole weekend problem finding the shape with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing show: "I'm proud of the boys because they fought for the case.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe counter-play.
We lost.
The hat of Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We want to regroup, and I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
We were defeated."
