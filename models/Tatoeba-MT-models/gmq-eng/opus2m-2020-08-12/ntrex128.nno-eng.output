Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently dismayed at a proposal to change the name of the Assembly member or AM to a member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction was due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be laughtered.
A Labour member said that his group is concerned about your 'MWP rhymar on Twp and Pwp'
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means silly and "pwp" beech.
A Plaid party member said that the group "is not naked" and has suggested an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an ‘open mind’ when it comes to the name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word ‘muppet’.
In this context, the Welsh letter w pronounced is not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, which now writes legislative proposals to introduce the change of name, said, "The final decision on which members of the National Assembly will of course be up to the members themselves."
A Welsh official decision of 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the proposed names, which showed great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of the National Assembly Members, the Delegation prefers the Welsh Member or the WMP, while the MWP elections received the most support during the public hearing.
National assembly members have apparently made other suggestions, but the struggle to become lonely has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, a main work. She will submit the bill in a few weeks.
The reform legislation contains other changes to the functioning of the delegation, including rules on the disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on their names when they debate the bill.
Macedonians voice in public dissent to change the name of the country
On Sunday the selectors shall voice over whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
People's dissatisfaction was decided to resolve a conflict that has occurred for many decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership requests to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the popular dissent about the change of name, said that he will look away from the result.
Those who support public opinion, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in names is simply the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin stagger as the church in Harlem, New York, struggles
'The old ones I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church in every corner,' said Adams.
‘Today none of the components are present.’
He said he understands why the bars disappear.
'People socialize in other ways now today,' he said.
‘Only people are no longer walking in the neighborhood that people visit normally.’
When it comes to the church, he is concerned that the money from selling the property is not going to last as long as the tenants believe, “and sooner or later they are back where they started.”
He added that churches can be replaced by unitary scholarships filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic places of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy unitary privileges in these buildings are white,” he said. “and this is the day when all the churches are connected, because it is not likely that these people who move into unitary privileges will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built of white socks before Harlem became a black town--Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin church for a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black sock that had preached in the vicinity, moved into the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black sock rented by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also rented the boikot of shopkeepers in 125th street, a chief officer in Harlem where the owners were opposed to sitting or promoting black.
The building suffered major damage in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson’s followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor of Saint Martin, was proud and called the bell game "The Clocks of the Poor."
The expert who played the watch game in July calls it something else: "One cultural tax" and "one historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first clock game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who allowed the church to play on the larger clock game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin could not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin in the last few months has become a complicated story about architects and builders, some of them added by the laymen of the church, and others by the episcopal bishop.
The sacristy, which is rented and made up of the clays of the laymen, wrote to the bispedom in July with concerns about the fact that the bispede ‘would ask the sacrist to pay,’ although the sacrist was not involved in the bispede’s addition of architects and building workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained about the lack of openness from the bispede.
13-year-old hai damage during hummardukt in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday as he dived after lobsters in California on the Saturday of the lobster season.
Attendance her just before 7:00 in the morning near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends in about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard that the gut cried for help. He paddling away to the gut with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the gutter was excited to have caught a lobster, before he realized that the gutter shouted 'somebody bit me!
Something bit me!'
'Heile his collarbone was torn off,' said Hammel that he observed when he reached the gut.
'I beg everyone to get out of the water: there is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The guy was picked up by air ambulance and taken to Rady Hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's not sure what kind of hai it was like undoing the guet.
In a press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added serious damage to the upper body to the gutter.
The authorities linked access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of shark in the region, but most of them are not likely to be dangerous.
Handeljeda Sainsbury's bets on beauty product
The UK Sainsbury's store chain shall compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenham's beauty product and offer supermarket services at the store.
As part of an investment in the United Kingdom's beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow while fashion and interiors are falling, Sainsbury's is going to test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more stores if it's a success.
Investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that led to being filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are empty.
Sainbury's said that they should double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer the trade mark Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They shall give L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand such as in Boots shops.
The store must also relaunch its own make-up line Boutique and make most of the products vegan, which should attract several young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop is going to test the floor of his perfumes in two of Sainsbury's shops, the first open in Croydon, London, last week, and the second open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and switching to buying small amounts of food every day from local retail stores means that large retail chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, the administrating tenant in Sainsbury's, has commented that shopkeepers will look more and more like a supermarket, while store chains are trying to fight against low-cost shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has merged with Argo's interior chain in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the food hall and so defended the purchase.
The store's previous attempt to renew beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots early in the 21st century, but this ended when the parties did not agree on how to share the profits from the pharmacy in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's selling pharmacy Celesio, which had 281 pharmacy and owned the pharmacy Lloyds, £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed the beauty sheaths will look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special skills to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that requires the old way to act.’
Peter Jones “roasting” after Holly Willoghby withdraws from agreement worth £11 million
The star of the Dragons Den TV program, Peter Jones, is "fast" after Holly Willoughby, the TV host, withdrew from an agreement with his world's world's lifestyle brand, £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote the interior and associated Truly.
The couple's cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark.
The host from this Morning, 37, made a newcomer on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the midst of the development of their new cooperation on a lifestyle brand to focus on his own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "fast" when the Golden Holly confessed during a strenuous meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of Jones's business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - mean that she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and associated Truly.
The collaboration has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was assumed to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of £111 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make sense that she shouldn't work with Truly, while Jones ran from Great Britain to enjoy herself in one of his holiday homes.
A source said, 'Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long - term plan for the future, and it would last many decades.
Her determination to withdraw has surprise all involved.
No one believed his own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for the hall.’
Experts believe that deciding on this Morning Host, which is one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions because of hard investments in the product, from cushions to candles to clothing and interiors, and can cause delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has our close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly along with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the board in March.
Para vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin who will host ITV's programme I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said yesterday evening, "We don't comment on his business."
Empty conversations “and then we fall in love”
He fooled about the criticism he was going to get from the media to come with a comment some might experience as 'upresidential' and to be so positive about the North Korean tenant.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his fool voice as "news Talker".
"I have not given up anything."
He commented that Kim was interested in a new meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June, as Trump called a major step towards the defeat of the nuclear weapons program in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea Ri Yong Ho to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday said that North Korea has not received a ‘equivalent response’ from the United States of America, in which North Korea’s early destruction occurs.
Instead, he added, continued the United States with sanctions to push North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
‘We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.’
He added that his work to improve the relationship with Kim has brought positive results--the end of rocket testing, help to release hostages and return the leases to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure when it comes to relations with Kim.
‘It’s so easy to be presidentic, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there,’ said Trump and pointed to the group that stood before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign relief organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants had to flee, no one declared the state of national crisis necessary for international emergency aid.
'Unfortunately, they have in many cases been very clear that they do not want international help, so it's a little challenging,' said Sumbung.
While the Redd Children put together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe if added with foreign passports are allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, president of the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that the authorities assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations for the law to provide emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is often designated as earthquakes, the country is not particularly adjudicated for the natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was at berth in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now on the way to Palu, but it will spend at least three days reaching the place of the new disaster.
President Widodo focused on the improvement of the infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential elections, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year there's a choice again.
President Joko is also under pressure when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have accepted his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets and used macheter, arrow and bow, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scared Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea by score in the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before he kicks him up and towards the goal.
The attempt sailed high above the penalty field and came towards the right top corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalag and into the goal.
'I was just trying to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq are trying to get as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,' said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kante came and dropped the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball.”
Chelsea lease 1-0 after the break after scoring in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazeard.
Before the goal, Hazeard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before he ran off the city near the midway and into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic took the ball fast on the midway.
So he shot it in a lovely way and let Hazeard into the penalty field.

The number of victims in Indonesia is increasing to 832
The number of victims in the Indonesia earthquake and the tsunami has increased to 832, reported the crisis agency in the country early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that coincided in the earthquake, like her on Friday and had a force of 7.5, followed by 6 meters of waves, reported the chairman of the emergency agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.
British police arrest man, 32, suspected of killing after the woman was stabbed to death
A killer researcher has started after a woman was found killed in Birkenhead, Merseyside today early.
The 44-year-old woman was found the knife stick at 07:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street, while a 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of killing.
The police have requested tips on the event from local residents.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The research is still in an early phase, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also urge everyone, including taxi drivers, who can pick up something on dashboard cameras, to contact us in case they have important information.’
A police officer has confirmed that a woman found is from Birkenhead, and that she was found in a world.
This afternoon, friends who think they know women have come to the area to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continued and the police have stated that they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get into his own apartment, but has been told by the police that no one is allowed to go in or out of the building.
He didn't know what to say when he found out what had happened.
The Bebuars have been told that they cannot enter their apartments in many hours.
A police officer said that the whole area is a place.
One woman came to be crying.
She says again and again "it's so terrible".

Parliamentary statue of Cromwell becomes the last victim of 'rewrite of history'
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England as his puritan followers did during the civil war in the 1600s.
But the Cromwell League portrayed Crick's proposal to remove the statue as "noise" and "one attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: ‘It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
Ikonoklasmen during the British Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's error would be the victim of his ancestor's actions, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public munitions in the 1800s, and is part of the history of a figure that many still think it is worth sweeping."
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, seen as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a topic of discussion in the historical debate.
What's certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the evolution of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of it apart.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.’
Mordargris attack and kill Chinese pawn
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southwestern China market, following local media reports.
The man, with his last name Yuan, was found dead, with cuta pulsary veins and covered with blood, near a pigbing on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig's nest is about to give pigs vaccines on a curtain on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the gate of one of the pig's pieces was open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilo of heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
'Right to my cousin was bloody and broken,' said the cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His corpse was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not listen to Yuan or his cousin.
The market student told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while the police gathered evidence of the scene.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although it is rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig went under arrest for a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and gave the man serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kilo of heavy pig held a Welsh farmer trapped between him and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News reported that pigs are not aggressive on average, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"They will only play.
They like to bite a little, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Residues of Hurricane Rosa brings rain to the southwest United States
As predicted in the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weaker over the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will be carrying a rainy rain to North Mexico and southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa had wind power up to 136 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 until 5:00 in the eastern time zone in the United States on Sunday, and the Hurricane Center was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is going to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure over the Pacific is moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity northwards to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimetres of rain can create dangerous flames and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will lead to rain of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the south-west United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain is expected in parts of the south-west United States; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous flames may occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It was warned against trips in the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn clefts into blazing rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation rates of more than 1 centimetres are possible, which can create small flames and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainy town for the season in the region.
Spreed tropical rain cities will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain increases late on Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic is getting colder, but tropical strokes will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and east United States is expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees and up from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the Northeast United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high chances of above average temperatures in the east-USA during the first half of October.
More than 20 million look at Brett Kavanaugh's ring
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw the testimony to Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and a woman who owed him sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political discussion on the subject continues, with interruptions in the regular television programmes of various broadcasters to reveal the latest news on Friday: a uniform reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the debt in the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she is 100% sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, under a strange question, that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the right hand on Friday, following Nielsen.
The company arrived at this number by finding the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Speaks were not clear from other channels that displayed the right side, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers from the office.
To put this in perspective, there's a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or Oscar distribution.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the canal was also the one with most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, said Nielsen.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
People are still interested after the hearing.
Flake was focused under the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate Republican, declared to be on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants cried for him on his way to a hearing with a judge's committee on Friday.
He stood and looked in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants ratted on him at CNN live.
'I stand right here before you,' said one woman.
‘Do you think he tells the truth to our country?’
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office has spoken out, and before he entered the lift he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The Broadcasting Bureau showed the hearing on TV when the judges' committee would voice for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh for full Senate and further voice.
But Flake said he could only do that if the FBI investigated the claims against Kavanaugh in the next week, something that the Democrats have also asked for.
Flake was partly over-spoken to talk to his friend, the Democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake took no decision.
Flake's decision turned out to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not voice for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May owes critics to play politics when it comes to Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, owes critics of her plans to leave the EU to ‘play politics’ with the future of the United Kingdom without regard for national interests, in an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to participate in the Conservative Party's conference on 29 September 2018.
In addition to the interview with May on the front of the Sunday Times, an interview is held with the former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who goes to the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the European Union to collect each other's fees is "absolutely absurd".
Wayde Sims Shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims Shooting
The police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting kor Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for deliberate killing, declaring the police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his spectacles during the fight.
The police found the spectacles at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, following a report from the WAFB channel, which is related to CBS.
After turning off Simpson, the police said that he admitted to have shot Wayde.
The guarantee for Simpson was set at $350 000, reports local visa The Advocate.
The coroner in east Baton Rouge published an early post-mortem report on Friday which showed that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police thank the Louisiana state police, their crime police, the Southern University police, and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The Alettic Director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thank the local police for being “wageful in obtaining justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter tall basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he score 5.6 points with 2.6 relapses per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is ‘unsatisfying’ after Wayde was killed.
'This is something we're always afraid of,' said Wade.
Volcano asks out ash over Mexico City
Popocatepetl volcano ash has reached southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The national crisis prevention centre asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity is increased in the crater and the centre registered 183 gas and oscene emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumblings and tremors.
Photos on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in various neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted an increase in volcanic activity, which is 72 kilometres south of the capital, since an earthquake with a force of 7,1 happened in central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
The police together with Catalan separatists within the Jubilee of self-esteem
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesting for self-esteem noises together with police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against self-esteem one year after the hearing about possible release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder paint that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The conspiracy also broke out later on the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalating.
For several hours, the separatists cried out, ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive, while the Protestants called out, ‘Long live Spain’.
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for small injuries after protests.
The mood is still pressed in the region and many will still have a year of independence after the 1st October hearing, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which became more common by separatists in Catalonia.
Most of the voters were voiced for self-determination, but there were also low selection rates among those who were against self-confidence and bigots.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the voice and the elective breakdown occurred in the region.
Groups that were too self-sustaining slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off the stack, but it had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests together with his wife, said that he no longer has the hope of self-sustaining in Catalonia.
“ Last year we experienced one of our best weeks.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to voice for themselves, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too self-sustaining to hold power this year, while many of their tenants are in exile or arrest while awaiting legal action for their role in the organisation of the National Strategy and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed protests in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been launched by politicians on both sides.
“The tension increases more and more,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan tenants who have been part of the pending legal proceedings since last year, declared that he would make elections in the European Parliament next year.
‘Praise as a candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn the backwardness of democratic values and oppression that we have experienced from the Spanish state,’ he said.

Menga shot gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston Sikrar says
Upset Livingston surprises the Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences their second say after 18 games that train for the Ibrox Club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot turned out to determine the difference while Gary Holt's side jammed with the Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no oversaver in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and shall play against the Hearts, as they lie eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers must host Rapid Vienna in Europe on Thursday.
Livingston has six victors in a row, and the main coach Holt has still not lost since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chance of losing track of the away team
Holt's team should have rented long before they were scora, and created several problems for the Rangers with the direct playing said.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low effort towards the goal, which made Alan Lithgow had to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decision-making goal was made in scora.
Rangers went on a frispark and Livingston made an open, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scora from the middle of the penalty field.
Before that, the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that home defense was solid and the keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forces Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Cares were sent back and forth in the Livingston Penalty field, while two punishments - after Halkett said challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were waved away.
'Fenomental 'from Livingston Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal struggle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses the curve upwards.
Their playing and playing style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks goes to Holt for the way he's jolted since he was trained.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, and organized a defense at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worralll throughout the struggle.
Rangers were unlike not motivated.
Even as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and only cut up the home half once, which should make Rangers realize they're no longer up.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The state camps in Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29, Berlin.
That's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- which is what's hoped to repair the relationships between the two NATO countries.
Countries have been indifferent when it comes to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police are preventing a crowd of over 25 000 from gathering over the musk because of "security causes," but many of Erdogan's supporters met up to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also met up to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state's determination to welcome him in the country.
The dulling Protestants reflected separatedly between German Turks, who view Erdogan as one hero, and others, who view him as an autocrat.

Roads have been routed and buses have to run around the area, while other motorists have been converted to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards uprising
Six prison guards have been injured in an uprising in a high-security prison for men, says the prison office in England.
The intruder broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special 'Tornodo' forces are collected to calm down the uprising, involving eight prisoners in a secluded section of the prison.
The guards have been treated for small injuries in the face.
One prison official said: ‘Special interest guards shall calm down the incessant uprising in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for damage.
We are not tolerating the power of our prison, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may be in prison any longer.»
There are over 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated for injury after a prisoner took action.
And last October, special forces had to come to prison to calm down a serious uprising, where prisoners throw billiards on the guards.
Rosa’s Orkanene threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flames (to the advantage of drought area)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it's just such a weather phenomenon that's heading towards Arizona early next week, in the rest of the hurricane Rosa pull south-west across the desert and creates fear of flame.
The National Weather Service has issued flaum warnings on Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona and South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and may give rain already late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix twitra that only ‘ten tropical cyclonars have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometres within Arizona limits.’
The latest models from the National Hurricane Centre report between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Moglon Rim area of Arizona.
It can be calculated between 2 and 5 centimetres in other areas of the south-west desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated totals up to 10 centimetres.
For areas outside the flammability risk, pink can be a sign of dryness.
Although flame is a serious concern, this probably will be a useful area in the south-west of the United States, which is exposed to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, extreme droughts in excess of 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest drought category, report weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is moving across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
With wind of over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters colder water in the Pacific and then enjoys itself down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
It's going to count a lot in parts of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flames.
‘A range of 7 to 15 centimetres is expected from Baja California to north-west Sonora, with a possible length of up to 25 centimetres,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the limit of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull forward through Arizona and into the south-Utah Tuesday evening.
‘The largest risk of Rosa or its residues is much rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora, and the American south-west desert,’ said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening flames in desert areas and landslides in mountain areas.
Attacks in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of killing after a 16-year-old found the stab in Somerset, England.
The teenager's gut was found damage in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night, reports Avon and somerset police.
The police have encouraged people who may have a mobile recording of what happened to them to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'slow' under 'sleak and angry' Democrats were against him
'One voice for the judges of Kavanaugh is a voice against the gracious and unimaginable tactics of the Democrats,' said the Trump under a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been ‘low’ under the ‘bad and angry’ democracys were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave testimony to the Congress on Thursday, and in an emotional way denied the debt of Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her sexually several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her debts during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
'One voice to the judges of Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most capable lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a faultless service in the public,' he said to a number of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to voice in the middle whales of the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't do, but I really do," he said.
‘That’s why I’m traveling around to fight for good candidates.’
Trump argued that the democrats are looking for “to resist and block”.
The first important voice in the Senate about the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to happen last Friday, said a Republican representative to CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, speaking on killed extras
At least 384 people are killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami frame the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to take part in a festival on the shores of the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters tall, struck the shores at sunset, and took many people while they destroyed everything they came over.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
‘When the tsunami was warned yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn’t go straight away and so became victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, President of the crisis relief agency in Indonesia GDPB, in Jakarta.
'As if the tsunami were not enough in itself, he pulled cars, three trunks, houses; he framed everything on the land,' said Nugroho, and added that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed up into three to avoid the tsunami and lived that way.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the crisis agency show many broken buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterquake continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes could be marked in the area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s technology testing and testing agency (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atom bomb over Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the Agency.
Nugroho blamed the damage as ‘wide’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found during the remainder of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and the size of destruction can be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Doggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Doggala, the communication is cut," said Nugroho.
“More than 300 000 people live there,” said the Red Cross, and added that their added and volunteering are on their way to the affected areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse,' said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticised on Saturday not to inform that a tsunami had slowed Palu, even though the authorities said the waves came within the period of notice.
An amateur video shared by social media shows a man on the top floor of a building that is desperate to cry out to people down the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hit the coast and brought buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video with the first one.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power failure and cut communications around Palu, which made it difficult for authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has started the process of submitting cargo aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reports the authorities, but refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened to receive emergency assistance, but will continue to be connected until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
They added World Vision from Donggala to the city of Palu, and have set up tents in the back of their office. On the way to the city passed the total destroyed areas, said Dosesba.
'They told me they saw a lot of broken houses,' he said.
It's very bad.
While the emergency agencies start their efforts to help those who have happened in the tsunami, some complain that foreign emergency workers with crisis management expertise have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign relief organisations and their associates cannot start work until Indonesia has declared that the area is a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
‘It is a crisis at provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the state says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,’ we can open to international emergency aid, but they have not yet updated the status.’
There's another evening in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those who are still missing hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday, a little guy was scared from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was afraid from the rest of a collapsed building, where she had doctors trapped next to the dead mother's for two days.
Gendon Subandino, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, claimed two of the missing paragliders of the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
One man called Mandagi said that one of the prisoners in the Roa Roa hotel was his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told me that he was desperate to send whatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one grey chin, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means the messages did not arrive," he said.
Twenty-stel $26 750 from minibank in Newport, Levee, USA
On Friday, thieves stole $26 750 from a worker in Brink's company in what he was about to fill up a mini bank in Newport, Levee, U.S.A., following a press release from the Newport police.
The worker had just emptied a mini bank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the worker was busy, 'a man broke up behind the worker' and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects while fleeing from the scene, following the press release, but the police were unable to determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If someone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapparen renames Ye
The Kanye West Rapper renames - to Ye.
He declared the change of name on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: “The library formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he escaped out in June.
The change of name came just before he was going to act on Saturday Night Live, where he's expected to drop his new album Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande's singer at the show after she cancelled because of 'emotional reasons,' said the program host.
In addition to being an acronym of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe the word "ye" is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye-- to reflect on the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are.’
Kanye is one of several famous rappers whose name has been changed.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names of Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West before, has also changed the style of writing to the name with and without a dash and upper case.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he “never will use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
On 2 October 1968 the military shot at peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and open several free universities.
He has said that the solution to work and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China is more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and the user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after different parts of the U.S. government argued about artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
'A doubling of the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, because all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,' said Lee.
A doubling of funding can double the chances that the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence is taking place in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book «AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order» this month via the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO (CEO) of the Sinovation Valves, who has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that beat the tallest ranked player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was President of Google in China.
Lee recognizes previous technology contests organised by the U.S. state, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked how much time the next competition should take, so that he can join and identify the next visionaries.
Scientists in the United States usually have to work hard to get government support, said Lee.
'It's not China that takes the academic tenants, it's the big companies,' said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have rented selected university students to work with artificial intelligence in the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen research into artificial intelligence.
‘I think doctoral students before artificial intelligence are given automatic residence permits,’ he said.
The Government of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Federation of Natural Science finances students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Science Association and other state organizations' way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Early this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a common centre of artificial intelligence, intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial Intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has been working on the proposals for national security and artificial intelligence for several months.
Macedonians voice in public dissent to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people cried on Sunday in a public dissent if they should change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia in order to resolve a several decades old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement on their territory, and has used veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of names could undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the peoples of Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that he is not going to be voiced in the referendums, and a boikot has sowed doubt as to how far the referendums will reach at least 50 percent of the people she needs to be valid.
The question on the public service seat is: ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership and alone in the agreement with Greece?’
The change of name support players, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of change in name is worth membership of the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved self-sustaining after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
'I am here today to voice for the future of this country, for the youth in Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for us all,' said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the hearing is not binding under the laws, a sufficient number of MEPs have said that they will follow the outcome of the hearing to make her decide.
In order for the change of name to take place, Parliament needs two thirds of the time.
The Political Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voiced, as opposed to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voiced.
'I hear about my children, we belong in Europe,' said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a selector in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dushko voiced in Strumika in the people's dissent in Macedonia to change their names and opens to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Mr Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of popular dissidents rather than Parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
‘We’re for NATO and the EU, but we’re not to change the name of our country,’ said Kavadarkov.
‘We are a poor country, but we have value.
If they do not want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that membership of NATO will attract investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 per cent of their workforce.
'I think the majority will voice for the change, of your 80 percent of our citizens will join the EU and NATO,' said Zaev after having the voice.
He said that a 'yes' result could be interpreted as a 'verifying our future'.
A measurement last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in public dissent — something below the required figure.
Another meaning measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to voice on Sunday.
Of these, the canal said that 70 percent would say yes.
In order for the public voice to be closed, at least 50 percent voice is required, plus one voice.
If public opinion is not closed, it may damage the policy of the left-wing government which took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense and scorar
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked Brighton defense which led to 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday in the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look laughterly light, when he played in 65 minutes.
The Argentine tip took a pass on the midway at the start of the sequence.
He fell past three Brighton defense players and reached open track.
Suddenly Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before he jumped past several others on the edge of the Brighton Penalty field.
He got past a passport on the left and found Sterling.
The English point used its first kick in the field of giving the ball back to Aguero, which used the right foot to beat Brighton-keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right into the right end of the goal.
'Aguero wear still with his feet,' said the City coach Pep Guardiola to reporter.
"We talked about that he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was scoring when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blues the first advantage of the Premier League fight.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero accepted the ball deep inside the Brighton Territory.
He kicks the ball beautifully along the left end of the path to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball while he hired Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue point kicks the ball into the goal just before he slipped out of the path.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies in American baseball
Nationals eliminated from the playoff content there was little reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has high competitive instincts, and hopes to take the 'mound' on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to 'playoff' for Rockies, who rents with one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least 5-2 against Nationals Friday night, but looks forward to locking the first division title.
‘Even if we don’t play for anything, it’s worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who doesn't want to play with such a relationship?'
It is still uncertain who will start in Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may have to pitch.
Scherzer, who will then start for the 34th time, throw a "bullen session" on Thursday and have "titche" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 ‘strikeouts’ in 220 2/3’ innings this season.
Trump collects selectors in West Virginia
The President referred in an obscene way to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the middle elections in the United States.
‘All we’ve done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not doing it, but I'm running everywhere to fight for the best candidates,' he said.
Trump continued, 'You can see this terrible, horrible group of democrats, you can see that it happens right now.
And they're convinced that they're definitely going to take back the power, you see how bad they are, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “respond and block”.
'And you can see it based on the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'slow and bad and ugly and dishonest.'
He referred to Senator and Democrat Diane Feinstein, who got his audience to bow.
‘ Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh no, I expect--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant to those who say what they mean
When the Momentum activists in my local party voiced to censor me, it was not surprising.
I'm the last in a series of Labour-MPs that's been told I'm not welcome - just to tell you what I mean.
My fellow Member in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for being disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of responsible economics, national security, Europe, and other similar issues that Jeremy ironically disagreed with former tenants about.
In the invitation for the meeting at Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said, "we want to meet to be inclusive and productive."
In the last eight years like Labour MP, Friday's meeting is just like that.
Unfortunately, today’s meeting was not like this, and the promise of ‘sniller’ policies has been forgotten longer, if at all they were followed.
It has become more and more clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that every meaning is judged by the tenants in the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a partialist, when colleagues I thought I would be politically alone with suddenly expecting me to change my mind and be alone in things I would never have told myself alone in - whether this was about national security or the internal market in the European Union.
When I talk to the public, it doesn't matter what I say, I always have a mouth on the social media, and people want me to go off while they criticize the centre policy and say I shouldn't be a Labour Party member.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get sex-discriminatory and racist harassment directed against themselves every day, and who are still professional and are not leaving.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normalized it has become to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone; for every mistrust proposal and for every change in the rules of the party, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I have received many advice in the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But it's not because I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I went to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry with thatcher and how the governments failed the country. My classroom was about to collapse, so I wanted better public services for those who need them most - whether it was as a local councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my political goals, nor in my previous choice.
No one in Nottingham East can have been in doubt about what I stand for and who of the current tenants I'm not alone with.
To those who spoke for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country is heading against a Brexit that will harm private, local and public services, I don't understand why people care about throwing away energy to ask questions about my loyalty to the Labour Partyier.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to top in Scottish rugby
Two seine 'tries' may change the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr continued to win in this very entertaining Tentent's Premiership game today.
They are now on top of the pallet as the only invincible layer of ten.
It was their sovereign defenses and the ability to take chances that gave their home team and coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be naked.
"We've been tested in the last few games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be naked," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr fortress rose, they were better than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a “try” for 14 minutes, where Frazier Clemo tried a “conversion,” like Putting Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland-Captain Rory Hughes from Warriors let Melrose gather, and Jason Baggot took a “unconverted house”.
Climo got a sentence right before the break, he scora and converted a solo tr to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's 'try,' which was 'converted' by Baggot, reduced the slingling net by five points.
There was a long break when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and placed on the stretcher, and from the restart Ayr went forward through a “try” from Stafford McDowall, which Clemo “converted”.
The working captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got a yellow card, and again Melrose tried an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball from the sentence statement, Scora MacPherson en “try”.
Climo 'converted' again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's 'box kick' and sent Gregor Henry away from his home team his fifth 'try'.
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in conjunction with the party Greg Hemphyll.
The Duo has announced that the coming ninth season is going to be the last one, and it seems Kiernan plans his life after Craiglang.
In accordance with official lists, he is director of the Amfigmorn Limited.
The player will not comment on the matter, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper suggests that Kiernan would be involved in the ‘future restaurant industry’ in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia hopes the right will open the watercourse to the Pacific
Sailors patrol marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from the Lake Titicaca to Amazonaself are covered with the motto: 'The sea is ours.
and the obligation to return to it.’;»
In landlocked Bolivia, people can still remember a coastline the country loses to Chile, in a bloody conflict about resources in the 1800s.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades, while Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice to come on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has driven, calm and is alone, and, of course, expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the judgment of the International Court of Justice, in the hope that the Court of Hague will support Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiation - will give Bolivia an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who is struggling to be elected again next year, has good reason to hope for a positive result.
“No we will soon return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts don't think the court will allow Bolivia to access the sea - and that little would have changed even if they had access.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Court of Justice does not have the power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has pointed out that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the Court comes only six months after the last negotiations indicates that the case ‘was not complicated,’ said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In the last four years, far from the Bolivian case, they have done the opposite.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,’ said Zárate.
Morales, with his contentious rhetoric, has killed what was to be of Chile's goodwill, meant Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the following issue.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that his decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given ‘an extraordinary opportunity to open new relationships with Chile’ and a chance to ‘stick at 139 years of indifference and benefit both,’ he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win voices.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right to access to the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The judgment is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past.’
North Korea says they won't dispose of nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to abolish, unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on the lifting they gave during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean tenants.
Ri's comments come at a time when the United States' foreign minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to start over its locked nuclear diploma, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean tenant, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will be in subjection if the United States persists in sanctioning and contradicts any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to agree to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang removing first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a new meeting.
However, many are critical of Pyongyang’s seriousness when it comes to decommissioning and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plan to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headbands are the last fashion on the way to a handrail near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you don't need to search anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a series of large and special headpieces in their SS19 collection.
Most unractic hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was an eloquent, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, at the brim that covers the models' heads.
There was also other over-dimensioned belongings during the fashion show, including a jewel-pryda vassmelon, a wizard's hat, and even an pineapple--but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks--just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations is like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can just enjoy it.
Mothe experts track that the huge hats come for the hall in a hand-held near you.
The oversized hats come right after the 'La Bomba', the straw hat with the 60 centimetres wide breast that has been seen on Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highest unractic hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk--a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-clothed model that carried her.
Beach bag, with a colour of burnt orange and frozen tops with a white skin handle, was the most eye-catching part of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection during the fashionka in Paris.
Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the fashion shops next summer – the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private bullets in Scotland are known to be at high academic level, and this continued in 2018 with marked examination results, which are only enhanced by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other social activities.
With more than 30,000 e-mails all over Scotland, these bullets, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Sclerosis (SCIS), work to offer the best services to the students and their parents.
The aim is to prepare their students for further and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see modern languages are popular election subjects in the spheres.
Nelson Mandela said, 'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot only fall into English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the results of the exams from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables, with the highest character of self-discretion.
A.
Dataa, which was collected from SCIS's 74 memberships, shows that 72 percent of the students got A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also got A.
This shows that independent chess in Scotland supports the semantic language as vital features, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages considered equivalent to STEM discipline (science, technology, engineering studios and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent chess and other places.
A survey carried out by the British Selection for Addition and Properties in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers strove to fill the settings due to lack of language skills in the applicants.
For this reason, language is increasingly important in order to prepare young people for working life.
With several skills for language teachers, these properties are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what kind of career a youth, if they've learned a second language, they have a real advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov investigation of more than 4000 grown-ups in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any other language than English well enough to hold a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a tosifra percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
The ability of several languages, especially those used in developing countries, can give children a better chance to find good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to the language in which they teach.
Many chess focuses on the classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the United Kingdom when we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in a unique sense, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish self-discipline is dedicated and wants to create a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the properties they need to be closed, no matter what happens in the future.
One cannot deny that in this global business-oriented environment, languages are vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called ‘international communication features’.
Self-discipline will continue to offer this choice, thus offering diversity and high competence for Scotland’s young people.
Il faut bien le fiaire.

LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Ventetida will soon be faced with fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut on the basketball team Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the presesong game on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he should play, has not been determined yet.
“It’s going to be more than a minute and less than 49,” announced Walt on Lakers’ official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweet that James most likely will play a limited amount of time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the first season.
'I don't need any foreplay at this stage of my career to get ready,' he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts on a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned stops the coming week, including stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote waiting to choose to fill the Supreme Court's vacant position, Trump aims to build support for upcoming mid-term elections as Republicanans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting is due in November.
How long should Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trumps collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump si West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably address this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about debts of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmatory voice from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this cave of collections is to help Republicans meet the November elections and get some momentum.
So President Trump's campaign says that these five collections next week are aimed at "absorbing volunteers and fans that the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives", following Reuters.
‘Control of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will raise as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season,’ reports a spokesperson of the Trump campaign who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection to evening can bring support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and subtract coverage from Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is requested in the estimations.
'It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a lift in the meaning measurements,' said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, following Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the stomach for battle to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions Saturday afternoons foursomes could only be like this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sport attack, but one that players really believe in, and never more than on competitions like these.
So where would they say that moment is now?
'They had a six-point rental, and now there's four, so we take it as a little moment, I guess,' said Jordan Spieth as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points leading to twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to invert, not least shape to Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has our mortals from tea to green and rents for examples.
The guttural screams of the celebrations were higher when his round continued, sinking an important putt to take the match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt that won the battle of 15, was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you that he thinks the American team is not out of this.
'You've really just got to dig deep and worry about your own fight,' said Spieh.
There are all these players left.
18 holes for creating an emblem.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but cute couples are four from four and can't do anything wrong.
"Molwood" was the only couple who weren't going to shoot a bowey on Saturday afternoon, but they also missed the boweys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a track with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to float both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, states that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and it would not be more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talking about European honor will be too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bowey and two doubles on the first nine, rough spanjolen and Swedish into a hole they never got in the vicinity of climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give, and the way that a strategy can change in an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant rental into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that anyone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 rents in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-balls and foursome games with a 10-6 camp over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari rented the charge with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to take their fight so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side let the bod to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfired American side tomorrow fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in foursomes and won two battles, but they couldn't get in the undercut.
Jim Furyk's page needs eight points from the 12 single fights on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Moliwood" after an intriguing weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from their open score in four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they went so great out to beat one outcast Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with one more after the 5 and 4.
Woods, who snuck through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliants, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who slept for morning fourballs, returned to the parties Henrik Stenson in foursomes for a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not even get everything they wanted on a nice, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three times the size of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas win the reference to the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 say over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the open.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a layer come back from a four-point layer and entered single, even though as holders, Fury's page only needs to draw to keep the trophy.
Having been the second best for two days, it still seems that a Sunday counterattack will be outside of them.
North Korea says it's not going to rust down unilaterally with no trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that if sanctions continue, the mistrust of the United States will be increased, and that the country in no way would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told at the annual General Assembly of the World Government that North Korea had made “significant measures” to improve conditions in the last year, for example they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and did not promise to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
'We still don't get anything corresponding back from the United States,' he said.
‘Without confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first.’
While Ri, a known North Korean, has made several complaints over Washington's resistance to a 'phase' approach to the demise of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be rewarded to take gradual steps, his statements showed considerable importance by not rejecting unilateral nuclear degradation, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement printed by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever since between a sitting U.S. President and a North Korean tenant in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for the ‘degradation of nuclear power on the Korean peninsula’ while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean War since 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed talks to facilitate the imposition of international sanctions in North Korea.
‘The United States insists on ‘degradation of nuclear power first’ and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose of coercion, and they even resisted the ‘Declaration to End Peace’, said Ri.
‘The belief that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is, when sanctions continue, our distrust is only getting bigger.’
Nothing about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the American president highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister weighed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added: "If the party in this call for the destruction of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the degradation on the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the General Assembly in F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the U.S. mainland, after the evil president Trump called Kim a rocketman on suicide.
Trump, who last year threatened to 'totally destroy' North Korea, ausa rose above Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work had to be done and that the penalties had to remain in place for North Korea to complete its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timeframe for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the U.S. State Secretary, Mike Pompeo, told F.N. his insurance council on Thursday that, ‘The sanctions to the Security Council must still be firmly maintained and without failing until we get the complete, final, verified closure of nuclear weapons.’
The Board of Insurance has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to involve the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the General Assembly in F.N. and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemns him to come with "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile city and also a nuclear complex if the United States did “equivalent actions”.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'equivalent measures' he applied, were insurance guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University has this year helped all students to get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture that's going to study in caffeine all night. It means that one uses caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
One academic found that top university students are often careless when it comes to the very most basic - how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his battles in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep failure on learning.
‘At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I told this now, at the age of growing?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping--which surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athleteic performance, and improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the health services of the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students got seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hour course contains a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athleteal performance is affected by sleep shortages, as well as how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses, with interactive icons, requires participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it won't change the behavior of elevar immediately.'
But we think they have the right to know-- just as you have the right to know, the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, let Prof. Czeisler to.
He said that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleeplessness is a growing problem.
To ensure that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid going up in weight, since sleep shortages put the brain in starvation mode and make them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after having our students with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eye and inspired him to press to get a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler advised that the students should consider setting up an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic displays and LED lights, which can change the overall time of the day, resulting in problems of sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets give Gernards men down
Rangers went on a new defeat on the off track when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's unveiled side to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take its first speaker off the track since 4-1-triumfen on St Johnstone in February, but made to Gary Holt only cause Gerrond's second defeat on 18 games as a leader, and gave eight points, one round under Ladbroke's rental of the Premier League, Hearts.
There were seven minutes before half time, and a Ranger statement with a lack of inspiration never seemed to look like it was.
While the Rangers now fall down to the sixth place, the Livingston climbs to the third and is only behind the Hibernian on target.
And there may be additional problems in the Rangers stock after the Liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an object was apparently thrown away.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that shy Ayr into Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt , however, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a drip shot last week, and he would have been excited about the way that the plunger of his suit took the rivet of his opponents at every turn.
Rangers might have had the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have played after just two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midway player failed in his giant jinn.
A long frispark from Keaghan Jacobs found so Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense party, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the retreat.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than believe in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morello's acquaintance decided that he would have been punished at 20 meters when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but he condemns Steven Thomson to turn away the wish of the Colombian.
Rangers were only able two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's headar and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules of play, nobody can deny that they did so only because of the "shot".
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep deathball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher struck the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard gave the break as if he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and replaced cause an immediate effect when the wing player created a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly raced forward to block.
But Livingstone continues to list the guest team to play exactly what game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending forward long shoots in long shoots.
Holt's team could have increased the rental said at the end, but McGregor was happy to prevent Jacobs from it, until Lithgrow had a long article from the corner mark.
The reserve for Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim for punishment when he supported along with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanac: Inventor of Geigerter
And now a page from our "Sunny Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and we REKN ... the day when he was to become the physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus known as Geiger counter.
As a scientific carrier beam all the way back then, the Geiger counter was also a carrier beam in pop culture, as in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' movie, with the seemingly unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What on earth is it?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter; it can be used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that result from the radioactivity of the minerals.»
Evans: “Yes, no boblar it!”
«Hans» Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that asks his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune system to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune system to "see" red cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory

A sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, felt that the ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “run the growth of multiple types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extract immune cells from patients and ‘teaching’ them how they target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West starts a Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing a MAGA-lue, after visiting the TV show Saturday Night Live.
Sorry, that didn't work out very well.
Kanye West was out in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance where he praised the United States president Donald Trump, and said he wanted to stand still for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a tirad and repeated support say to Trump.
"So many times I speak to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number together with editor Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fools of Brett Kavanaugh his testimony in the Senate's court order about the debt of Christine Blasey Ford's sexual abuse.
Although it was not sent, the recording to West's tidade was uploaded to social media by chorus Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the post.
The West had also complained to the audience that he had the difficult backstage because of his main garment.
‘They bullied me behind the scene.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunk place," he said, according to Washington's Examinor.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sunk place?" said he would "take on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.’
His comments led to annoyance at least twice from the audience, and the SNL cast members seem embarrassingly concerned, Variety reported, with one person who told the publication: "The studio was dead."
West was brought in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confuse many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner as a twittra: “To one of the most courageous spirits: TAKE TO THINK UP WITH THE POWDER.”
But talkshow-hosted Karen Hunter twittra that West "maybe only was as he is and it's absolutely amazing."
‘But I did NOT choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) who I believe embraces and asks out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
And so are we?" she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now ‘formally known as Kanye West’.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last music doctor Prince, changing the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the swinging role of Jon Snow in HBO's chosen medieval fantasic series Game of Thrones.
But the code player, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often lead young guys to feel that they must be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks something has gone wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo-age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-player Rose Leslie, including 31, admitted that he knows "very strong" to address the problem.
"Personally, I am convinced that something has gone wrong with masculinity." he said.
‘What have we learned men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?’
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to very human characteristics.
He goes on to say, 'What is innate and what is learned?'
What's learned on television and in the streets, what makes young guys feel like they have to be this special side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time-- how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not do the Game of Thrones for the end of the series this summer, saying he is ‘completed with battlefields and horses’.
From November, Kit will play in a new recording by Sam Shepards True West, who is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he was watching the meeting with the wife's Rose to be the best thing that came out of the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life further,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the cut-out to Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are framed in the country, saying health is added.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transferred through six, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a consequence of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who got HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero,” said Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQs is claimed to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, students have counted that 70-90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are derived from inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has guaranteed universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add the lax information from the GOP-senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
The U.S. Rep. Maxine Waers condemned Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had disclosed personal information about three Republican American senators on the Wikipedia pages to the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democracy claimed that the claims were pedaled by extreme right-wing surveys and web pages.
"Laughs, lies and more contemptible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill under a Senate panel saying louding about the debt of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the articles was linked to Waters 'offices and released the information to a member of the Waters' staff, Hill reported.
‘This groundless claim is completely false and an absolute lie,’ continues the Waters.
‘One of my added - who has been given his identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these ureics and false claims - was by no means responsible for the leakage of this information.
This groundless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.’
The statements to Water quickly got criticism on the web, among other things from former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” wrote Fleischer.
‘This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone gets blamed for something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They must not be tough.
They must not ask questions about the motives of the debtor.
They must be peaceful and peaceful.'
Fleischer turned out to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the democrats of the judges of Kavanaugh, who were owed by critics to be seemingly angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take over Water's place in the middle selection, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big if true", he tweeted.
In the statement, Waters said that her office had notified ‘the right government and the law enforcement units of these false claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed,” she continues, “and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for each of my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again - spy duty by weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit values in all new films with a British angle, and it works for this revitalisation of Johnny England's action-comedy spoof-franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire that deals with how openbert we are become the new export power of the country?
In any case, the great, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has for the second time been allowed to renew his permission to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide-ranging composer of cinemaviters in non-English-language countries.
He is, of course, the stupid, secret agent who's broken in his bizarre desire to spread a little glamour has got a little bit by Clouseau, a date by Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple tune to the firecars, theme under the Olympic opening ceremony in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the edifying and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, which left chaos afterwards.
There are one or two fine moments in this last JE excursion.
I love Johnny English who approaches a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armoring suit while the rotor blades beat his helmet.
The gift of Atkinson to physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor feels quite dull and strangely redundant, especially since “serious” film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedie as an ingredient.
The mood feels like he's aimed at children instead of being grown up, and to me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as the Atkinson's claws in the person in Bean.
The current permanent situation is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the U.K.'s super-secret web-network of spies, which exposes the identities of all agents in the area, to the dismay of the agent at work - a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who's a pompous and war army figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political unopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Thesa-May character, but there's not much in the script to work with.
Her informers inform her that once every active spy has been owed, she must bring in someone who has been retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English self, who works as a teacher by some elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons about how to work undercover: a few fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type Academy for spying.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a emergency briefing and reforestation with its former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving over to a submarine job, an overwhelming role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to be awfully mad in her Majesty's Secret Tenester is back to full in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the enchantment of the charismatic technology of the billionaire, who claims that he can solve the United Kingdom data problem: the scary Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin constructing their farce-like game: disguised as waiters, putting those guys at a nice French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves on board Volta's yacht; and English triggers clean anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself known to the inner of Volta's house.
Everyone stopped is probably pulled out to the last sequence, but as loveworthy and uncisiplined as it is, there is quite a lot of baby TV all over the place.
Pretty moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talents?
Labour Party Labour denies that they are working on a plan for English workers to work for a four-day week, but they are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work for a four-day week - but is paid for five.
According to the report, the party will send further savings made by artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an additional day off.
Then would add could enjoy a three-day weekend--but still get the same pay.
Sources said that the idea would "pass" with the economic agenda of the party and plans to increase the benefits for workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be advertised before the turn of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a desire that fits into the approach of the party to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as subordination to the party's industrial strategy.'
The working party would not be the first to acknowledge such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its election campaign in 2017.
However, the ambition is currently not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesperson said, 'A four-day work week is not a party policy and it is not assessed by the party.'
Shaders John McDonnell used the previous week's work conference to enhance his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'unintentional directors' and 'professors' in rich businesses.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders in water operations cannot get back their entire effort when a Government of Employment could do “deduct” because of perceived misguided behaviour.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate governance and create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including equity funds) to provide 10 per cent of the equity capital of private sector enterprises for added funds, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, about $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, informs in the '60 Minutes' television program about the FBI's in the investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their mindsets
The FBI investigation into complaints against Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question as to to what extent the Agency could influence some Republican senators to draw support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in '60 Minutes' the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change.
Kennedy seems more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
'I mean, of course,' said Kennedy.
‘I was on my way into the ring, I said, I have spoken to the judges of Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, firm, unwitting.'
Graham's voice seemed to have been seen in stone.
'I have settled my complaint about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite complaint to change me,' he said.
'Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it strongly, 'la Graham to, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
'And all of its names could not verify it.
It's 36 years.
I can't see a new one.'
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosted by the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a hugely impressive layout of stars acting and an equally impressive mission; end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's big lawn, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes appear, but also to increase consciously for the true goal of the event of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concerters had to complete a number of tasks, or ‘actions’ as voluntary work; send e-mail to a world-class, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful does the Global Citizen have 12 years left to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" -- people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it has registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, and participated in and pressured on a number of different goals.
It states that these actions have contributed to world leaders being able to announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements that follow their actions, including at least $10 billion that have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the security funds up to now have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people all over the world.
Some of the most important obligations are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based party partnership of investors and implementors who are obliged to ‘help children reach their full potential’; promises to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
‘With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,’ told the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after they had taken more than 5,000 actions to demand that the United Kingdom improves nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the website, they ask, ‘What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?’
Global citizen replied: "There will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the big civil rights and the anti-apartheid pipes leading us, we're going to jump, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors who are acting on this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the fleet as a block to prevent Russian energy exports - internal secretary
Washington may ‘if necessary’ refer to its fleet in order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, have international secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiners.
Zinc claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
‘I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is that they want to convey energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,’ he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
‘The United States has this opportunity, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that their energy is not on the market,’ he said.
Zinc spoke to participants on the event arranged by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group presenting itself as ‘voting to the energy user’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
‘The economic solution in Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,’ he said, while referring to Russia as a ‘one-trick pony’ with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
The statements come from the Trump administration to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, officials in the Trump Administration, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, try to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘unsuitable’ Nord Stream 2 tube project, which followed Trump made Berlin the ‘capture’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline lease, which is designed to double the existing pipeline lease capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's eager opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons, and is a example of unfair competition.
‘I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,’ said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. detention has withdrawn from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has encouraged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
‘I have a major problem when a third country disrupts our energy supply,’ said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “fastly run” to serve as a presidential candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she wanted to take a ‘reasonable look’ to be a presidential candidate after the mid-term elections.
During a Council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider being a candidate.
‘It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman at the top,’ said she according to The Hill.
‘By 6 November, I will carefully consider serving as a presidential candidate.’
Warren entered President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said that he “leads this country in the wrong direction.”
'I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy,' said the Ho.
Warren has been broken in his criticism by Trump and his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, an opinion poll issued on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should be a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the "probable" Massachusetts Selectors said that the senator should not be a candidate, following the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe investigation.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidate.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump Collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being served in September.
He was arrested and charged with a power event in the world on Monday night
'What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other families who are covered by PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with,' she said to the audience at a collection for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elf in the room” and said about his son and other war veterans that “they come back a little changed, they come back here, they come back and wonder if the respect for what they and the co-sol data and pilots and all the other military have done for the country exists”.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was guilty of physical authority in the world against a woman, for having disturbed a report about the power of the world and the storage of a weapon while he was the Russian, following Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries, D.C. Support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen Columbian states and districts support a legal challenge to a new American policy that denies asylum for victims who flee from popular or international authority.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts submitted a friend-of-the-fly Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker demanding policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions is suitable for the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) archived in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her party 'and the elective regent sons' abused her, but the U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for American asylum, as nations face massive problems with gangs and power in the world.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration laws, which allowed illegal immigrants who fled from the power of the world to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Minister of Justice Karl Racine said in a speech on Friday that the new policy “is ignoring many decades of state, federal and international law.”
‘Federal law requires all asylum cases to be condemned for the special facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle is contrary to this principle,’ said the friend-of-court briefly.
Lawyers further claimed in the summary that the policy of denying immigrant access harms the US economy, and says that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and ‘provide the necessary work’.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigrant judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of refugee abuse and gangage in June.
'Asyl is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political meaning,' said the Sessions of the 11th of June in their policy announcement.
Asyl was never meant to alleviate all the problems--even all the serious problems-- that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu, while the death figures are dubbed in the race to find survival
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly serious.
“It feels very tense,” said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who tired of his feverish babyson at an evacuation centre in the broken city of Palu.
«Every minute ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is difficult to find.’
Residents are observed on their way back to their broken worlds, searching through water-damaged property parts and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals that were destroyed by the earthquake, which had a force of 7.5, were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken their backs and shoulders, rested outside the Palu's Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to still strong sequel.
Tears filled his eye while he told him that he knew the powerful earthquake shaking the hotel room he shared with his wife and the daughter on the fifth floor.
‘It was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think, 'said Haris to the Associated Press, and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe.»
US Ambassador owes China for "Mobbing" with "Propaganda Ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper conducted a 4-page advertisement in an American newspaper and highlighted the mutual benefits of trading with the United States and China, the American ambassador against China Beijing owed the US ambassador to use the U.S. pressure to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid contribution in Des Moines registry--the state of Iowa's greatest salsavis--after having owed China to try to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, a debt China denied for.
Trump's debt that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections, marked what American servicemen told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign of Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign government to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in turn increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's return tariffs early in the trade war were designed to match exporters in states such as Iowa supporting the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador of China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
“China”, wrote Branstad in a section of Sunday’s Des Moines register, “double no bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
‘In the distribution of propaganda, the Chinese government uses America’s dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by adding a paid ad to the Des Moines register,’ wrote Branstad.
‘In contrast, at the aviskiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited diverging voices and will not see any true reflection of the different measurements that the Chinese people may have on China’s problematic economic path, given that the media is below the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party ‘ forces him.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers turned off the request to publish" his article, even though he didn't say which one.
Republicans denouncing female electors leading the midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warning analysts.
As many top republicans are stand-by and defend the Supreme Court-elected Brett Kavanaugh in meetings with several debts of sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a relapse, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-way elections.
The facts about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on the record that they already wanted to move forward with one voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last eyelash pressure for an FBI investigation would be enough to entertain angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC-Avisia.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang 'November is coming!' while they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who rule the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination is broken in the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
‘Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the diagram,’ said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partial political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it already has our height, that's true.
But there may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailedly stated the claims of sexual abuse directed at the appointed Supreme Court, analytics suggested that a relapse could follow some Republicans pushing forward with confirmation.
'This has become a confused root for the GOP,' said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early in the previous week, following NBC News.
‘It’s not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,’ Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that is involved in selecting Democrats, pointing to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little bit divided over who they're going to believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little bit more sidings with the latter.
A new meaning measurement from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, and besides at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Committee of the Rules of Law to the Senate during the last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Courtnominated her sex organs while attending a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a start-up that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology doctor, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to select where data is stored and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee speculated that the measure of Inrupt is ‘world domination’.
"We have to do it now," he said in the beginning.
‘It is a historical moment’.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online repository" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, memory lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a web browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal online store is that it's all up to the user who can access any kind of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authority through data’.
The idea of Inrupt, followed by the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some contracted developers to work with the project, as well as a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create dedicated decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned upside down over the night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In an article on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network collection built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet as he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine Feira
The godheads of the only British church who won a Victorian cross during the first world war as a fighter have been more in their hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was still killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial was the deed of his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his children, Michael Vann, said that it was "brillant symbolic", that the stone would be deducted just 100 years after his grandfather's award winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col won the battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, “through a very thick shoe and under heavy fire from the field and machine gun.”
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "greatest galanti" led the line forward before he alone rushed forward with a field gun and knocked out three of the group.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918--a little over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were, "Something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm humble for."
He and his brother Dr. James won also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was very honored to play a role in the parade, and added that “the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people.”
The MMA fans were up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a package of Bellator 206 but you won't be able to see the main event.
The San Jose account contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in Great Britain on channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just in the Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald premeditated to meet each other, U.K. viewers were drugged again when the coverages changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter crop byte for the comic book of the children as " sort of a sick joke."
‘It’s public regulation that at 6 o’clock if the inside was not owned this way, they had to switch to the program for the children,’ said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when he was asked for the transfer.
‘ Peppa piglets, ‘yes’.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they should work with planning to include British viewers in the future.
'I think that when I think about replay, I think we can probably figure it out,' said Coker.
‘But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we can’t find out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it went over, there were many texts that went back and forth, and everyone was not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five games instead of six -- as we usually do -- and we tried to hand over to the fans, and we just walked over.
It is an unfortunate situation.»
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew “underlying” because of sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says that he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality--but he gave it the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to the next school that "not all of them are like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking out about homophile's rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said to be a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The permanent reporter in the long run showa, Kirsty Young, has taken free several months because of illness.
What could look like a missing in Laverne's first program, Daly said he knew "less than" all the others who grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like guys and girls."
He said, "Untoday, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different is the real things that have given me the power and the strength to cheer up."
He wanted to prove that he was "whatever," he said, so that he did not disappoint all when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-gauge bronze Olympic medallioner has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance at the Commonwealth Games of Australia this year to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was talking out because he felt lucky that could live open without any confusion and wanted to give other 'hops'.
The three-song world champion said that falling in love with a man -- the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "surprising me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
'When you go through so much at such a young age'--he went to his first OL-en his 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and downturns.
The couple were parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole "his" perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything about I need to win a gold medal," he said.
‘You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Mi Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had tickets to London in 2012--when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that you're not going to be in the front row," he said.
'I held on when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincible,' he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had been dreaming about all my life--to dive in front of a home audience in an Olympic game, where fans didn't feel better," he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs--Pride of Heather Small--who had vibrated with him in the structure of the Olympics and gave him still goose-skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday time 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Ryder Cup-match, but he has to turn around saying to avoid that it's an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was seen on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, which he has often been for the United States, split the five times the winner's day between being a cheerleader and working with his game within reach of the hope of correcting what's bothering him.
Never most competent long shot. Not even at the top of their career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting the long shot on the tangle, the French main course, where balls hit outside if the golf player isn't exactly with the punch.
And if the course itself isn't daunting enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game on Sunday, the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has merged with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their battles this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single fights, get to a warm start, the Mickelson's struggle can be completely decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
'He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a clapping on his back and laid his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,' said Furyk.
‘He has great confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two games.
I saw for me more, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He'll be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fallo's record in most Ryder Cup games that will be played on Sunday.
This can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses, and seven halves, even though Furyk said that his proximity brought some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to keep fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the teamroom," he explained.
'I think the younger players had fun that got a round with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
It contributes much more than just playing.’
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that major rentals can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a substantial rental on the way into the last days' singles of Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant trip.
Danish made its debut in the 1997 struggle at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only crossed the finish line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, wins 141⁄2-131⁄2.
'You kept reminding yourself that we had a big rental on Valderrama; we had a big rental on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,' said Bjørn, after he had seen the Class 2018 winnings 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
You go to full open tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have a score on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've always said, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side - the biggest players in the world.»
Happy about how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: "I would never take the speaker in advance.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow, there's the individual performances that come out, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you're going to be testing full of your capacity as a golf player.
That's the message you need to mediate to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself too."
In contrast to Bjørn, contrary to the number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Fury himself has been at both ends of the spin operation in the last few days, after being a part of the winning team in Brookline before he ends as a loser when Europe withdrew from the 'Miracle in Medinah'.
'I think every fucking word of it,' he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, had gathered his players on the way into the last day.
‘We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start that you saw on Brookline, which you saw on Medinah.
When the moment goes one way, much pressure is put on the middle battles.
We set up our line-up correspondingly and put the gut on in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow'.
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to rent the game and meeting Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
'I went with this group of guys in this order because I believe it covers all the way through,' said Bjorn about his choice of singles.
Germany’s new warship appointed once more
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been ordered in 2014 to replace elderly warships from the cold wartime, but it will not be there until at least next year due to incorrect system and shaky costs, reported local media.
The launch of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the rental ship of the split new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fregantane, has now been appointed to the first half of 2019, following Die Zeit-advisa, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems following the delivery of the plaguing fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships the Navy ordered back in 2007 will replace the elderly Bremen-class frigatets.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-planes and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to outsource the latest freegatets for up to two years away from the ports at home.
Nevertheless, continuous delay means that the groundbreaking warships, which certainly allow Germany to exercise foreign power, will already be out of date when they enter service, note Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware errors" which made the warship useless if they were placed on a battle task.
Software errors were particularly important when the command of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the labour force on older Bremen companies.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces performance and limits the fleet's ability to add to future upgrades.
The 7000-ton ‘Rheinland-Palatinate’ is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in other world wars.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including training of the crew - is also a problem.
It's said to have reached fainting €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from initialing €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems related to the latest releases are particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany’s fleet power is decreasing.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the fleet actually ‘has almost ended of distribution-competent ships’.
The officer said that the problem has been built on over time, because old ships were destroyed, but no replacement ship was delivered.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigatets were able to join the fleet.
National Trust poachers on the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in hunting food.
It is hoped that findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano pipeistrelles and, moreover, the brown langøra and Daubenton flagermus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the property to track flag mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS added and volunteer will also perform mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat conversations and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a natural science advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat, natural worlds, are most important for the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the purchase of meadows and how it is best to maintain the same forest area for bats and other associated species.
Flag Mouse populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting resting areas and habitat/busite loss.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatments of construction material, and also attacks by pet cats.
Flag Mouse is actually not blind.
But because of their nightish hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eye when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect faults and obstacles in their flight panel.
NTS, responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, sleeps in inspections and sometimes saves lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the world of eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a nice area for bats," he said.
‘We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other possessions will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He emphasises the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within possessions, since it is possible that the infinite destruction of a single shrub could kill up to 400 female bats and young people, and perhaps erase an entire local population.
The bats are the peace and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are dangerous."
Mr Ronaldo rejects the right to vote in the lawyer's case in German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has marked the debt of power against him as "Fake News", saying that people "want to highlight themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and the Forward Juventus have been responsible for selecting an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, to its 142 million, follows only hours after the debt, that the debt is ‘fake news’.
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
‘They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They will be known to say my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a lucky man and all good; 'let the player to smile and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to suing Der Spiegel over the claims, which they have called 'an indisputable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy', according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for “moral damage in an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years.”
The alleged event is said to have found the city in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After attending a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the room of the player, where a claim that he should have chosen her anal, following the document submitted by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the assumed event and said he was a '99 percent' a 'good guy' and failed with 'one percent'.
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographed her injuries at a hospital, but was later agreed on a settlement because she felt “comfort of return” and was concerned about “becoming a public deaf.”
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to change the dwelling when she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the brink of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'ville for always undo' to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom ‘would undo it forever’ if it lost its status as a world leader before car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was ‘about’ that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom had left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
'We need an appointment,' said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border posts in case a non-contractual Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
‘My opinion is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we see production stops at our factory,’ said Marvin Cooke, the Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears of abandoning the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers are saying are the risks of supply chains in the event of a non-contracting Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a ‘just-in-time’ basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for ordered cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the limits that the industry claims may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's values of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "just calibrated to avoid checks at the limit."
'We must have an appointment. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but to arrest this possibility,' he told the BBC Radio 4s daily program.
‘Prove not only toyota, but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.’
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warn that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the plant, said that his members are more concerned about: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A spokesperson to the government said, ‘We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.’
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's outstanding meeting with the Nestleiarad lawyer Rod Rosenstein could be "press back a week" as the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Councils Robert Mueller, who investigate Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia and the potential obstacle to prosecution by the President.
Correspondent Trump will sail up the general to the prosecutors or not, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's self-esteem, has given nourishment to Washington gossip for several months.
In the past month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a rental to register conversations with Trump and the possibility to remove the President using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the white house, and it was reported that he was about to leave.
In the city, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would 'advantage' not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was appointed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission's hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who has accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into statements against Kavanaugh, which delayed full voicing from the Senate.
Trump his press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "No date has been set. It may be this week, but I can and can imagine that there will be a week late due to everything else happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the pressure up to date."
Some reporters may disagree: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientations was not due to a dissatisfaction with the TV reporter's game for the gallery, even though she said, "I'm not in agreement that they do it."
He mentions that direct contact between Trump and the pressure will increase.
"The President holds more press conferences than any president has done before," she said - quite rightly without giving proof of the claim. "We have looked at numbers."
Sanders says that updates will still happen, but "if the pressure gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it like this, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the President of the United States.»
Trump regularly accepts questions when travelling from the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's unusual for the president to hold press conferences aleine.
In New York this week, the president perhaps demonstrated who, where he performed leading the reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health secretary writes about Brexit-fryt to EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The health secretary has written to workers from the EU who work at the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though it is less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to bear the costs of applications which have a determined status for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: ‘In the course of the summer, negotiations have continued to take place between the United Kingdom and the EU, and it is approaching the expected end of the harvest.
Nevertheless, the British Government has stepped up preparations in the absence of an agreement.
I understand this must be a difficult time for you all.
So I'm going to repeat how much I'm spending on the contributions to all of them, regardless of their nationality.
EU and non-EU colleagues have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health work and benefit patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we would like you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an acute operation after head injury
The Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays on Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after pulling on an injury in the head when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports the newspaper The Tennessee.
Head coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporter that the damage happened just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a stretcher and took him behind for further evaluation.
An official spokesperson from Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt medical centre.
There's no detail about the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and added that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes the second year at university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five handles before he was injured in Saturday's struggle, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom.
Determined will neutralise the success of Corbyn by attracting young voters
Increases in document fees will be added for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Statskasse expects an increase of up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May today announces that foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who are putting up a lot of effort, with the promise to offer affordable homes.
In addition, the document fees will be added for individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of distributors.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on the second home and rentals, can be as much as three percent.
Statskasse expects that the decisions will get up to £120 million a year.
Around 13 per cent of new constructions in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, resulting in higher prices, and more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many well-standing areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become ‘exploratory cities’ because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time in other countries.
This new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson wanted to cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He charged a large design firm to keep prices up by obtaining property rights, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on reasonable dwellings to fix the United Kingdom’s ‘bustadskam’.
Corbyn has announced a series of eye-catching proposals for urban reforms, including controlled rentals and closed deportations for no reason.
He wants and gives advice more power to build new dwellings.
May said, 'I said last year that I wanted to deduce my position to bring back the British dream--that life should be better for every new generation.
That means fixing the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or foreign companies, to buy dwellings as hardworking British residents.
For many people, the dream of the owner has come too far away, and the apocalypse by being accumulating is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The boss of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his 'ultimate ambition' is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scots (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. At the third place in League One, they are only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
‘I would play for my country playing.
I got a B-land fight, and that's it," said Ross to Scotland's BBC Sports Sound.
‘But I was raised by watching Scotland on the Hamden side with my father, and there has always been something that has dragged me back.
The possibility can only come if I have success as a club manager.»
Ross' predecessors like Sunderland Managers include Dick Advocate, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously refused approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'For now, success for me will be measured in if I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.'
In view of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong at home in the Premier League," he said.
‘It’s not easy to get them there, but I can probably just look at myself as successful if I can get the club back there.’
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the training equipment of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to get from sinking to the third level, and transformed St. Mirren, who was about to move down, into the title winner of the championship series during the following season.
And Ross says that he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while he was playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a sign of distance," he says about leading Alloa.
‘I really thought that being a manager would suit me much better than being a player.
It sounds bizarre, because I did it well, lit well and liked it relatively well.
But gambling can be hard.
There are many things you need to get through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to stress and pressure on the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I have always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It is the most comfortable I have felt in my own body in my entire beautiful life.”
On Sunday 30 September you can hear the whole interview at Sportssound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.

The summer heat wave has led to an increase in consumption of stressed pubs in the United Kingdom, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July the hall increased by 2.7 per cent in barrage - but for the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 per cent, the statistics show.
The business adviser Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: ‘Constant sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern of June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder frames.
The decrease of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubar and barber selling drinks, made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
The pub that sells food, got and noticed the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It might seem that people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and barbers, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had gone down three percent.
Paul Newman, analytics for travel and leisure time at RSM, said: ‘These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sporting event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to the nightlife business.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still wear. A decrease in the hall of 4.8 percent annually will be bad to get at the top of a running cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not come at a worse time for food-powered operators. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a long-lasting breathing room.’
The total salsa increase across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the descent in the release of branded items.

One in five children have secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, shows an investigation
Examination of 200000 students in the future reveal an increase in false Insta profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a 'head' profile they're showing parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - make profiles on social media as they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 200000 e-mails on the future school revealed a strong increase in fake Insta profiles - a reference to the Image Sharing Platform Instagram.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile 'head' profile they refer to parents, while they have private profiles.
A mother who stumbled over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who called others to ‘chosen me’.
The research, made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) on various discs, found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of those admitted to having private users.
The boss in HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create locations online where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes ‘the voice of the Atletanes’ in the Scottish Freedom Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as non-administrative director at the annual general meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated liberalist in Scotland, and chairman Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience during the last decade.
‘Eilidh has a great deal of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world’s freedom society, and we are sure that the right of freedom in Scotland can benefit from getting her into the board,’ said Beattie.
Doyle said, ‘I’m eager to act as a voice for practitioners, and I hope I can contribute and help sports in Scotland.’
The American, which has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among its four OL gold and now is a regular guest at BBC, was unable to go for a drip.
On Twitter he wrote: “Today it is one month since I got hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it was only the time that could tell me if I was going to be okay again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've become quite good again, learned to go again, and today I'm doing flexibility services!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!»
Split devices on the Internet about chest pump advertising that compare mothers with dairy cows
A chest pump company has split opinions on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows.
In order to mark what is described as ‘the world's first quiet, pustifying chest pump’, the technology company Elvie dropped a small-faced advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump gives mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a tall-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes text like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you don't notice it, these aren't tensions, these are my pops."
The refrenge continues: ‘Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies’.
The advertisement, published on the company’s Facebook page, has, however, created controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it highlights the "pocket" of the dairy industry.
‘Very poorly decided to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from them only days after birth," one writes.
Elvie breast pump discreetly in an amme bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: ‘Motherly enough traumatic for both mother and child
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?»
Another added: 'For a remote advertisement'.
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she seems to sound "festile".
‘I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd have one if I still had a grandmother.
To pump made me feel like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product, entered one.
Another comment: ‘This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts or condemns the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump wrapped into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women as pumps say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is quite quiet, has no leads or pipes, and its discreet inside an amme bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their young, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: ‘The River pump is such a revolutionary product that it causes a wavel and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and dairy cows, we would like to put the search light on chest pumping and related challenges, and at the same time demonstrate the impossibility of the new pump, in a entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the moteuka in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants move in silence to tentleir within Texas limits
The number of prisoners in prison has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy of the Trump administration makes it more difficult to place the children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of our sponsors have undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and accepting a child can threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of this is increasing in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other mature family members are forced to submit fingerprints, and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence witnessed the Congress of Immigration and Customs and said that the Agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of single minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had nothing on their record sheet already.
‘ Less than 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to keep persecuting these people," said Albence.
According to the tenants, new rules have now been introduced to deal with the children. The rules require that some of them now have to be in court before a month has passed, compared to the previous 60 days.
Many will attend through video calls and not by personal attendance, to have the case tried to bring an immigration judgment.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely it is that they develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to selective eruptions or ejaculations, they say added to the clay. Reports that have appeared in the last few months tell the same thing.
Reporters say that these concerns are greater at large installations such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the facility, it is more likely that a child is missing out on signs of wear.
They added that moving children to the tentleir without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally, or say hat to veins, can strengthen the trauma with which many already wear.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw from sight
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who, acting as prime minister of vis-à-vis States, said that foreign forces are being held illegal on Syrian soil in the face of combating terrorism, and ‘will be dealt with from it’.
"They must withdraw from the assembly in a moment of time and without retribution," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the ‘war against terrorism is almost over’ in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight “a holy battle until all Syrian territories have been cleansed” for both terrorist groups and “unlawful presence of appearance.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-armed country.
When there was talk of the refugee problems, Moualem said that it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed ‘some Western countries’ for having ‘precede irrational fear’ about the surroundings that allowed the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
‘They're making policies out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem.’
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in restoring Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war is in place.
Diplomatar from the United Nations states that a recently created agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major insurrection, has created a possibility to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russian-German agreement rejects a major attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
Moualem nevertheless underlined that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including Nusra front warriors, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The U.N., Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of a member of government and opposition to draw up a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem sets out the conditions under which the Syrian Government participates in the Committee and states that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current Constitution", warning against disruption.
Why Trump will win another semester
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the presidency will end early because of scandals and national law.
It would no doubt be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!"
At the time of writing, there are no signs that the viewers have gone tired.
Since 2014, CNN has double its rating at the best transmission time of 1.05 million, while MSNBC almost has tripled its to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time, up from 1.7 million years ago, following Nielsen. MSNBCs "The Rachel Maddow Show" has a play at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers in evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are being lured off, because there's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama, "Designed Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Congress.
Nell Scovell, old comedy author and author of the "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She thinks a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 option.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why?
"Because he makes me laugh," he answered according to Scovell.
That's the entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television, history coming from Washington can decide the future to Roe v. Wade, if immigrants may be together and greet the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with a "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bombing jacket of the strutseller at $15,000 ("a piece of arrogant", said Washington Post) and the implications of the hideous description of Trump's, eh, anatomy.
Personally, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"The part of what he does that makes it seem like a reality program, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the daily leader at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creates by "Pawn Stars", about the show that goes with Trump's employees and daily disputes (go into a fight with the NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you are no longer hanging out.
When I hit Fleiss this week, there was over 25 degrees and the sun outside his world on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He was not able to turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Commission and the future to the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
'I think then we did all these crazy shows before in time, and people said 'This is the start of the end of Western civilization', said Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the densest middle game
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to being a conversion of the districts of Congress which led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
It recently surrounded the suburbs of Pittsburg, the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election last spring.
Lamb fights against another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative of the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
Map was redrawed after the Royal Court of Pennsylvania concluded in January that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has launched an arms draw on the financing of the campaigns, between the large parties its monetary arsenal, the Democratic Congress Committee and the Republican Congress Committee.
The Lamb was a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a densely followed special choice in Pennsylvania's 18th Congress district.
The seat had been listening to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a scarce advantage.
The United States assessed the punishment of El Salvador due to aid to China, but withdrew
Diplomatar noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama to parties throw out the Trump organization's rental group.
The State Secretary decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in an early appointment this month.
However, punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million dollars in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The legal penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials exposed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year that was considered a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administrators informed that they wanted the conference to continue, and put a stop to the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence is going to meet the conference, which has been scheduled in mid-October, as a signal at the relevance of the administration's presentation, said the diplomats.
And the three U.S. broadcasts quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American servicemen, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an unknown analyst who works closely with the administration and spoke during anonymity.
Study history
One waits for special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now considerable evidence in the Public Protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller will have turned the focus of the investigation into whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in their attack on our choice.
If Congress were to replace rulers, Trump would have to be right in this organ, in that he prepares to overwhelm the voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
It's a lot of 'what if' and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable—or for his counterpart in Europe.
There are choices to take for us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how prolonged the battle can be.
In 1938 a German officer was ready for a coup against Hitler, had only the West stood in against him and helped the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and missed a possibility to avoid the years of bloodbathing this led to.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's unspeakable march is accelerated or postponed.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What do we want to do if Trump kicks the wise Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water all the way since this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to intercept the president in hiding, wondering if he's a badass for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
‘How will we react if the recently asked FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible sexual abuses, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, do we want to vote in the middle election for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me out of the garden to light the Sabbath lights on the table that asked the swassika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before meeting Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that saying over the Australians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A broken prevented midway player Graham Dorrans in doing his first act this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
'That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,' said the 31-year-old.
‘I went into the struggle with the threat that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it at the end, but all in all, a draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and they were better made.
On Thursday, there will be another big European evening.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but there's a tough game, and they got a good result in their previous game, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been our trouble, with everything that has happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now feel all right.
The stack is good and the gutted thrives; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the previous season behind us and be successful.’
Women lose sleep over this fear of pension saving
Despite the fact that investigators had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a survey from the insurance company Nationwide said they spoke to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they were talking to their kids about it.
‘People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they do not take the necessary steps to have that conversation,’ says Vice President of the National Wide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not wish to make your wishes known well in advance.
Cooperation with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how to take care, as these options may be a major part of setting costs.
Pick up a financial advisor: Your consultant can also help you find out how to pay for these expenses.
The funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy for care, a life insurance policy with cash value to help pay the costs, or that you are making sure your own wealth - as long as you have money.
Create legal document: Disallow legal matches before starting.
Get a health authorisation in place, so that you designate a person you trust to have supervision of your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in line with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also judge a warrant for your finances.
You should select a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure that your calculations are paid if you do not have the right permissions to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: See that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write all these details in a written plan, so you are ready.
‘It’s not just the finances it’s all about, but who’s the doctors?’ asked Martin.
‘What kind of medicine is that?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready.»
Man shot several times with air guns in Ilfracombe

The victim of 40 years was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police cables describe the shooting, which happened around 02.30 local time, as a "random action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking for witness.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people are killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, says public servicemen. The number of dead people is expected to increase.
Without the ability to communicate, auxiliary workers have not received any information from Doggila, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake that had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, which are on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of the central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. The estimated population in 2017 was 379 800.
The city's 40th anniversary when the quake and the tsunami hit.
Doggala is an area extending over over 300 km with a coastline north-west of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than one province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and gardening are the berbehälken of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Doggala.
Nickel extraction is and important in the province, but is mostly concentrated on Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggla have been slowed down by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, following the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and several hundred houses destroyed by a tsunami in Doggala.
In 1996, the west side of Doggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia lies in the seismic age of the Pacific and becomes the regular frame of earthquakes.
Here are some of the big earthquakes and tsunamis in the last few years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December, a tsunami hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of large quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake of strength 6.8 hit south in Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that bumped into the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A earthquake with strength 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people lose their lives.
2010: A earthquake of strength 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 meters that destroys dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small quake hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the quake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost lives due to buildings that rested.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroys several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and aimed for the power of the world
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor of Alaska and Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested, targeted for assault.
Following a report released by the state police in Alaska, Palin (29) was arrested after suspicion of power in the world, interference in the reporting of power in the world and opposition to arrest.
In accordance with the police report, he took the phone from a woman known when she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin becomes custody prison in Mat-Su prison, and is held against bail of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared in the court Saturday and declared himself “not guilty” when he was asked, stated the network.
Palin is facing three miscarriages in Class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and get $2500,000 in fines.
He has also been targeted for a class B miscarriage, which can be punished by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin's been charged with anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with having attacked his father, Todd Palin.
Mora, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The thing's up in Alaska's veteran court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for attack into the world, involved in a reporting of the power of the world and to hold a weapon while he was in the context of the event.
His boyfriend had claimed that he struck her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised in 2016 by veteran groups after linking the son's elective behavior to PTSD that stems from when he served in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of lives lost
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, with a force of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed several thousand worlds.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit just outside the central part of Sulawesi, which lies north-east of the capital of Jakarta.
Videos that show the dramatic glance at how shaky hits, floring on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors will rarely have the death penalty for suspicion in New York terrorism
Federal prosecutors in New York will have the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare penalty that has not been imposed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) shall have used a rental car from Home Depot to implement an attack on a bicycle path along West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan in October, where he ran down pedestrians and syclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘willfully’ and that he ‘willfully’ inflicted serious physical injury, following a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be the basis for a possible death penalty, as stated in the legal document.
Week after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 prosecutions, including eight sights for murders with money blackmail targets, usually used by federal prosecutors in conjunction with organised crime, and a aim for the election and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack claimed ‘substantial planning and overlaying’, the prosecutors said and blamed the way Saipov carried out the attack as ‘disgusting, cruel and depraved’.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov causes injury and loss for family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Claves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrichi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, the note states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last South District in New York has condemned the death penalty in one case.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was condemned for having killed two drug providers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to engage in spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of indication in the days and months that followed, in accordance with legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was well, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, it says in the prosecution.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He has declared himself not indebted at all prosecutions.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says that they are "significantly disappointed" with a decision to the prosecution authority.
‘I believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma from the event of all those involved,’ said Patton.
The defenders of Saipov had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Member of Parliament in Tory thinks Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's armies" today, under a protest at the Tory-country meeting.
The former British independent leader said that politicians had to ‘feel the pressure’ from the Eurosceptics — one of Theresa May’s Members suggested that he should hire the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative, illegitimate MEP Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom had ‘had been out’ no, whether Farage was Minister of Brexit.
With the challenge of May facing reconciliation with its deep-split lines has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who want to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggled to keep the plan with the Chequers compromise on the right track after attack from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insist that she press for an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlog – and force the Eurosceptics and the Workers' Party to choose between its packages and ‘kaos’.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave Grouping in Solihull that he wanted to "return Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should be a noble rank and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had ruled, we would be out now," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers'.
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We do not fight world wars to be in subjection.
We will make our own promises in our own country."
Bone rejects the claim that the measurement of the people has changed since the 2016 elections: ‘The idea that the British people have changed meaning and want to be is completely false’.
Brexit champion from Tory, Andrea Jenkys, also participated in the march. She told the reporters: "I say only: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
‘Chequers is not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us chosen initially.
Please, drop Chequers and listen for it."
In a message addressed to May, it adds: 'State ministers keep their jobs when they keep their laws'.
Farage said that politicians must ‘know the heat’ if they were to betray the decisions that were made in the referendum in 2016.
"No is about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
‘They are trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them that “we won’t let them get away with it”.’
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: ‘I want you to get the political class, which is on the go to betray Brexit, to know the heat.
‘We mobilise the peoples of this country who gave us say in Brexit and shall not rest until we have become an independent, self-managed, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting in the center.
A handful of activists waved with 'Tories Against Brexit' banner after launching the group this weekend.
Labour-collain Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for security problems they had with a party-app during the opening of the conference.
‘This is a human being who tells us that they can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for a loss of friction, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland’, he added.
‘It is a total farse.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world's title after laworders give say over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the law orders of Mercedes were to have a major role during the course.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in that he defended his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and allowed Hamilton to enter the rear of the traffic in the back of the loop, which should be our decision.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a little later and came out behind the Vettel, but Hamilton ended up in front of a little action side-by-side which meant that the Ferrari driver had to let the inside be free from danger of being able to defend himself at the third corner.
The Max Verstapp started, on his 21st anniversary, in the rear row and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led large parts of the race as he went for a quick end with the goal of driving past Kimi Raikkonen, who was in fourth place.
He entered the deposit in the 44th round, but couldn't increase the speed of the last eight rounds while Raikkonen got the fourth place.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein on a election meeting Saturday because of her insistence that she did not paint the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she appealed to the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the witness ford had given the Senate Commission directly, but commented that what went on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and falter and speak false".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and unpleasant and talking untrue," he said.
‘When you look at publications and leaks and then say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you think?
Diane Feinstein, did you?
Do you think her answer... did you read the document--'oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not sow it.»
Please wait a moment.
Leek me... no, we didn't paint it," he added, while he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was playing earlier in September--but Feinstein denied that the leaking came from her office.
'I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't see her story,' said Feinstein to the committee, following The Hill.
‘Hon asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked me to.’
But her denials did not fall in good soil with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: 'I say you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While he continues to defend the Supreme Courtnominated, who has been charged with the poor sexual conduct of three women, the President suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
‘They are determined to take back power in every way they see necessary.
You see the badness, the weakness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president in line Mediaite.

The stars from Dundee compensated for the loss against Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return fight 5-3 on Saturday.
Giants got an early two-way attack from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie cancel out before Dwyer once again sent Giants to the rental.
Francois Bouchard settles for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen Sissa the Sayer.
It was the third wallpaper in the league this season for the gutte to Adam Keefe, who struck Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams of this season, where the Giants have won the last three games.
The opening to Dwyer came in the fourth minute after a assist from Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvilliers who double the rental four minutes later.

A pilot loses his life to ensure that hundreds of aircraft escape earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia is hailed as one right after he loses his life in what he continues to ensure that an aeroplane with several hundred passengers got safely into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and there are many who are trapped in wrecks in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for life, Anthony Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even though it was wild.
He remained to make sure that the plane that stood on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he thought it collapsed.
He died later at the hospital.
The President of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decisions may have scared hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We sent a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately he went away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
In the meantime, authorities are afraid of a number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis relief agency says that access to small towns in Doggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of dead people increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we can’t reach,” said the bureaucrat Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have broken Palu, which shall hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Emergency aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Each minute comes an ambulance with several bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
The small shops have been robbing.’
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: ‘The Indonesian Red Cross struggles to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country: ‘I ask you all to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with evacuation.
Are they ready?’ reported CNN.
Indonesia was killed earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Micronesia air traffic control: Air Niugini now reports a man missing after a lagoon flight
The airline operating an aeroplane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, reports a man missing, after having stated previously that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aeroplane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that from Saturday afternoon they do not know where the human passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide more details about the passenger, and its age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and crews after the aircraft ran the water as it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospitals.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in stable condition.
It's still unknown what caused the crash and what actually her.
Both the airline and the American Marine said that the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
“It was extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to vase through the water, which drove them up to life, to the nauds of the plane before it sank.
He said that the flight crew had panic and fright, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that sailing boats in the vicinity, working to improve a berth, also scared passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to land before the plane sank on about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website show that 111 people have died in collisions by PNG-registered airlines in the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analytics make timeline over the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution submitted all evidence of Saturday during the appeal for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department's analyst Paul Rowlett testifies for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He designed for the jury how he collected recordings from mobile phones to find out what she was doing the night when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett told Rowlett that he used location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers evening she died, as opposed to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis's cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone while he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
At that time, Tellis asked if he told the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was "loaning, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that for a while after Chambers died, Telli's messages, conversations, and Chambers deleted their contact information from their mobile phone.
'He deleted her from his life,' said Hale.
The defence shall end on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to go to the jury later the same day.

Another black person?!
New York Children's Passes suspense pair for firing after 'racist' text message
A babysitter in New York is suing a couple to give her a kick based on discrimination after receiving a wronged text message from the mother who complained that she was "one black person only."
The couple refused to be racist and compared the defendant with ‘pressing’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
‘NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, ENDEN EIN SVART PERSON,’ wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent him to Maurice the babysitter, twice.
After putting in her fault, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman babysitter Maurice fired, and said that the previous babysitter, who was afro-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, following The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for having fired her, and she wants $350 a day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was without a contract, where she was going to live with her family.
'I'll show them that it's not good to do this,' she said to The New York Post on Friday, and added, 'I know there's discrimination.'
The couple have denied that they are racists, and said that giving Maurice the kick was the only thing they could do after getting close to her, because they were afraid that she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she did not intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said the husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
‘But would you leave someone you have drawn close to your children, even if you didn’t mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.’
Plasco compared the defendant to ‘pressing,’ and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a ‘extremely difficult situation’.
‘Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a good thing to do,' said the investor Plasco.
While things are going on, public opinion is quick to judge the couple on social media, criticising them for their actions and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid that people wouldn't like a talking bear, revealing new letter
The daughters of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It is difficult to imagine how it was to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It is very funny to know now how successful Paddington was.’
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed her feelings during her book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
When it comes to Paddington, which she described as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was proud inside of how much success he did.
'He was a rather quiet man, and he never screamed,' she said.
'But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having kids who achieved something: you get proud of them even if you're not really behind them.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in that way.
Though it was his creature and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
When she landed her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice at all speed, how doctors work in vain to save her life.
'Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't think she would make it,' said Ednan-Laperouse.
“So Nad called to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy in you, dear.
I'll be there soon to be with you.
I'll be right back.
The medical doctors had given her for her heart to continue to pump was slowly on the way out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to turn herself off.
I just sat there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't laugh or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside.’
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now slept over the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane together with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
'No one knew anything,' she said.
‘I set with my head bent while my tears fell.’
It was hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy in her he was."
Sleeping women hanging notes on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who killed themselves try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached notes on a bridge in Wales to inspire and make people think about suicide to change their mind and call the numbers on the notes.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he started struggling with depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I know me every day."
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a talented chef with a smile that infected.
'Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up all the rooms."
But before he died, he ended up at work, for he was in a “very dark city.”
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was the first to find Tyler after taking his own life.
Davis said, “I’m still worried that the little brother may have been affected by Tyler’s death.”
Davis wrote his notes ‘to make people know that there are other people out there who care and with whom they can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone - you need to talk to someone.'
Humphreys, who has been a friend to Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
'He never told me he was sorry or depressed or anything,' she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the cellar emotional on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts he did not see on them.'
She told me that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they kept working through the trauma: 'There's a big void in our family now.
We're completely destroyed.
But we must all fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigation
'I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he asked for - a limited investigation - we could perhaps achieve some loneliness,' said Flake on Saturday, and added that he's afraid of the committee 'fell together' in the middle of a party-sanar-lock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They're keying because of the timing.
The intermediates in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans don't do it well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then was the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're going to be voiced in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh is able to gather at least 50 voices in the Senate, and with 50 voices, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, gives him the last voice and confirms him in the Supreme Court.
Number of skippers in North Korea " going down" under Kim
The number of North Korean jumpers to South Korea has gone down since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean legislator
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Department of Unit, and said that there were 1127 jumpers last year – compared with 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons why the number has fallen.
Pyongyang has not appeared public.
Most of North Korea's jumpers get South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been crossing the border.
Most of the refugees via China, which has the longest limit with North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China looks at jumpers as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically in war, have improved over the past few months.
This month, the tenants were met by the two countries in Pyongyang to negotiate the destruction of nuclear weapons.
These conversations follow the historic June meeting between the American president Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for an atomic free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho owes the United States not to achieve anything since then.
'Unless we can trust the United States that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot destroy our weapons first,' said Ri in a speech of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical,' saying he cannot serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said that he has too much temperament to serve in the American Supreme Court.
Pelosi calls Kavanaugh ‘hysterical’ in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
'I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she had been called 'hysterical,' said Pelosi about the testimony to Kavanaugh rather than the Senate court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all charges that he sexually harassment Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening speech of Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and cried out at times with lumps in his throat as he told about his family and the years onward.
He criticised the Democrats in the committee, and called the charges against him “growish and a planned attack on his reputation,” organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is prejudiced against democrats.
'I think that the way he behaved he disqualifies, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats,' she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if he was elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve a majority in the Representative House.
'I can tell you this - if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he's going to take the time,' added Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge of Washington D.C.'s federal appeal court.
Pelosi also said that as a democrat she is concerned about potential judgments from Kavanaugh against promises known as Obama and the matter of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative conviction.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he was afraid to answer questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
'It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great,' said Pelosi.
And women must swing the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and it doesn't get out without crying.
'We cry when we're angry,' said Steinem to me 45 years later.
'I don't think it's unusual, do you?'
She continued, 'I got a lot of help from a woman in a high business position, who said that she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she branch, 'You think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I am angry."
And then she just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant.
Towers act as a way of getting your mind out, but there's a lot of people who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memory from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I saw a sense of mind, and a woman who was older than me took me in my neck -- she was a cold clay that I had always been prepared for -- and pulled me out at the time.
'Never let them see you crying,' she said to me.
'They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry and that they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at that time was a congresswoman, a Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was taken to be an outrage on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she might as well be silent as president himself.
'I had not really thought through it well enough,' she said to me while she laughed, 30 years later.
‘There were already seven other candidates who made a choice, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already taken a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised she would only be quiet if she managed to collect $2 millinars.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
‘Do they think I get a discount?’ asked her.
When she declared that she was not going to be silent anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim at the voices instead of the delegates, and mind against gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
'You should think I had a nervous breakdown,' said Schroeder about how the press reacted to the article.
‘You should have believed that Kleenex was my lead sponsor.
I think I thought, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
‘Ho article’?’
How trade wars between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
Opening salves in the trade wars between the United States and China were deserted, and while the battle continued, a tear between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing on a long-term basis, says experts.
The U.S. president Donald Trump shot the first shot this year to tax important Chinese export goods, including solar panel, steel and aluminium.
The battle expanded this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set tariffs of between five and ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States for every shot they fire off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not to go wrong with the first.
To get Washington to stop, China has to do what the United States wants, but to bend to the United States is too flake for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the US pressure can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to fail is more dangerous than people have dared to admit before,' said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a thoughtmaker.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country that is destroyed after more than seven years of war.
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
Government is continuing to rehabilitate areas that are destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal areas.
All provisions are in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country in which they had to travel from fundamental terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond daily life and living.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled from the country since the war started in 2011.
Another six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.

Europe ensures saying in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 when they beat the American team with an end score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crowns of that team to the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, they reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, beat most of the tournaments, hit the ball in the water from the tea at the hole 16, couple 3, and gave the say to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all of his rounds and became one of four players who have ever received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was kicked out 5/3 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who divided into eight Ryder Cupar, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in the career.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't help it.
It has been a tough year.
So grateful Thomas chose me and believes in me.
I am so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European speaker.
He's passing the stick on to the countryman John Ram, who beat the American golf-legend Tiger Woods 2/1 in single game on Sunday.
"I know an enormous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup up through the career.
A strange statistics from one of the world's best players, who have won 14 major titles and are only disabled by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team snuck by finding the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the entire tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, made a disappointing statement from his team. 'I'm proud of these guys, they fight.
It was periods this morning that we made it hot for Europe.
We're going to lose.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a sole captain
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with PGA in America and our Committee for Ryder Cup and get on with it.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
One must take off his hat.
We were replayed.’
