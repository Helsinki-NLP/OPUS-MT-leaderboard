AM in Wales is worried that "becoming like puckon"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal follows plans to change the name of the National Assembly to Wales Parliament.
AM all over the political spectrum is concerned about being scorned.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who can't Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means jacks.
An AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "unsatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative walker said that his group is "open" for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is spoken in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation for the change of name, said: "The final decision for what members of the congregation are to be called is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly the Wales Parliament.
Regarding the title of the AM, the Commission proposed the Welsh Parliament Members (Members of Wales Parliament) or the WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
The AM seems to suggest other options, but problems with reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia shall conduct a referendum on the change of its name:
On Sunday the voters shall vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to close a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Mr Ivanov, opposes the referendum on the change of name and has said that he will ignore the outcome.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of names is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem encounter problems
"Elder people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's neither nor."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People hang out in other ways now these days," he said.
"Bars are not like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as far as the leaders expect and that "before or later they end up on the square one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with ownership apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually result in all the churches being closed, because those who move into the apartments probably will not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a nearby church took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's congregation planned the renovation, they also built the clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the clocks of the poor".
The expert who played the watch game in July had a different name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's are a complex history of architects and entrepreneurs – some of which have been hired by the church's playmanship, others by the episcopal foundation.
The Church General Meeting – the governing body of the congregation consisting of laymen – wrote to the Foundation in July and expressed a concern that the Foundation would "try to transfer the cost" to the Church General, even though the Church General had not been involved when the Foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some congregation members complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Haj damages 13-year-olds who dive after lobsters in California
Last Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who appeared after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7:00 in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and paddling there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that the whole key legs had been torn up.
"I cried to everyone to get out of the water." 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was flew to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition indicated to be critical.
It's unclear what a shark it was.
Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most people are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with departmental beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household markets, the larger beauty walks will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket's attempt to fill the shelves previously taken up by television sets, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they're planning to double their beauty range to up to 3 000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have greater space with marked areas, as in shops like Boots.
The retail chain is also launching its boutique brand again so that most of the products are vegan – as more and more young customers require.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test a stand in two Sainsbury's shops – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying less food every day in local stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like warehouses in an attempt to fight cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos-stand in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat-stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased the sales of food and made acquisitions more profitable.
The former attempt of the supermarket to give beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boot's sale in the supermarket would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's selling his pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, £125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an appealing environment in flexible locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "roasting" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of £11 million
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones is "fast" over the fact that TV presentationer Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time with their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their operations have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning presentation, 37, announced its decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den-star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle mark at the last minute – to focus on his new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources Jones became "fast" at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire last Tuesday when the TV-favorite admitted that her new contract – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The business has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she leaves Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly the main priority of Holly.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could think it happened last Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that this Morning presentation's decision to withdraw can cost the company several million due to significant investments in everything from pillows and candles to clothing and the risk of further delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as chairman in March.
Couples of vacations together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand leader of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Tight talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and that he was so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "Newman's voice":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said that Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have been on hold.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly this Saturday that North Korea does not see a “equivalent response” from the United States after the first disarmament step in North Korea.
He noted that instead the United States continues sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim has had positive results – an end to rockets, freed hostages and returned remnants of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we would have about 200 people here," said Trump and pointed to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy islands in Indonesia, hundreds die
Following the earthquake at Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10% of Lombox’s population had lost their homes, it was not a state of emergency, which is necessary for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear that they do not ask for international help, which makes it complicated," said Ms. Sumbung.
Save the children collects a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson of the Natural Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the anger of nature.
It has been built tsunami protection in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters further complicated logistics.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and rail.
But inadequate funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's elections.
Mr Joko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought the streets with machetes, pilgrims and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge signed off last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal of 89 minutes in Stamford Bridge, London, Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqi around 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was behind by 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the farthest pole.
The experiment flew high over the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalag's hope and ended up in the net.
"I only tried to get in a position to access the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach, and I didn't think so much about it, but I just kicked."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half of the game after a goal for the 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker poured a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spind off close to the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go by the middle field.
Then he got a great kick that brought Hazeard into the target area.
Hazard ran from the defense and got the ball in the net at the fart with a left foot kick past Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Naples at the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea is facing VIDEOton in Uefa Europa League in London at 15:00 a.m. on Thursday.
Death figures for tsunami in Indonesia rise to 832
The death figure for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the National Emergency Agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the wrecks of buildings that ravaged in the 7.5 earthquake that struck on Fridays and triggered waves of up to six meters, said the agency’s spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380 000 inhabitants, was full of busts from buildings that had been razed.
The police arrest, 32, suspect of murder after a woman is killed.
A murder investigation has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with knife wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to come out.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "We're at an early stage of the investigation, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is essential for our investigation."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim of his immediate family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can enter or leave the building.
He became speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it takes several hours to get back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the scene.
She says "it's so awful" over and over again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the lock-off and another one just outside.
A number of police assistants were standing inside the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victims of the debate on the transfiguration of history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crik's proposal "dearship" and "try to write about history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The icon class during the English civil war was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the opinion of the 19th century about and is part of the history of a man whom many people believe should still be hailed.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 1800s than now, believe Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be hailed and celebrated.
Killing Pig kills peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a South West China market, according to local media reports.
The man, who is only identified with his last name Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Lippanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post this Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject the vaccine into pigs in a pig trail on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a pig's trail nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig male in the pig's mouth with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid further attacks while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and those responsible for the market are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kilos pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can function as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're very curious and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The rest of Hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, the hurricane Rosa becomes weaker when it travels over cooler water on the north coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwestern USA in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tree begins to form across the Pacific Ocean and travel east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture to the north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching straw will create vast heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, clay streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly debilitating conditions due to the widespread tropical rain.
It is certainly not recommended that anyone enter the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can make canyons into rushing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The nearing straw brings some local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with total over a cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and tail roads.
That would be the first rain in the area during the rain period.
Some shone tropical rains will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in central America on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start on October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great chance for warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million looked at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million looked at Thursday's arrestary testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that should have taken place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued and the normal broadcast was suspended for Friday's last minute-twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI where they got a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh caught on her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million declared by Nielsen.
They calculated the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people looking from offices.
Comparatively, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the playoffs or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second most with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest continued high after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed demonstrators screaming at him when he tried to take an elevator to an interview with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators screamed at him, which was shown in direct transmission by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The television networks sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do it if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominated person in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have requested.
Flke was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of Great Britain and to undermine the national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's customs duties was "fully unreasonable".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect in the killing of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player on LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in custody for murder, said the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
The police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed that he killed Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The coroner in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report this Friday, according to which the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police police forces, police state law lab, Southern University police and residents in the area for help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU’s athlete Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their “work and pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Last Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "hidden" and "choked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about things like this all the time," said Wade.
Volcano asks ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the south of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been discovered in the crater and the registered 183 gas and ash emissions during the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several bogs and quakes.
Photos of social media showed thin layers of ash on wine windows in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased activity in the volcano standing 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police are affecting with Catalan separatists for the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona this Saturday after independence demonstrators hit together with the Kravallpolis, while thousands were participating in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote of Catalonia on September.
A group of masked separatists held back by the Kravallpolis threw eggs and color powder on them, which led to dark ponds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Fights also broke out later in the day, and policemen used their batons to stop them.
For hours, the independence groups cried out "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists cried out "long live Spain".
14 persons were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The atmosphere is still tense in the region, which longs for independence a year after the referendum on the first October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
A overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but participation was low when most who opposed the session boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1 000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to stop voting at election stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration still took place, but had to take another route.
Elektriker Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the protest of the separatists with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will be independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy about being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for independence have had difficulty keeping the momentum up this year, when many of their most well-known leaders live in self-accompanied exile or are in custody waiting for trial on their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his cell phone, said the conflict had been fired by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he will be able to take part in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"To be able to manage to the European Parliament is the best way of condemning the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men - 33, 34 and 39 - have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blummings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An armbrush may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 to Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the profits
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was divided into two with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side still hasn't got a gain away in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his profit to six games – the main coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances to cross visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead long before they scored; their directness gave Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after sliding in to measure Craig Halkett's nodding across the goal.
The home team was content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free park and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which scored from the middle of the target area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was invincible and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's definite games.
Crossings entered Livingston's target area and were handled without any problem. Two criminal requirements – following the challenge of Halkett's replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Every single one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their game style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skilled organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worralll right through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn't hold the measure – they only opened the home side once – and it's one of a wake-up clock for Rangers, which is located in the middle.
Erdogan gets a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday invited smiles and blue sky (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become dismayed over human rights, freedom of pressure and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new Mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their President.
Hundreds of anti- Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dulling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero of certain German Turks and is condemned as a one - souled ruler of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in crash by car
A cyclist has died in a crash with a car in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-propelled road in Deptford in southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the health care provider was called there, but the man died at the scene.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a contagion accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crash this Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his immediate relatives.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been redirected and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in unrest at a high security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The unrests broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and still going on.
Specialized "Tronado Watchers" have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Especially trained prison staff have been sent there to deal with the current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be assigned to the police and may receive increased imprisonment."
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in hospitals after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the police were called to prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiards.
The Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (areas with droughts can benefit)
It is rare for tropical low pressure to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy reaches the desert of the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona's border."
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Moglon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, probably get 2.5–5 cm of rain at risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is hit by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffer from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
The Orc Rosa will first cross the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength this Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travel north for 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which represents a considerable risk of flooding.
"Total 7.5-15 cm of rain expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in southwestern USA," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and clay streams in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested suspected of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST this Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the area of Radstock, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who might have filmed what happened to the cell phone to come out.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, meanness, anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the lack of consideration and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump to his followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered from the evilness, anger, from the democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress this Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he committed sexual abuse on her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress about his accusation.
The president said last Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of today's most skilled legal minds, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming middle elects.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I don't know, but I know," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "resent and hinder".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of increases
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed against the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities this Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed towards the beach at dusk and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
Tsunamine came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami alert came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of running immediately from there, and they fell victims of tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of Indonesia's disaster agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamine was not alone but dragged cars, logs and houses. It hit everything in its way," said Nugroho. He also said that tsunamine had traveled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the hit coastline.
Some climbed up into trees to escape tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 installations in Palu.
Flight photos released by the Emergency Agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershock still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesia Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT stated in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake last Friday was 200 times the nuclear bomb released at Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made tsunami larger, according to the Agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the bridge by collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and injuries can be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Doggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Dongila "was completely paralysed without any information," said Nugroho.
"It lives over 300 000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was criticised on Saturday for not informing us that tsunami had struck Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man is heard upstairs in a building screaming frenetic warnings about tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water breaks to the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a massive blackout that interrupted all communications around Palu, which hampered the rescue work of the authorities.
The military has started sending cargo flights with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated persons are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for the relief work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
People from World Vision in Donggala have taken themselves to Palu where they seek protection under tarpaulins on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Dosesba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have started the second aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may only be used if an emergency permit is issued after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can release international aid, but that status has not yet been announced."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that brighten up gloomy natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
Last Sunday, rescue workers saved a woman who's been stuck in a hurry for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paratrooper, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a paratrooper, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the paratroopers heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he was desperate to send whatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages only got a gray bock, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26 750 during the ATM refill at Newport on the Year
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26 750 from a Brink's employee who filled a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The car's driver had emptied a ATM at the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, another man broke up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that would be delivered.
The Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the perpetrators should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapparen changes its name to Ye
The Kanye West Rapparen changes its name – to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter this Saturday and said, "The creature that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41,has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change of name comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who set up for "female reasons" according to the programme's creators.
Ye is a abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word used most in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio values Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'one', to only Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of those we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously cooperated with West, has previously written his name with and without ties and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO swear not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution to students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza this Saturday to "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration in the square on the second October of 1968 and killed up to 600 people during a era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research within the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the US government have made statements on AI, although the US does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation before 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
A double as big budget can double the chance that the next major AI breakthrough will be done in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Valves, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that hit the top rated American Othello player, and later he was in the management of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what next would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work at AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI," he said.
The State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation gives funding to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations donating money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
The NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonian referendum on the change of name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a several decades old dispute with Greece which has prevented its efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that its neighbour in the north is a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change of name would undermine the identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts as to whether the minimum participation of 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid will be achieved.
The question of the elections in the referendum is as follows: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claims that it is worth changing if it makes Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was divided, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order for it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the election commission, no irregularities had been reported at 1:00 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the change of name, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small stage and place out chairs in front of the tents set up by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneaking in through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to much-needed investments in Macedonia, with over 20% unemployment.
"I think that the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said that a "Yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Surveys, between 30 and 43 percent of voters thought to vote in the referendum, which falls under the minimum participation required.
According to another study conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of participants thought to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them were going to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be counted, 50 percent of registered voters plus one vote will have to be voted.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the Western government's policy since it took over in May of last year.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero goes through Brighton's defenses to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's win of 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England this Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple when he scored for 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out in the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used its first kick in the target area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goaltender Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he made a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial take over in the Premier League game.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's rope at that game.
He sent off a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the farthest pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net moment before it ended out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the group game in the Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the playoff, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which is a game before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance to play the playoffs.
Rockies got a wild card place with a win of 5-2 over Nationals this Friday night, but are still looking for its first division title.
"We play about nothing, but we can have a chance to rub the rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not announced their starter for Sunday yet, but according to reports they lean against letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds speech in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation of Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the future middle selections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I don't know, but I do. That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power no matter what it takes, you see their evilness, their terribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We won't let them get it."
Democrats, he said, struggles to "resent and hinder".
"You've seen that in the last four days," he said and called the Democrats "arga and bad and terrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic senator, Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met by the high-bouncing from the spectators.
"Remember what she said?
'Did you cover the document?'
'Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm expecting a...' It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of MPs from Labour who are told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she was opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – ironically enough like subjects for which Jeremy criticised former leaders.
The Communication on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour last Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "friendlyr, gentler" politics has been forgotten long ago, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly evident that differing opinions are not tolerated within Labour, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leader accepts it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I previously thought had a similar political view that I expected to do a full conversion and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to – whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak in public – and it really doesn't matter what I say – follows a tirad of obsolescence on social media that requires me to be set aside, criticises my policy and says that I shouldn't even be in Labour.
And this isn't just gonna happen to me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when faced with a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments with this policy of yours is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality we are no longer this broad church and with every distrustful and change in selection rules the party is becoming increasingly narrow.
I've received many advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight ahead, so "it's in order."
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of thatcher's government that literally got my primary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as Prime Minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the last choice.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have been confused about my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with current leadership.
I would just like to say to those of you who promoted the application on Friday that when the country approaches a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why anyone would like to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour party leader.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no great deal of threats to set me aside or political comfort will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unbleached Ayr on top
Two attempts last minute may have distorted the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tentent's Premiership match.
They are now on top, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our games so far and are still unbeatable, so we are of course happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Clemo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to speak and Jason Baggot to make an unconverted attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a punishment, and at the end of the first half he scored points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 during the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half of the game and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long waiting for a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the restart Ayr increased the management again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's action captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-line-out behind Ayr's maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flank Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game Star seems ready for new careers in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant business after it has been discovered that he has been listed as CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays in together with his long-standing comedi partner Greg Hemphyll.
The duon has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Afjøgmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source on Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry".
"The Sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Sea again
Seafarers patrol a rich headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The fleet's bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon's berries are motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s is still strong – and it is also longing to sail again at the Pacific.
This hope is higher than in decades now when Bolivia awaits a decision of the International Court of Justice on the first October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, an atmosphere of unity and peace, and, of course, awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decisions of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will judge in favour of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them a separate discharge to the sea.
Monday's decision is also of great importance to Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court of Justice judges to Bolivia's advantage, and that not much would change even if it does.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to assign Chilean territory and has pointed out that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And in the last four years, it may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been cut by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She argues that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has tarried on Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been made exceptionally quickly.
On Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific Sea," he said.
"The conclusion is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea's Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not destroy its nuclear weapons until they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a Singapore Summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when the U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo seems to be on the line to solve the deadlock of nuclear epidemic more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "dream" that continued sanctions and the US protest against a statement to end the Korean war will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang starting significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism against Pyongyang’s intention to get rid of a weapons arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion tours reveal the latest line of huge headbands on their way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of broken, oversized headbands for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the styles of the Paris fashion week.
Incredibly unpractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent away their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's main creation was an excessive beige hat with a feather-like broad hat chest that completely took over the model's heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-picked watermelons, a wizard hat and even an pineapple – but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in due time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had sewn lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like a wet suit with a snorkel and a dive mask, and another looked like a melted glass rod.
And if you keep up the enormous courage, you're lucky.
Modest experts predict that the enormous altitudes can be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a width of 60 cm that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that was behind the incredibly unpractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The raffia bag in terrakotta, with electric fibers and a white leather handle, was excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
Luke Armitage's Knob said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills crucial for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are supported only by individual and collective advances in sport, art, music and other social engagements.
With up to 30 000 pupils in Scotland, schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement adapted curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desired subjects at schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we can not only rely on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final sample Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Language as a topic choice is now considered as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics at curriculum level in independent schools and beyond.
A study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills 2014 concluded that employers for various reasons had difficulty filling their vacancies, with 17 per cent attributed to a lack of skills in languages.
With this said, language skills become all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of career choices, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries, automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult Britishs published by YouGov 2013, 75 per cent responded that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that came up in total in a two-digit percentage (15 per cent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
To be able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages considered to be the most important for the UK by 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le fiaire.
John Edward, Head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make the debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays have not yet been decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week James was asked about his plans for Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games in this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Promotional Events, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump does his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote of his candidate to the vacant post of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the forthcoming interim elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress before the forthcoming elections in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you look at it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's interview by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited for charges about his sexual abuse, with an expected delay of the vote from the Senate for up to one week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November elections.
Thus, President Trump said that these five conventions next week aim to "engage volunteers and supporters when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign," said a spokesperson for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named Reuters.
The night's events, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can pull fans in from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been following the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come there to try to increase his opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is struggling to keep hopes alive before Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, the couples competitions this Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
Moment’s swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before, in front of competitions like these.
So what momentum is this about now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we carry it as a small momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in the sail, but they have much to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been vase from the tea to the green and is preceded by a good example.
The wine trope scaled even higher when his round continued and he lowered a crucial pit to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had been following two after two games.
His putt who won them the game of 15 met with a similar wreck, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cups indisputable story.
Europe's odd but stunning couples are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bookey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bookeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back Nine on Friday morning.
These performances and audience reactions state that they are the players to turn on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could come home with a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
They're both representative, simultaneously on different holes.
It is, however, too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, tomorrow's four-ball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on front nine sunk the Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they never even got nearby to crawl out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are so fascinating to look in close quarters because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the Team USA has a passion that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cups the last day after coming out of Saturday's quad and foursomes matched with a 10-6-line over the US.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, which fought to keep the bag that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American law that never really started during the morning's quadriball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but it wasn't enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, baptized to "Moliwood", after a sensational weekend, just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in quarries, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more expressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who settled through two games on Saturday, showed tests at single moments of the brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in foursome and foursome, and of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's quay and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe had no wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team come back from a four-point sub-position in single matches, however, Furyk's page only needs a firm result to keep the bags.
After two days of being the second best, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday might be difficult to get through.
North Korea says that they "never" will disarm unilaterally without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations this Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures to show its goodwill" during the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing installations and promising not to spread nuclear and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see a corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to an approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would lead to North Korea being rewarded when it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, because it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution, as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit of a sitting U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards the "decommissioning of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has applied for a formal end to the Korean war 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused negotiations to ease international sanctions against North Korea.
"USA insists on "decommissioning first" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even objecting to "the declaration to end the war", says Ri.
"The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wish dream for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our disbelief."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leaders highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister pointed instead to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the U.S. mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The maintenance of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without failing until we realize a complete, definitive, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. North Korea, however, accused him a few hours later of setting "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear crisis complex if the United States took "the corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he sought were security guarantees which Trump promised in Singapore and moving towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "deepings".
An academic study found that students at the world's leading universities are often unconscious about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first in his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect of sleep failure on learning.
"At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the University's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students suffered from severe sleep shortages during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where the students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athetic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep failure can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the students' behavior right away.
But we think they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "deep" still exists, he says and added that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on the students meant that sleep lack was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course and has read one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before they start their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" issued by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn around in the day, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas's goal lowers Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0-down team in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home its first victory on the road since February 4-1-triumf at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gernard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half time and Rangers never managed to smooth out the result.
While Rangers now fall down to the sixth place, the Livingston climbs to the third and is only behind the Hibernian on the goal difference.
And there may be more problems on the lye for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a main year after an object was thrown off the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinal in Betfred Cup.
Holt on the other hand went with the same Livi 11 who took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-sacrificed game passed the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have become a goal already two minutes into the game when Mengas first pass released Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle fielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep frisspark from Keaghan Jacobs then reached the team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back pole.
Rangers took control of the match, but it seemed to be more hope than belief in their game during the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo surely felt that he should have had punishment when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibalys nock and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livi's opening shot in the 34th minute may go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their kneeling deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to handle Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the prey gave almost immediate effect when the outsides hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swept up long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened its lead at the last stage, but McGregor managed to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside the corner.
Ranger Glenn Middleton had yet another late demand for punishment when he was tortured with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now one page from Sunday's almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manicure called Geiger meters.
Geigermäter has become a foundation for science since then and also figures large in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the main role in the seemingly unlikely cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it pops now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "produces the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explains Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and “learning” them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing an MAGA cap, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was built out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swimming performance where he commended the US President Donald Trump and said that he himself would be able to manage for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great cap, he railed against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood Star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee on the charges of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it was not sent, the playback of West's exhibition was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headband.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I fell low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to fall low too?" and said that he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Test with love."
His comments attracted more burops at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed to be generating, reported Variety. One person said, "It became the deadliest in studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with his appearance of the song I Love it, dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: TACK TO DOWN YOU TO THE MOB."
But the host of the prats show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We're in, she'll add.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkolleg, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
They're trying to find a knife cut at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to enter the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington beats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-changing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has expressed a negative opinion about the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-player in the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even her 31, admitted that he knows "very strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel quite strongly, right now--where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculinous characters.
He went on "What's native and what's learned?
What is taught on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it is really one of the big issues of our time - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new recording by Sam Shepards True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so that way it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in which Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love, in the Emmys winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transferred via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero,” said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an acute issue in China’s HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection in the case of sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking the GOP-senator's tasks, blaming on "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The American Congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles-Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lights, lies and more reprehensible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information contained, as stated, the addresses and telephone numbers of the Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water’s office and released the information about a member of Water’s staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water’s statement quickly got criticism online, including from White Huset’s former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament of being a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They can't be stubborn.
They must not question the motive of the questioner.
They must be calm and sensed."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's response to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was able to set aside Waters in the middle of his term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Very true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit services in each new film with British tilt, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodys that started in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is Vass satir coming about how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been given his license to clant to cause for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comical creation for the bio-public even in non-English-speaking countries
He is of course the crazy secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothieglamour, has got a little bit of Clouseau, a gnot Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two fine moments in the latest JE movie
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades struck his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels quite low and strangely redundant, especially since the “serious” film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The mood feels as if it's adapted for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English is strange to pick up not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movies in the role of Bean.
The current issue is that the UK is in serious difficulties.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, which reveals the identities of all UK agents out in the field, to the agent in the great dissatisfaction of the service - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and hard-earned figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence advisor informs her that when each active spy is occupied, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in some wealthy institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art to work undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with its former long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly hockey-sticks role where Vicki Pepperdine is close to the safe.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terriblely wrong at Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounters Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard on the charismatic techbillionaire, who claims that he can solve Britain's computer trouble: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssé of farsarted tugs: dressed for waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on board Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but although the film is both charming and speedy, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderate everything like everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies the drawing up of a plan for British workers to work for a four-day week but receive a salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Party Labour is considering a radical plan that involves the British working for a four-day week - but being paid for five.
According to the party, corporate leaders want to leave savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but keep the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would "pass" with the economic agenda of the party for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trade union organisation Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A representative higher up in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits into the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Party The Greens who promised a four-day working week during their election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A spokesperson for Labour said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and there is nothing that the party agrees on."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power from "faceless leaders" and "sniper" of state companies.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get back all their efforts, as a Labour government can make "deduction" because of what they perceive has been wrong acts.
He also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10 percent of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, who then have annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell you in the "60 minutes" television programme whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the Office's investigations could cause some Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to their change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems unshakable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamium tank design," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it strongly," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changes."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a tremendously impressive performance of stars and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people travelling to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goals of the event: to fight extreme poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international proponent group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, ringing or other meaningful ways to raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen states that more than 19 million "documents" have been registered from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group appreciates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and stakeholders engaged in "helping children to develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help combat malnutrition in the area after having received more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition is a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Tracey Ullman partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken requiring the United Kingdom to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced financing of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programmes aimed at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on his website, "what makes you think that we can fight extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who are performing at this year's event in New York, whose hosts are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicate the Minister for Home Affairs
The government can "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has the US Minister for Home Affairs Ryan Zinke revealed, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it appears to be the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"USA has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the waterways are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinc spoke to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they really are the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels", he said, while referring to Russia as a "day-end" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump Administration officials, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin the "capture".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington's opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's Minister for Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with the U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position was set back by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly dislike that a third party disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she is to stand up in the presidential elections in 2020," says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential elections after the US interim elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself as a candidate.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'm going to take a big thinker to get to the President's office."
Warren weighed into President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said that he " took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been a free language in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court of Justice, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We obviously need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote which was released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe she would be able to do so in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "faithful" Massachusetts picker said that the senator should not be able to, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after having been served in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience with PTSD and part of the trauma with which our soldiers return," she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elite in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back as other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent a report on domestic violence and possession of arms in a drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, as well as the District of Columbia, support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Arton states and the District of Columbia support a judicial trial aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who flee gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friendly-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
Full name of the claim in Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang members" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with domestic gangs and violence.
The new American asylum policy amended a decision by the immigration authorities of 2014 which enabled illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape from domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the Friend-of-the court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the policy that denies the entry of immigrants damages the American economy and argues that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "deliver the necessary workforce".
In June, Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asyl was never meant to alleviate all the problems - including all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperata rescue operations in Palu when the death figure doubles in the pursuit of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked more and more bleak.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his feudy boy in a evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"Ambulance fetches dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a shortage."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rooted through water-damaged possessions and tried to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged in the earthquake of 7.5, were overfull.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the hospital Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong resuscitation.
With tears in his eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't run.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador accused China that Beijing used the American press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a supplement in Des Moine's Register - state Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accused China of trying to participate in the US 6th Congress elections, something that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters where is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with increased tariffs on each other's imports.
China's recovery tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa supporting the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador in China and the former long-standing Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
China, wrote Branstad in a debate article in the Sunday's Des Moines Register, "Now doubles the bullying by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The government of China uses America's dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertisements in Des Moine's Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newspaper shoot on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of diverging voices and will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economy, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers nodded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters before the interim election through Kavanaugh fiakot, warn analysts
Since many top republicans defend the Supreme Court's nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who is faced with several accusations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, during the forthcoming elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
It is not possible to turn back the clock, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published this Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)' last attempt at an FBI investigation will suffice to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning they scandalated "November coming!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the republicans controlling the court committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go on the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indeterminate female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote."
Already before Ford's public testimony with allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or about Kavanaugh coming through, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with her," said Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, to the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as those of at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez argues that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed her genital organs while attending a party during their time as a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web is planning to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology doctor, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data big" or a POD.
It may include contact lists, making lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser simultaneously.
What's unique about the personal online data storage is that it's all up to the user who can access which type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers to work with the project and a group of volunteers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed at the top of a night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a post on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Priest rewarded with Viktoria Cross during World War I celebrations
The only priest in the Church of England who was rewarded with a Victorian cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the British military's most prestigious prize.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his granddaughters, Michael Vann, said it was "brillant symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the prize.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col won on September 29, 1918, led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the shot line and led with "great bravery" the line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "what I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble about."
He and his brother Dr. James won also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've stopped up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 games, including sex on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were not impressed after they had stayed awake until the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a cartoon children's program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president for marketing and communication when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes"
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said that they will work with their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we'll be able to find a solution in terms of the fare," said Coker.
"But there's sex in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was, in fact, a government issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "underlying" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to his peers during his childhood because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights in order to give others "hope".
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show’s regular programme director, Kirsty Young, has taken the job a few months due to illness.
During his one-off performance at Laverne's first program, Daley tells how he felt "less worth" than others during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worthy of me and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "somebody," he said, so that he did not betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The dual Olympic bronze medallator has become a high-profile advocate of HBT rights and took advantage of its appearance at the Commonwealth Games of Australia this year to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hop".
The triple world champion said that his love in a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013 - "come as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "full perspective of life" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold, he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they got their tickets to the Olympic Games in London in 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row of Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a home audience on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choices - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and still gave him Russians.

Mickson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting cheers and training on his game in the hope of having a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the top of his career, and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough course at Le Golf National, where the long ruff often punishes misses hard.
It is not only the banana that discourages, in the ninth game on Sunday meets the Mickelson master Francesco Molinari, who, together with the novel Tommy Fleetwood, won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below in front of the 12 single matches, have a tailwind at the start, then Mickelson's game can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role that he had today, gave me a pat on his back and laid his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence, there's nothing wrong with it.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd manage more, but now it's as it is and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Fallo's record passes for most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said that his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, quick, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory only
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where one team under the leadership of Seve Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally won with the smallest margin with the result 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds you that we led big on Valderrama, we led big on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with necessity and naked," said Bjorn (on the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give it all.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the score on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this bag and that is where our focus lies.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was pleased with the performances of his players on a tough golf course and added: "I would never manage this myself.
Tomorrow we'll have new challenges.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply and that is a completely different matter.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golf player is tested in full.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, getting out the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Björn, the opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major reverses during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he stopped as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to go out as quickly as on Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the pace starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these mid-games.
We made our setup and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the battle and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," said Bjorn about his single choices.
Germany’s new warships are being delayed again
The German fleet's newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leadership ship for the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg companies, has now been postponed up to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine, which quotes a military spokesperson.
The ship should have joined the fleet as early as 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were fatal for the ambitious project.
The four ships in Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the Bremen ageing companies.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of air defence and maritime missiles, as well as some smuggling techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are put into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 company created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media indicated a number of important "quarus and hardware errors" that made the warship useless if used on a battle mission.
Weaknesses in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a manning of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It also appeared that the ship has a significant excess, leading to a deterioration in performance and limiting the marine capacity to perform future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Palatinate" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar vessels used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project's price tag - including crew training - will also be a problem.
It is said to have amounted to EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion at the start-up stage.
Problems affecting the newest Frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's sea power.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet actually "begins to have a shortage of fully equipped ships".
The official said that this is a growing problem, since old ships are being wound up but no compensation vessels were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the Marines.
National Trust poachers to the secret life of the bat
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help to control future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the South and Dwarve Pippistrell as well as brown lending and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special players will be placed in important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for the bat and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest fields for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects farmland and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks from hu tax.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspects bon and sometimes conduct rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threeave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home for eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here on Threeave we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of wheat trees and a variety of favorable habitats.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before carrying out maintenance in real estate, since it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly eradicate an entire population.
The bats are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to speak the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "fake news" and says that people "will market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will meet the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims to have paid her 375,000 dollars to keep quiet about the event, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) broke down the reports as "fake news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the demands were reported.
"No no no no no.
What they said today was fake news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good," said the player and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to challenge Der Spiegel's allegations, as they have called "an unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her anally, according to documents submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percentage".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries to a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "afraid of retribution" and was worried to "be humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to traumatize by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Britain "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain would "repent forever" if one lost its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was 'oral' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement they will temporarily cease production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event that no agreement is concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main problems concern what car manufacturers say are the risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it can lead to disruptions at the border as the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and hence production would be forced to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that makes possible, as I say, not only success at present to be appreciated now, but for us to take hold of this opportunity." he said to BBC Radio 4:s program Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increasing costs would reduce plant competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite trade association at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
A government official said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "shooted in another week" while the fight against it to the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues," said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardising Mueller's independence, has been fuelling Washington's bells for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying interception equipment to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of devoting the President via the 25th Amendment of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House and reported that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "prep" not to kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Committee's hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein she said: "A date for it has not been established, it can happen this week, or a delay with a week in view of all the other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would dispute the allegation: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any dislike towards television reporters who "play for the gallery", even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds several questions than any president before him," she said and added without citing proof, "We've looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, says Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do a lot over the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, perhaps the president showed why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the collective reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland in the light of concerns about Brxit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of phased status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, with decisions expected to come this autumn.
However, the British Government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I value every employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Collegiates from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after he has suffered head injury
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie undergoed an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury in Saturday's loss with 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's main coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage occurred just before half time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before he was placed on a stretcher was carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operated at the hospital Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/range of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which gave him a seasonal total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp taxes when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp taxes when purchasing property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless, according to the new plans of the Tory Party
The action will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase of the stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The UK Finance Department expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of housing with more affordable prices and aiming at high income earners.
The increase of the stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK. The extras will give a boost to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is added in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and dwellings purchased to rent out. It may be up to 3 percent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will attract up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are purchased by persons living outside the UK. This drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot into the housing market.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new play will only be a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas for affordable housing to solve Britain's "deplorable housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an up-to-date proposal for housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to bills without the tenant's fault.
He also wants to give municipalities greater opportunity to build new dwellings.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in Britain, and also for companies based abroad, to buy housing as for hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of owning your home has become for too many people just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to practice Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says that his "final goal" is to ever become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shots look forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeastern England, which is currently located in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-land team and that's all," says Ross to the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But when I grew up I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my father, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club."
Among Ross representatives as trainer for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about succeeding so established names in such a large club. He has previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now I'm assessing success based on the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club definitely belongs in the Premier League, given its structure and talents", he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as a success here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as a assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15 month sejour as a member of the Hearts coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa return from the département to the third division, and lifted St. Mirren from being close to the département to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more happy now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a reason for the road," he remembers and refers to when he took command of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was quite right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had fine results and could live with it. Besides, I had some great success.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to get through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels quite right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I do. I feel better than I've ever done in my adult life."
Listen to the whole interview in Sportssound, Sunday 30 September at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00
A survey shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday.
Summer’s heat waves have increased revenue for the country’s fighting pubs, but the restaurant chains have been pressured more.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Advisory Company, who has compiled the figures, said: "Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared with June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%. However, the restaurants had even greater difficulties.
The decrease in restaurant turnover by 1.8 % in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars offering drinks in particular showed the very best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than restaurants had gone down.
Pubs offering food also had difficulties in the beautiful weather, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seem to want to go out and drink something.
The impact on managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales down by 3%."
Paul Newman at the serving and entertainment business analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in sales in the big kitchen market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% every year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to current cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come more inappropriate for companies driven by food sales. The time must be shown if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give some needed respite."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July. This reflects the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
The business sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub-bar and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyses data on how 47 active groups have a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram sites
The result has been an increase in concerns about sexual content being put up there.
20 % of the students indicated that they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years of age, creates social media accounts that they keep secret to adults.
A survey among 20 000 high school and high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "Fake Insta accounts", a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The result has been an alarm over the fact that sexual content is being posted there.
20% of students reported that they have a clean "main account" that they can show to their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager who urged others to "fight me."
According to the study, carried out by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of children had two profiles between 11 and 18 years of age, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Freedom Union, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an external member of the board at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most praised athlete, and Ian Beattie, President, describes the elections as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead sport to take advantage of her wide experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator at the BBC. He lost the ability to go for a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time had to be shown if I were to recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again and now I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all your encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with where parts of the internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused differences on the internet with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are being milked.
To draw attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video inspired commercial film with humorous appropriations to show what freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a stuffed barn with cows to a song with lines of text like, "Yeah, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and, "If you didn't know it, this isn't a jubilee, but tits."
"Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
However, the commercial film, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a conflict on the Internet.
The film has received 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, and has experienced mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say that it sheds light on the dairy industry's "phases".
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like we must become pregnant and food to produce milk, but their kids are taken away only a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comment is: "It is traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another person adds: "What reality-rejected commercial film."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterical fun."
"I think this is brilliant.
I would have gotten one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial film is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," writes someone.
Another comment: "This is a fun commercial film that turns to mothers pumping (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like 'coss'."
This is not a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuffed in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on many women pumping milk saying that they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be carried discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The river pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges of it, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and easily recognizable way what an incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London’s fashion week, a two - child mother appeared on the catwalk with the clothes of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved silently to a tent camp near the border in Texas
The number of captive migrant children has been increasing even though the number of people crossing the border is relatively unchanged every month, partly because the attack of rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump government has made it more difficult to place the children with reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Swedish Immigration and Customs Authority, testified to the Congress that the authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be referees to unaccompanied minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since then.
"Almost 80% of the persons who are either themselves reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to pursue these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal with children's matters more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to enter the court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was previously the practice, according to the personnel of the establishments.
Many of them are present on video link rather than in person to bring their action for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to be entitled to protection are rapidly deported.
The longer children are deprived of liberty, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to personnel in the facilities and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
The proponents say that anxiety is rising at larger plants such as Tornillo, where indications that a child is more likely to be ignored, because of the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and to say good-bye to friends, the trauma of many people may already be violated.
Syria requires US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem underlined that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the government of Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war - torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "certain Western countries" of "dispersing irrational fear" that is causing refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return", he said.
"They're politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last great rebel mount Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement ruled out a large-scale attack on the province by Russian-supported Syrian troops, who have three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed the hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusra front, who will "to be wiped out".
The UN Messenger Staffan de Mistura soon hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government members and members of the opposition, in order to draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the group's work would be limited to "the review of the articles of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election in 2020 unless his presidency would be concluded in advance through national law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what no doubt would be "the most dramatic final of a presidency ever!"
At present, there is no sign that the viewers have tired.
Since 2014, the viewing figures at the best transmission time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best transmission time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked the lists of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news nights.
"This is like a fire to which people are drawn, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitol.
Nell Scovell is a long-standing comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Nell Scovell tells me.
The chaos has a entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television, the report from Washington can determine the future of the miscarriage case, Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, in addition to being an informed citizen when you have suddenly sat and looked for six hours at an expert panel that debates Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich leather for $15,000 ("a garment filled with hybris", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Storm Daniel's macaroni descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"One part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump-following roll crew and day-to-day intriger (muck fights with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single episode, you'll end up in the afterlife.
When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he was sitting in the house and watching MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He couldn't rip himself off, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be faced with the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the scales.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the smoothest race ever before the mid-year elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congress district receives a lot of money. It is thanks to a restructuring of a Congress district that has made two members now compete for the same place.
This recently rewritten suburb district in Pittsburg is represented by the democrat Conor Lamb, who got his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb is campaigning against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-designed after Pennsylvania's Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were fundamentally changed to the Republicans' advantage.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign finance struggle between the major parties' economic sections, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a button win in a wide guarded special election in March to Pennsylvania’s 18th Congress district.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain advance.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for China support but then backed up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners evicted the Trump organisation's leadership team.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "new decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert’s spokesperson in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions against El Salvador were only planned, which received an estimated 140 million dollars in US aid in 2017.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
In mid-September, however, senior administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October. It is a sign of the importance of the Presidential Administration’s meeting, said the diplomats.
And the three U.S. messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three American officials, two diplomats of which agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next inevitable step may be the Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged abuse in legal proceedings, for which there is now substantial evidence in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to direct his investigation against whether Donald Trumps campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the Congress were to change the majority, Trump will be held accountable to that congregation just when he prepares for once again in the elections, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We all need to meet different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the excerpts of the struggle can be.
In 1938 German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had resisted him and stood behind the Czechs' legions in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbathing that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the infallible advance of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he should have proposed to record the president secretly, speculating that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is not correct.
"How should we answer whether the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or whether he may enter the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was Czech Slovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazistigim who once occupied my ambassador residence.
She survived, migrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me away to light the Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the pickets.
With that as an inheritance, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal that ended undecided earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in Europe League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 game against Villarreal. But he believes that Rangers can use the result as a leapboard for major success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and went away with a point.
Perhaps we could have got it in at the end, but overall, it was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we came back in the second half and it was better team.
This Thursday, it will be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their latest match, but if we have the audience with us we can probably jump out and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep badly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care if you do not talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may have a major impact on costs.
Take help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a cash-value hybrid life insurance solution to cover costs, or a self-insurance with own resources, if you can afford it.
Create legal acts: Avoid legal conflicts from the beginning.
Create a nursing authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who will review your medical care and ensure that the healthcare professionals follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Also consider a warrant for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in place of you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to pay yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you then be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"It's not just the economy at stake, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.

Who's taking care of the dog?

Fired several times with air guns in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air guns as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, who is 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place approximately 02:30, as a "suspect event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life-threatening, and the police call on witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia last Friday.
Communications are out of date, and rescue staff have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Doggala management area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake epicenter. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city’s population was estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Doggala is an administrative area that extends along more than 300 km of the coast of the north-west Sulawesi.
The management area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 people in 2017.
The pillars of the Central Sulawesi's economy are fishing and agriculture, especially the Dongila coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongila have been hit by tsunami several times over the last hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Also in 1996, Western Doggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circular seismic fire, which is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A great earthquake at the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Västra Sumatra.
More than 1 100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten metres was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidie Jaya administration in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the destruction at the fatal earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings collapsing together.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice president Sarah Palin, has been charged with assault.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, for having been involved in a report on domestic violence and for having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he's supposed to have taken the phone from a woman friend who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su custody and is held against the $500 bail due if the suspect violates the terms of the bail, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to state his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of minor crimes under Class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and $250 000 in fine.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious crimes under Class B, which is punishable by one day in prison and 2,000 dollars in fine.
It's not the first time that Palin is accused of crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of having entered the notification of domestic violence and of the possession of weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of beating her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which originates from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunami broke into the coast.
Federal prosecutors appeal for a rare death penalty for a suspect in terrorist attacks in New York City
The federal prosecutor in New York is demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, must have used a rental car from the construction and interior chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He meshed down pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious body damage, according to the intent declaration of the death penalty lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both prosecutions may involve a death sentence, according to the court case.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, which is often used by federal prosecutors in the field of organised crime, as well as abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "wide planning and intent", said the prosecutors, and at the same time described the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Claves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrichi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss", it says in the declaration of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York has not charged in a case where the death penalty is sought in a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple Rosenberg were both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbek, showed a lack of regret according to the court documents during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked for the IS flag to be placed in his hospital room, reported the police.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 charges in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "fortunately disappointed" on the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of agreeing to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant admits to guilt only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to all concerned," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Member of Parliament from Tories says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at Torie's conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "feel heat" from EU sceptics when one of Theresa May's own Members proposed that he conduct negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member Peter Bone said, at the March in Birmingham, that Britain would already have gone out if Nigel Farage had been Minister for Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by Theresa May in getting the deeply divided supporters to be reconciled has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under attacks by British hangers, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, and force EU skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and 'kaos'.
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by the organization Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spoke Chequers" agreement.
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the helm we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, representing the Wellingborough district of Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must flush the Chequers agreement".
He made clear his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world war to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The belief that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue."
The British follower Andrea Jenkys from the Tory party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with the party and with our election workers who are on the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Put away the Chequers agreement and start listening."
And she added a sharp message to Theresa May: "Premier ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "feel the heat" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say to them, 'We will not let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilise the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in central town.
A group of activists waving tracks with the text "Tory Members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour MEP Lord Adonis from the House of Lords mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"These are the people who say that they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus the plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a clean father's.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning a "real thinker" to be able to get to the Presidential post.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "ordinary thinker about running to the Presidential post" after the November elections.
The newspaper Boston Globe reports that the democracy from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in Western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and now stands for re-election in November against the Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was Deputy Chairman of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been the subject of speculation that she might take Donald Trump 2020.
The event of Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th town hall meeting with the voters since Donald Trump joined.
One person asked her if she was planning to go to the president's office.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means a woman on top.
A person arrested for the shooting of basketball player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the killing of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to get help identifying a man seen on the pictures.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University's campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot in the head and finally died of this," told Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sport.
Wayde went between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had been in the scene and had a weapon, and he confessed that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and was taken to the custody of the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starter last season, and averaged at 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Championship after team orders gave him profits over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out on the drought when he defended his position during the first two yards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the dead first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the cluster, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went on a lap later and came out behind the Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of offering on the spot after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and lay seven at the end of the first yard on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held in the tires to reach a fast goal and drive around Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he arrived in the deposit of 44th yard but failed to speed up the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen went up fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two," said Hamilton.
Real Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly mention the testimony from Ford before the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "elak, nasty and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the fine thing that's happened in the last few days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Did you leak, Diane Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it.'
Wait a minute.
"If we've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't darked Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the committee according to the newspaper The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her dementia doesn't seem to have fit the president, who, during Saturday night's meeting, commented it like this: "I'll tell you one thing.
Maybe she hasn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual crimes by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by all necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to gain power and control," said the president, according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars served Friday's loss in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-way lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard signed for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting for the season of the two teams, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer’s opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvili doubled the management four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who complained at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again signed with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the profits with his team's fifth halfway through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of its last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died so that hundreds of people on a plane could escape from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the brink of the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu.
He stayed to make sure Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would fall.
He died later in hospital.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged a helicopter from the Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are crushed to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death figure can rise to over a thousand people. The country’s emergency aid authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggula, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death figure is expected to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
There's little clean water.
The small markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widod arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini states that a man is missing after an aircraft crashed in a lagoon.
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific states that one is now missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and the crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were in safety.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials stated that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane slipped past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the falling planet.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he had a minor skull injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked close to developing a shipyard also helped in the rescue work using an inflatable boat to drive people on land before the plane sank in the 30 - foot - deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea for the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution ended his platter in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The American Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to puzzle the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received locational information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his previous claims, reported the newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's mobile phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed Saturday and said that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he "slow, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis some time after Chambers' death deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to begin its termination on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol feels that the hip-hop has come far from its origin in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a boost in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?!
A baby girl in New York is right because of dismissal after a "racist" text message
A baby girl in New York is a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrong text message from her mother, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the mood with "expression".
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed fear when she realized that the new baby girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEE NOT A SLEEP IGEN," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "near to fashion", and gave Maurice fired, claiming that their former child girl, who was African, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for a day's work and was sent home in a taxi.
Now she is correcting the couple to get compensation for the dismissal. She asks for compensation in the order of 350 dollars per day for the job she was initially employed to do, which would be for six months and where she would stay with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple reject the accusations that they would be racists and say that the only straight thing was to end Giselle Maurice's employment, and they were worried that they could not trust her when they had insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone whom you had been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the atmosphere with "pressurization" and said that his wife would give birth two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you want to go to such a person?
It's not very nice done," added the investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers did not believe that readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny, given what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at BBC before he got the inspiration of a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", and added that her father was proud of her final success.
"He was rather quiet by himself, and not some boastful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds with something. You get proud of the child even though it is not you who have achieved it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Even if it was his creation and his imagination, he would always give Paddington himself glory."
My daughter would die, and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the hospital of Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that one did not expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said that she would die in two minutes and that I must say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before, and now everything went out.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn't chew or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get back together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she went through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head down, and the tears ran all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but on the flight I felt overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Active women put up postcards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that can be called for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells me her son was a promising chef who had a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said that his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his siblings when he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I worry all the time about the consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been a friend of Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
"He had not said that he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that he was acting differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas presents, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says that his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to get through it. "It rips up a wound in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we all have to fight on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI initiates investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation limited in time and scope - we could perhaps get some consensus," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the Committee would "split" because of deeply rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their opposition depends entirely on the time.
The mid-year elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their efforts to have the man they want elected to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean jumpers "sunker" under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping off to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, who quotes data from South Korea's Ministry of Reunion, says that 1 127 people jumped off last year, compared to 2 706 in 2011.
Park says that tougher border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher charges to human smugglers are important causes.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Finally, most of North Korea’s jumpers are offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans are to cross the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the jumpers as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between North and South, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for talks focusing on the fast-track nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances we certainly cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying that he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The Head of Minority of the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperately inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis’s comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, she would be called 'hysterical'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the accusations that he had sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally touched, and at times he almost screamed, and the voice cried out when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the Committee, saying that the accusations against him were a "glorious and coordinated character murder" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he is partial to the detriment of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats couple," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh before national law if he was elected, and if the Democrats receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court but also to work in the court he is at now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appellation Court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was worried about what decisions Kavanaugh might take against the Health Insurance Act Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would amend certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to sit down in court and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women have to endure.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she spoke to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger in part because they are often misunderstood in essence.
One of my most clear memories of one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once cried out of indescribable anger, was that I was taken into the collar of an older woman. It was a cool boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Let them never see that you're crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry and they're happy that they managed to push you."
Mr Schroeder, who was then a democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart caught up with an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of himself standing in the presidential elections.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since she was late out, she lay behind with the fundraiser, and gave the promise not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get a total of $2 million.
It was a project condemned to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men just gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not start a formal presidential election campaign, she became so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters rather than delegates, and angered against sexism, that the vote was persevering.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalls the reaction of the press.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna write on my gravestone?"
"She cried?"
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening-up of the trade war between the United States and China was ear-absorption. The war is far from over, but the gap between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by placing important Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs duties.
The most significant step-up came this week, with new duties on goods for $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods entering the United States from China are customs-related.
Peking has each time answered with the same coin. Recently, charges of between five and ten percent were cast on US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match US action. The world's second largest economy will probably not descend within a reasonable time.
To get Washington back means to bow to demands, but to publicly crawl for the United States would be far too brilliant for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its card right, the press from the US Trade War can provide a positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to admit," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the center of New American Security.
Syria "redo" for returnees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to receive voluntary return refugees and appeals for help to build the country, which lies in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism", he said.
The government continues to build up the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and survival.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome the help of rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it did not receive conditional support or help from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe joined Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutively on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the impact on the 16th hole par 3-ban, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari smiled in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever done 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was struck out 5 & 4 by the lowest rated player of the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top rated player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
This is about the team, and I am glad that I could help," said a touched Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He passed over the stickstick to his countryman John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2/1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I am grown up looking at him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all their four games in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for their career in Ryder cup.
A strange statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who have won 14 major titles, which has only been exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
The American captain Jim Furyk said after the team's discouraging performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
The hat's off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the US PGA Tour and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to bow and knock.
They played better than us."
Algal flower: The levels decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from Florida's Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in algal bloom concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, olive flowers are reported in the areas around the large municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The algal flower extends along over 20 miles of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Flies can be seen about a mile and a half out of the sea outside the large municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algal flowering has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations within or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations on or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the large municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida that past week.
