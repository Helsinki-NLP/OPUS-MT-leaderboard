Crying to the World
The market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland is a great start and shout and call out in nature has begun to pull people wide and wide around the world.
“ You own the collage, I need Iceland, ” says one woman in the big world in comments about a commercial campaign commercial campaign Look Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another viewer will keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman will say she has to get to Iceland as soon as possible, for her beloved is settled there.
On the other hand, in the United States, she is unhappy and assumes that she will have to wait a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the route to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
It's not gonna follow the story if he comes from another time zone.
Egil Thordorson of the advertising room Pelel, who came to produce the advertisements together with the international advertising room M&C Saatchi, says that there has been more hope.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigners that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already coming to an end.
In essence, this is about creating a PR value, that's getting foreign media to deal with the campaign, and it's been amazingly successful.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received a review of some seven hundred worldwide media, a total of over two billion people.
The value of this review is worth $1.8 billion.
It's not boring."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well, even though the Americans are not on their way to the country.
According to Egil, known markets such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also responded favorably, one of Russia’s most pleasant surprises.
There have been reactions from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically addressed.
“ These advertisements have traveled far and wide, ” says Eric, who may have looked at the material on YouTube by more than four million people.
“ We couldn’t have wanted a better start. ”
The pictures here on the opening took Årni Sæberg, the photographer of the morning newspaper, to take the advertisements that carry the cover “Let It Out” in the middle of the last month.
The roofs were wide and wide, as in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjöra, at Skogarfos, in the plain of Solheim, and in the cave at Hjörlevshød.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki the son of Peter and Gunnar Paul the son of Ólaf with the Scots of production and captured the son of Ottar Godna.
Roles in this area included the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
At the same time as recordings were made in South Africa, there was another group in West and West France.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is aimed at a winter campaign in cooperation with M&C Saatchi.
“ This is just the first phase of this work for Iceland’s Office, ” says Eric, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi was very successful.
“ Working with them is great.
In such tasks, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Exploding: discuss the position in the labour market, pension for life and many more
Ásmund, Minister for Social Affairs and Childhood, is in Sprengisand, which starts at ten o'clock today.
He is also Minister for Labour and discusses the position in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other matters.
He also discusses rural matters and transportation work on land that has been poorly divided over the past few years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of VR, will also be involved, but he will discuss his criticisms about investments in pension funds and will present ideas that workers’ movements and professionals will withdraw from the fund’s government to reduce the risk of conflict of interests.
Then they will be discussed with Ivar Ingimarsson, a traveling servant in Austria, and Årnheiði Jonnsdóttir, director of the North-West Market, on the state of travel services in the countryside.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if the summer’s success is a misleading excuse for what to come.
You can listen to the feature below, but it starts at ten o’clock.
That's what she looks like today 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in youth.
Yet, World Story was given to her for her game as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
Then she also played in the fractions of Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
However, she had to look over the road and express herself on Clueless on a loving TV during the daytime.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“ I have to admit that I based my person most on girls I met at school who were not good with me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
I didn't want to leave the police station after the nightguest.
About 50 cases came on the board of the police in the capital area today, saying in the police journal that the situation was varied.
The day at the police station in Qefsgata began with the fact that a police officer had to deal with a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there because of a drunk driving.
If the man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the instructions of a police officer who told him to leave.
The man continued to stay at the police station because of his progress.
At that time, a man was arrested in the morning year suspected of breaking into a company in Kopavogi.
A police force also had to be replaced by two men in Breithol because of reports of assault.
At that time, a woman sitting at a shopping mall in Kopavogi was unable to pay for the bill after a meal and was therefore called to the police.
The car was also reported to be stolen in the middle of town this morning.
A white Renault driver looked at her for a while and was then taken out of hand.
The car has not been found.
The Profanation of the Joyful Army — The Horrible Destiny of the Glee Stars
That theory has reached a flight on the Internet that curses the game of joy, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California during the day and thus became the third major player of the scenes to give life long before age.
The happy group (e.g. Glee) is a popular performance in singing, dancing, and joy.
The scenes discussed the so - called joyary group of youths in high school, their love and fate.
It was not always the custom to be in the joyful company, but through singing and dancing, the characters seemed to overcome any situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the scenes, great calamities have been waging over the players and the employees of the events, so much so that theories have awakened that curses lie on the factors.
Naya Marie Rivera took the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who didn't call all his grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went to have the actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against his husband and then separated.
Dorsey, however, refused to file a complaint and had the problem of domestic violence fallen.
On July 8, last, Rivera was reported missing after her four - year - old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Pira, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a lifejacket on board the boat and could tell the police authorities that he and his mother had sunk and then Rivera had brought him back into the boat but never returned there.
Extensive search for Rivera was raised.
On the day after the search, the local police officer reported that we were looking for Rivera’s drowning.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially declared dead.
It is thought to have been in a lot of current in the water, and the last requirement to save the son is new.
The cause of death was reported drunk by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took on the role of Finn Hudson in the role of the American footballer with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Joy Team to justice and respect.
Yet, outside the scenes, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
Since his 13 - year - old, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his associates were sufficiently involved, involved, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed to look better.
Only two months after completing treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamen was found to be a deadly mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered that there was a will.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerability for administration had been reduced to such an extent that the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his fellow workers, but in harmony with his Adversary, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking part and dedicated them to the memory of Moneith and Finn’s person.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the scenes, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Joy Team, or all until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles suspected of child abuse.
At his house, he found a huge amount of child pornography, and the matter was soon asked out publicly.
It was clear that Salling had already been here.
He was then accused and convicted of his transgressions.
He had four to seven years ’ imprisonment, as well as the need to be on a list of sexual offenders and to seek treatment for child greed.
Before determining the penalty, a judge named Salling, who was then released from insurance, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
In 2013, he was in a state of early sleep, only 41 years of age.
At the same time, a woman named Nancy Motes worked.
She was a younger sister of the big star Julia Roberts, and she did not carry her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Robert of a great deal of control and disrespectful conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she faced severe depression.
She left a letter to her beloved, where she called her mother and sister responsible for her situation.
“ My mother and my so - called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that they caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the events.
She has recently been accused of using her compatriots to take a take - place crossing and of having a superior star girl.
Jesse Luken took part in the 2012 events.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which seemed to be a great scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the events.
In 2010, she found that unscrupulous computer threshings got into nude pictures of her and published on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played in both the games and had an affair outside the games.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything.
It increases children’s maturity when they are allowed to play in a garden with their parents to grow flowers and watch them grow and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with the children in the garden is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the perfume, and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat in 10th grade
“I don’t think we’re many sailors working in the country’s games schools, ” says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, who is fishing in the sea in summer, but is studying psychology at the University of Iceland over winter times. ”
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have good money, and I enjoy being able to avoid taking a loan.
The income also makes me well into the winter," says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, 25-year-old psychology student, who is fishing for shores in summer like the last summer.
Axel was the latest brewer on the Tálknådur when a journalist spoke of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The 10th grade witness I took a ship’s license for boats under 12 feet [12 m] long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished primary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat from my acquaintance, the son of Hartmann, and called the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat at three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer, but the other half at the end of summer when I had been fishing.
So I had the boat without debt at the end of this first summer of mine on it."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished primary school?
“ I had already laid down and collected money; I had been working with my father at sea when I was a boy; I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my percolation money in my boat fund."
Axel is born in Isapharid, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Copavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can fish here in the western area because I have a legal home with my grandmother in Isafarde.
I learned in these areas here west of the rowing with my dad.
I move from far to far, according to how I feel, for this fishing area covers all the West.
Although I feel that it is best to be westward, I have also given around the snowfall and beyond.
I have also given for the south, but preferably a gap," says Axel, who always starts one fire in the morning and sometimes says he talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, in private hours together in the ball sea.
“ The Internet at sea is good, so I can call, listen to a video show and music.
I don't think it's a good thing to be alone on a boat.
Of course I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly occasionally something has been going on, but never much danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seaick.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing is going.
“ I’m never more than 14 hours fishing at once, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the taxi lot, but then I’ve been stuck for a day and a half in the bait out on the sea fishing. ”
The arrangement in beach fishing says that he can catch 770 pounds a day, which he feels is blocking.
“ Other restrictions are that I may not be fishing Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I may only be fishing 12 days a month, during the four months of sea fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my view, sailors should choose their fishing days after weather and nothing else.
Instead of having 48 days throughout the summer, this unnecessary pressure is needed to calm down, and it can choose its head.
So the land change could also go for me, and the seams that are well located at the fish farm should enjoy it," says Axel, who pulls most cod out of the seawaters on his shore fishing, but also only afs and some other species float with them.
Axel works over the wintertime with the university at Nupi School in Kopavogi.
“ I don’t think we’re many sailors who work at the country’s playgrounds, ” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only going to work temporarily at the playground.
“ I get stuck there because I think this is a great job.
I hope that my psychology course will benefit me at the high school level in the future," says Axel, who also has a long history in business science.
An error in the register prevented a return randomity
An error in a registration form that people fill out when they come to the country caused a person, who was resident in this country, not to be called back into vision.
It is not necessary to record the identification number if the person fills the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
“ This will be examined during the week, ” says a specialist in a land doctor’s field of disease.
Three domestic infections were detected in the National Antiquology Department yesterday.
One person who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after rules on return myths became effective.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened at the arrival of the land and again preached in vision four to five days later.
In the lunch news of RUV, however, it was noted that the person had followed the old system.
The sampling on the border was negative and was not called back to screening for the virus.
Kamilla Ruth Sigfusdóttir, an expert in the field of disease protection, says in a conversation with a news office that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic record sheet.
If people fill in the registration form in English, the identification number as in the Icelandic version is not required.
For the most part, it has been thought of for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the subject has not been automatically invited to show.
However, despite the fact that they have filled the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been alert to revisiting people after they arrived in the country.
“ This will be examined during the week how to make it easier for people to access them to draw their attention to the process. ”
The man is in isolation, and six have been put into an emergency.
They all go on vision, but two had already shown symptoms.
Smuggling is now in progress with the three infections detected yesterday, largely due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequencing of the Islenian genetic analysis has shown that there are variants of the crown virus that have not been found here before.
In another case, the bond has focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who moved the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says there should be a place tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now isolated according to the website COVID. is.
135 are in a condition.
Four out of five non-connected infections
Five domestic infections have been detected in this country in recent days.
Of these, four people are unconnected and are to form the source of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup sports convention yesterday.
Slipping is still ongoing.
Originally, at the age of 30, they were sent to the hospital, which was reduced to 16.
In total, 34 are infected by these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is a second time in a short period of time, and it has raised questions as to whether such an event should be held.
John K. Jonsson, Head of Communications at the National Police Department, says that it is very slow, as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
“ We are constantly inculcating to all those who live here that there is a need for individual protection.
We also need to make it clear to people who are observing events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
Then you can keep an event," says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping up with individual infectious diseases.
In addition, rules and criteria are under constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what the National Guard and the National Medical Agency are constantly invigorating to people, is to consider these individual infections.
Both at home and at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from going on," says John.
“ We need to encourage people to continue on the good road we were on in order to maintain the results we have to date. ”
40% of victims of COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard on her walking phone how difficult her father was to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, and she urged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
Death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronary virus infection.
Diabetes were identified as the underlying cause of death, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is afraid that the same thing will happen.
Reuter's news agency says Brumfield's fear doesn't go without reason.
A recent study by the U.S. authorities has shown that less than 40% of those who died had diabetes 2 as their underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion increases to half.
A study of the American Center for Disease Control (CDC) included over 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the crown virus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, an expert in CDC infectious diseases, says that the results are striking, especially for those who have diagnosed diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
The slow growth of Reuters was included in the survey, pointing the answers from the 12 countries that corresponded to comparable proportions.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet reported underlying diseases.
“ Diabetes was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now COVID—19 has broken through like a powerful age," has Reuters, by Elbert Huang, president of the Centre for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes are more common among blacks and people of southern American origin, who have also gone worse out of the crown virus.
One of the best defenses for people with diabetes 2 is to keep their disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and the help of healthcare professionals.
However, the crown epidemic has made it difficult for many to keep a bus.
In this way, insulin prices have forced some people to keep coming to work and thus stop being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risks that people with diabetes 2 may have from the virus.
When the SARS crown virus was passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and in 2009 this group was at three times more likely to have to enter a hospital.
In 2012, when MRS did so, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus may have been prolonged, the danger may have taken away the cover of a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’ll see a flood wave of problems when it’s over,” says Andrew Bolton, president of the international group of diabetics.
Doctors have warned that the coronary artery epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and renal excretion.
Similarly, new studies are directed so that the crown virus may lead to an increase in diabetic cases.
Reuters says that scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the crown virus and diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high glucose and lipid ratio in diabetics can induce a true “cell signalworm, ” as it is called when the immune system responds too hard and attacks the body.
Impaired endothelial cells may also lead to inflammatory formation which may in turn lead to fatal blood clots.
“ It’s all one big puzzle game, ” says Dela Cruz.
"It's all connected to the inside."
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited champagne, so they left the room."
The wife Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason became the unusual request from the artist Ragnari Kjartans son to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was setting up in Paris.
“ We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated. ”
So atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and grandmother, Ásruna Magnúsdóður.
“ I was very impressed with her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but so did I.
And I'm still sorry," he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, but the husband regularly rendezvouses the first meeting.
“ I always hear that story.
Last weekend alone," she says, who was also attracted to the husband at first sight.
“ I felt and feel so much excitement around Atla, which I like.
There is much going on and much going on, and I was delighted with it."
Atli says that she and her wife have stressed the importance of taking their own steps.
“ We don’t tie our backs to the same knots as coworkers.
"We're avoiding the rutines that we're looking around."
It is possible that they took the matter from Ragnari Kjartan’s son, an artist, was just gratifying, although it would be most unusual.
“ Christian Anna, a friend of ours, contacts us and asks if we can come to eat deserts with him, Ragga and Ingibjörgu, Ragnar’s wife, on Snakes. ”
They accepted the invitation, met the triplicate on Snaps, and got a desert wine and their desserts.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for a visual show he intended to set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris, during the fall.
“ He had a multi-channeled video project called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Ásrún says that he described the work as a fatal and dekadent late from the everyday lives of Westerners.
“ He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot, and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating. ”
Senan, of whom Ragnar asked the couple to participate, was to show a young pair to love in a minimal room.
“ These are first - and - last sexes, ” says Atli.
The couple did not know much about Ragnar, even though they knew about him, “but they knew us and felt fit in this.
They had words that they did not want to advertise people.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who would get sexual exploitation from performing to others."
They needed Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take long.
“ When we walked out of Snaps, we said: ‘ Are we not just here?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and his entire team," says Ásrún and Atli.
"This is about love and neighboring."
Senan was taken to a nice apartment on the Myrgate.
There was a very small film team; the cameraman, Ragnar, and a soundman and the pair.
After a recording had been set on fire, everyone left the room to wait in the car, except for Atli and Ásrún.
“ We had not decided what we should be like.
We got some guidance, but we tried to forget about time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and of who we were doing.
There was nothing played, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
“ Yes, it was a bit romantic, ” says Atli and Ásrún.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved them.
“ When Tommi took a look at this, he cried, and he thought it was so beautiful, ” says Atli.
“ It’s about love and neighboring as much as the social association itself, ” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents have seen the work, and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in the son of Reykjavík, who realized that he was part of it.
“ Then she turns around and starts to think about it, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, "It's nice to run into the little family in Palais de Tokyo," rips up Ásrún.
And would participation in the work have deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atla?
“ At least we’re still together, so maybe it deepened.
At least this deepened my relationship with the related family," says Ásrún and laugh.
Ásrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I found it a little difficult not to be with you, but with someone else, ” she says, turning to her husband.
“ But it was nice to see this because it’s only one late in a much bigger job, and when you saw it with the other effects, it’s really cool.
I could break away a little bit from this and I was just proud.
And there was a little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant by the other child of the couple when the seine was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibl Claus talked to the Australians and Atla in the history of Love at Ras 1.
Swansea with a win in the first kick-off game
Swansea won a 1-0 victory at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the team in the playoffs to get to the English selection department.
The game went to Swansea’s hometown in Wales.
The half-time position was 0-0.
The people of Swansea got a hell of a 64th minute, while Andre Ayew failed the archalith from the point of view and had it protected.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a player of Brentford, got the red card.
Brentford, therefore, played the rest of the game fewer, and in 82 minutes, Swansea’s new players joined him.
Andre Ayew made up the vitreous by scoreing a great goal and securing Swansea 1–0 victory.
So Swansea leads from 1 to 0 in the competition, but the second game takes place on the next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Ambassador-free for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. Ambassador of Iceland, has been blaming the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard in fear of his life.
However, the President of the United States has not gone unrestrainedly to appoint an ambassador in this country.
Since the end of April 2009, Carol Van Voorst’s office as ambassador of the United States was no longer a ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office under peculiar circumstances, but Kastlyn reported in 2009 that she should have been given the Falkato.
On the way to a greeting meeting with Iceland’s president, she received a call from the president’s office that she would not be honoured.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
In September 2010, 16 months passed until Van Voorst’s successor arrived.
Some reason is that Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador but then stopped.
At last, Loius Ariega had served in foreign service for decades.
In the fall of 2013, he gave up his duties and received the office of ambassador of Guatemala.
At that time another ambassador-free period took place.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015, and soon thereafter, no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not diplomite, but he had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama’s election fund.
He left office as Donald Trump received the presidency office, January 20, 2017, as the custom of political ambassador.
Trump’s government was unusual for both ambassadors and senior officials in the Washington system.
So two years passed until the U.S. Congress announced to Jeffrey Ross Gunter at his meeting to ask him for help and confirm after that as an ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony to Congress he said he never came to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who was dead, had been of Dutch rock broken.
Gunter, a political physician in California, was a former dermatologist and has been prominent in the Jewish organization of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The gambling owner Sheldon Adelson set them up, but Adelson is an eager supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been on the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest thing in the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s government was to appoint people in key offices, and that in recent years the U.S. Parliament’s work has been very slow, including the confirmation of ambassadors in office.
Since 2009, there have been no ambassadors in Iceland for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the operation of the Council of Ambassadors, which recently opened headquarters at Engageigeg.
The operations are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the clusters of safety walls are surrounded by the building, and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
It does not seem to have enough to fill the present ambassador with a sense of security, for he is said to be afraid of his life and has wanted an armed guard.
IBV's former player suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former player of IBV, claims that when he was in Iceland, he was exposed to racism and regrets his arrival in the country.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny, which appeared on the U.S. Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Ugandan Police FC team in the top division of Uganda.
During the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time here in the country, which he played with IBV, Val, and Evolution in Iceland.
“ When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The leader of the team was in that position, but in addition, he also had the shirt number that I wanted so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right edge of the season with IBV.
Among the things Tonny talks is racism that he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“ This once happened to me, but since I did not understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He told me then that my opponent had a racist speech against me after I took him away."
In 2014, Tonny from Iceland went to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
It says that he made the most of the mistakes he sees.
Tonny had not been able to get to Haugesund’s starting team, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on a loan, but he joined Val.
“ It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on a loan.
I think if I had been longer in Norway then I would have had the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway he would probably get further.
He would like to say that the loan to Iceland has destroyed his dreams of getting into a big place in Europe.
Find a worm in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch black snake in the neck gland of a woman who was looking for it.
Doctors were able to pull the worm out with a stick.
A study revealed that parasites were involved.
CNN reports this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, which is a thin piece of meat.
The woman soon improved after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi fell to bed in the West, cases involving parasites have increased, according to CNN.
Fear that other waves are starting in Europe
Spain is now in a burning position to worry about another wave of the crown virus in Europe, where governments have taken steps to reintroduce the crown virus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where infection is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action because of the proliferation of infectious diseases in Spain, but in Britain all have to go to the hospital at the return from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned about travel to Spain.
It is also growing in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between the spread of the virus and the return of economic life.
However, the European situation is good in other parts of the world, but the incidence of world-wide infections is approaching 300 000 a day, with the highest rates being found in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infection has become 16 million worldwide, according to John Hopkins University’s estimate, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus are 644 thousand.
Moscaic Works Are at last to Enjoy Their Fullest
In front of the Tollhouse in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
In the top of it are men with orange helmets.
There's a big grave, too.
And more of my machines.
The street is closed before traffic.
But the sidewalks are good, and many of them are now standing by and respecting the works of millions of mosaics — as they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least they did not respect it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it was a parking lot that was always surrounded.
People lay there, locked the car in a quick hurry, and then jumped into their business in the city center.
"Leverable and diverse public space" and "accommodating cities" provide guidance on the redesign of the current Safe Sea.
The goal is to beauty the area and allow the mosaic work of Ger Helgadóttir at the Tollhuset to enjoy a better view.
In front of the job there will be a square and where the area is well with the sun, it is thought to be suitable as a sleeping area for road users.
The work of art will be described and now the wood will enjoy itself better than before on this 142 - square - meter surface.
In the area, there will also be small “thumbles, ” some kinds of water sculptures that offer and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by the City of Reykjavík, which is currently being carried out with Vetum.
Water supply, heat and electric power supply will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but the schools and cold water have since 1925, so they have served in the middle - town homes and businesses for almost a century.
Once the street is reopened, cars can drive it again.
Yet, it becomes a one - way street, and at the same time it creates a calmer and accessible space for walking.
A study of the Toll House on the customs office says that the house was used in 1971, whose architect was Gisli Halldorsson.
Because the docks reached through the house, there were 250 square feet [250 m] of windowless surfaces forming into the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such surfaces would have a bad effect on the overall street image if no special arrangements were made to decorate the layout of the house.
Thus, the members agreed to be calculated by having a permanent work of art set up there.
At that time, much of Gerdé Helgadóttir, an artist, said in the summary.
Had she worked hard on mosaic works in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was to contact her first before deciding whether to compete for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the port, since the port had been a lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was made.
When she was discussed with the artist, she had to take a look at such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, where she would work with the suggestions abroad.
When she returned home, she made a few suggestions for discussion.
She was immediately agreed to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, it was desired to make an overall agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Oidtmann brothers, but had long worked with them to set up famous works throughout Europe.
Contracts were concluded and made to work under the organization of the brothers ’ workshop, who then arranged for the Toll House.
The whole work was very well solved, both by the Helgadaught and by the Oidtmann brothers, says in the summary.
Ever since then, it has been able to withstand a soft Icelandic weather.
It took him about two years to do the work that was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Toll House work was finished, just 47 years old.
Preparing to transfer more institutions to shore
Ásmund Ásmund Ásmund Einar Dandason, Minister for Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be transferred to the country in the near future.
That's what the minister of the show was saying.
Recently, it was reported that the fires of the National Institute of Housing and Men’s Works will be carried north in the fall of Saudárkrok.
Six fires experts work at the Agency, but none of them intend to follow the North Institute and have a national community of fire-fighting and paramedics criticised the transportation of motor vehicles.
“ I think we should take further steps in this creature.
I'm preparing further steps in this creature.
More transport," said Ásmundur.
Is he convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions around the country?
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to the country, as I was doing with the National Institute of Housing and Humanities,” said Ásmundur, who also took an example of the other institutions that have been transferred to the country and played a major role in communities in the country, such as the transfer of Food Institutes to Selfoss, the Landmarks of Iceland to Akranes, and unemployment insurance on Skagaststrand.
All the most important from the second day of Champion
94. Iceland’s Free Sports Championship ended in Thorsväld, Akureyri, today.
Some conventions were held on the second day of the race.
An exciting competition was calculated in the dynasty of women in Thorsfield, while Vigdius Jonsdóttir from FH placed Icelandmet in a slumbering throw in 2014 until Elizabeth Rut Rúnarsdóttir from IR added the estimate in May of last year.
Vigdis won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in fantastical form lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record for what is summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injury and has not recovered today.
She had only one valid cast of five, threw 25,69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdis threw the longest of all today, or 60,08 meters in her last attempt, and at the same time set an assembly mark.
In July, her Icelandic record was 62,69 feet [62,69 m] away from it.
The guru of Karita’s Hallgrim daughter from IR had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best success by throwing up to 50,18 meters.
In a male class, the FH man Hilmar Eagle Ionsson, a Icelandic meth in a caste, won a safe victory, and he threw 73.84 meters in his next final cast and set an assembly mark.
His Icelandic record in this article is 75,26 meters.
Gudni Valur Gudnason, Olympian, and Icelandic Meths in the roundaboutst, won a ballcast on Thorsland yesterday, but today he competed in the roundaboutst, which is his main article.
The Icelandic god Vals was 65.5 feet [65.53 m] but he threw a maximum of 59.13 feet [59.13 m] today and secured his victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second extension today, but he had one valid pitch that would last for the second seat of 49,43 metres.
Havdí’s Victory, a long - range Icelandic meth, won the long - distance competition with superiority, while Havdí’s jumped a maximum of 6.25 metres today, which is nearly 40 cm from its Icelandic meth.
In the 200 - foot [200 m] race of women, it was the IR king Godbjörg Jona Bjarnadóttir, who was the fastest in 24.04 seconds, whose Icelandic record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Jonah’s God - given salvation was triumphant in Akureyri, who won two gold prizes yesterday, in a 100 - foot race, and in a 4 x 100 - foot race, and then in a 4 x 400 - foot [400 - foot] race today.
In a male class, the Kolbeinn Hörn of Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 - foot race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before the oliver Måna Samuels son of the Year.
Like God’s Björg Jonah, the Kolbehn won the Horde of gold in the 100 - foot [100 m] yesterday as well as in the 400 - foot [400 m] race.
Cannot get a fine for $27 million Bitcoin crop
The Excesses Committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who demanded a fine for neglecting his financial details that were made for the sale of Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not given a clear explanation as to why it was necessary to punish the man.
The committee's decision states that the tax investigator considered that the man had a place to deliver material wrong tax contributions for the financial years 2016 and 2017.
He would have underestimated his financial stakes that had been made for the sale of Bitcoin at 27 million, either on purpose or out of great shepherding.
The guilty man would be guilty of his tact.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, in 2016, he was able to sell electric coins for 27 million.
In 2009 and 2010, he would have obtained graves when they had both been easy and cheap with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the coins, the tax would have been very vague and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that public citizens would recognize such measures in tax talks.
He would not have avoided paying taxes on the harvest and would have recognized his property as a substitute for a currency account.
He would have asked both the experts and the tax commissioner about how this would be done but without success.
Then he thought that he would have to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had lived here for only a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
So he would have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have made a clear view of.
The man considered it right that his taxes for these two income years would be reoriented and strained, but otherwise no punishment would be imposed.
Then he repeated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes here in the country since 2012.
He would never have intended to escape his duties in an inappropriate way.
The demand for guilt would be out of the way and would put him in debt.
A son of a bitch's talk is, "This man understands what football is"
A great deal has been done between the teeth of Andersen Willumsson, who has also been impressed by his progress as a result of what is a playtime in the Pepsi Max division.
The flashes will be on the fire line tonight when they receive the IA on a live broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
They are outlawed because of four reminders during the season, and they do not come to play with new clippings, such as in summer’s games to date.
He had been “blah, blah, blah” on his head before the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“ I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but talking about the character, this one was better trying in the game.
He didn't go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every time, and if there was someone going to equal this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Gudmund Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max bar, when thought to hit the Brynjólf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ It’s hard sometimes to figure out where he is.
He's looking out a little bit on the left when it starts to pass, but he's got a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Hafjonason.
Thorkell Måni Petersson says that Brynjólf is a real entertainer, and he rejoices to have such a colorful man in the department: “No one agrees that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and being always ready to come and answer interviews.
There's an amazing amount of people involved in him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“ I’m a entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying themselves in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moni.
A KR player says he wants to leave the partner - "I've been in touch with some teams in B Division"
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in Pepsi Max, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Soccer.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the start of the period in his country, but for this, he first has to cancel his contract with the KR, where the Danish branch begins before that Icelandic chance.
The Society knows that I miss Denmark and have shown me much understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“ I’ve been in contact with several teams in the B division, and I’m likely to change before the end of the Icelandic period.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay up my contract with the KR."
Then he says that he is likely to face a reduction in wages in Denmark.
"Feeds in Denmark have probably felt more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
The biker Bjartmar has recovered a bike for millions - is now responding to a review of the DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leosson has had a different hobby from most others.
He climbs up and saves lost and stolen rides, electric wheels, and vesicles.
Has Bjartmar won the name “the wheelwalker” for the time being?
Yesterday, when you published an account of your relationship with Bjartmar, there was so much feathering.
DV then referred to a discussion on a Facebook group of Westerners, where it was noted that Björn had taken the man to the Eastfield and said that the beast might be stolen.
Could not read from the original writings of the electrician, but the fact that Bjartmar had known him as a thief.
These texts have now been changed to Facebook and the headline of the original DV news updated accordingly.
Bright says that the original news of the matter does not describe what was really going on yesterday in Eastern England.
Lights said that they had received information from victims of electrical shocks that they were indeed their electric shocks.
This information was provided by the alleged owner, but the information was found to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I was familiar with the shuttle, with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was looking for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him prepare to drive off on the shuttle, I decided to knock on the man.
The owner was certain of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I do very well in such matters, but before I finished what I had to say, the man had taken away the word."
The Bjartmar says that the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the wheel and himself called the police.
“ Yeah, cool, ” said Bjartmar, “let’s just get this straight. ”
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and started.
Later, as reported in the previous story, the right owner of the electronics told us about his history on Facebook.
In this over - a - year period of his practice, Bjartmar says that he can count the times he encountered with people on his fingertips.
“ I’ve had a peaceful relationship with the most difficult men in Reykjavík, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are most often the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, addicts, depressed people, and other people who are on the street for some reason.
“ The figs are a hard master, and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, and unfortunately theft is a easy way to reach that goal, ” says Bjartmar.
“ My dealings with these people are really so good that I have many of the good people with me.
There are examples of people going to treatment and taking care of themselves and then looking to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bratmar’s communication with bicycle workers is polite.
Some know of him and what he is doing and are peacefully offering to show him receipts, numbers of wheels, and so on.
Theft of bicycles is a major problem that has not been discussed.
In addition, Bratmar says that the police have even begun to direct people to talk to them on the basis of stolen bicycles.
Lights are displeased with the previous DV news, and they say that they are not some sort of self - ordered police force in personal pursuit of justice.
Asked whether he is now not on his own ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, says Bjartmar indeed be.
“ Of course, the police have to do this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.
I've been looking up at policemen driving away from a big pile of stolen wheels.
She's clean and unbearable in these matters."
“ When the cops aren’t doing anything about this, and it’s just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can achieve success in this category, why not? ” says Bjartmar.
He says that he has achieved so much success in having stolen wheels, that sometimes he stumbles on his “scrollers” on the street that then they only had the right Brightmar bikes they had previously recovered.
The times Bjartmar has called for police help have caused her simply not to be present.
“ It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the bikes to blame,” said Bjartmar, and I’m sorry that victims of bicycle thieves have to suffer from the indifference of the police in this category.
On the success of Bjartmar, there is no dispute.
In many places, stories of people can be found thanks to the Bjartmar for having reached them again.
In fact, the number of bicycles he has returned has been lost for a long time, but the amounts will probably run in millions, if not millions.
Road there is a heavy load of electricity, electric wheels, and electric shuttles, but it can cost up to half a million.
As a matter of fact, it is a matter of day, and every other weekend, he works in a community.
So his ride is an unpaid job he spends in his spare time.
Life insurance and long shadows
In 2019 there was a big birthday in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
True, from the 19th century C.E. onward, officials had received a pension from King Dana, but in 1919 a pension fund was set up for civil servants who eventually became a pension fund for all public employees.
The basis for the current pension fund of general wage earners was then laid by a global distribution of core contracts in the labour market in 1969, where employment-related pension fund was requested with a commitment and a valid fund collection from the 1970s.
In 1974 laws were then laid down on the basis of these agreements, and the life - care system continued to grow thereafter.
The economic system of wage earners was not the only radical change that the 20th - century workers’s movement caused by their nuclear struggle.
In 1955, unemployment insurance had been provided in a similar way in historical strikes, and the organization gradually met its demands for sickness and health insurance, significant leave rights, reduced working hours, housing improvements, and other important changes.
All these rights involved a great and rigorous struggle, but after thinking, there was much more and more lasting improvement than the increase in wages, which disappeared just as rapidly in the heat of inflation that characterized the postwar period until 1990 as many remember.
In 1969, the entrant to the establishment of a public pension fund was both long and complex.
Although they finally agreed that the funds would actually be the property of society, the labor movement agreed that their governments had to be appointed representatives of professional and social partners alike.
In the next few years after the fund organisation, the requirement for the majority of employees in the fund management was often discussed in the employee organization, but it never worked out, and so we still have the unusual arrangement that representatives of the fund managers are not in the majority of the fund management.
Article 36 of Law No 129/1997 on the insurance of pension rights and the operation of pension funds discusses the investment policy of the funds.
It says in the first century that “a pension for life should guide the interests of society. ”
In addition, the fifth part says: “A pension for living will set a moral standard for investments. ”
Among the following provisions are part of the Live Eyrisfond Act, followed by the above-mentioned legal provisions:
The National Security Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and professionally established Western and European companies.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as on good governance, can contribute to improving the investment performance of stocks.
This brings together the interests of investors and society’s goals in a wider context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those registered in stock markets, take public policy on: to have a good governance of social responsibility and environment.
The National Pension Fund, Gildi, has set itself “a policy of responsible investments, ” and there are similar regulations.
This is all reminiscent here as the introduction to the latest fashion word of the Icelandic, "shadow control".
Since the word is new in this case, it is not hoped that it has been clearly defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now “most taken”: Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he is going to send representatives of the Society in the direction of a pension fund or instructions on how to take a position on a particular matter.
If they fail to comply with the recommendations, they will be expelled from the government at first convenience.
If, however, the leader does not carry this in the media and does not speak of termination, it is not “shadow control, ” for of course, communication between humans is always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about the way in which he feels “brighter. ”
In particular, there are two men who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
It's a tough Ägisson journalist on the Newspaper and Ásgeir Jonsson's banker.
After Bogi Nils Bogason’s president, Icelandir, who had announced his intention to conclude the agreements with the Society with Air Forces and Air Forces, Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of the Reykjavíkov Association, sent them out to the representative of the Society in the management of the Life-Eyris Fund merchants not to support the fund’s potential purchase of shares in the Society, they would not be allowed to be replaced.
Later, Bogi Nil made his decision back, and after that, Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which, of course, was based on Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw a harsh and Ásgeir reason to comment on the matter in the Friday newspaper of the News, saying a great deal about shadow control, law offences, and the need for changes in laws.
There was certainly a small duvet to speculate on a heavy load, even though the blessed duvet had been connected and was wiped out quickly.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter at the end.
I set out before this point in the law of a pension fund that is subject to this matter.
These include that government agencies should take care of the interests of society and have moral criteria for investment, and these elements are further implemented in the approved both Gildis and the Life Eyris Fund of traders, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only at short-term profits in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy and would not have to look for long - term examples of it in the past, since large loans to banks and lakes have gone to immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
The chairman of Icelandir was obviously on high ice when he thought about wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill that the Society has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he looked at himself and pulled it back.
Time shows whether it is enough for the investment in pension funds in the partner to be held accountable to society at the end of the day.

One of the infected did not have a return mystery
One of the three identified with Covid-19 on the land yesterday came to the country from the Baltic State on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelandic, however, who is not regularly resident here, and was therefore not given clear instructions to carry out a so - called return myth after arriving in the country and to take another sample a few days after his arrival.
He got a negative screening at the border.
“ But he’s in a Icelandic community, and he’s actually going to go on that resource,” says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, a specialist in the field of disease protection at Land doctor’s and the substitute of a disease protection doctor while he’s on vacation, in a conversation with the Newspaper today.
“ He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to record the identification number, and if the identifier is not registered, you are not automatically announced in the second view. ”
She says that man could have used the English registration form because he was actually a foreign resident, but because of his connection to the country he was supposed to use it as an Icelandic.
But he didn't realize it.
“ When the identiary is not registered, you have to seek it yourself in the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that this was the right way," says Kamilla.
“ It is clear, then, that while we find some way to make an automatic preaching system, we need to further our information, even though Iceland does not register its identification number.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system," it explains.
Luckily, however, the person was in close contact with the country even though he was defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, a Icelander.
Only six have been sent to the hospital after he was diagnosed yesterday, and all six were associated with him.
They're going to take a sample, but two of them have already shown signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received negative results from his vision at the border on July 15.
Kamilla is likely to say that he was recently infected with the virus that she was not yet detected when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the fact that the man has been infected in Iceland but has not carried the virus to the country.
“ It is not quite possible to claim that it is safely imported because it has been a long time since he came to the country that he may have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little control in connection with the sports conventions. ”
Yet, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
“ It’s really very unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but states that it cannot be excluded until the identification of the virus in the human being has been separated.
“ If we have a type of virus that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he has carried it to the country. ”
Piper sprays and bombs against Protestants
There was a conflict between the police and Protestants in Seattle last night.
While Protestants were using peppers and unbanished bombs, Protestants broke a window and set fire.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 policemen were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one Protestant was shot to death.
As noted in the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a building site and broke a window in the city’s courthouse.
The protest police then said that the protests were alarmed, and there was a conflict between protesters and police.
Claiming justice in Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man who was murdered by a policeman last August, was the least of Protestants.
A car drove through a Protestant group in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of national guards came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman who was murdered by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms, and they marched to the gates where the police were required by a group of protesters who also carried firearms.
At that time, 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white barowner in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the football leader Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game at Leicester today on the final tour of the English Selection Department.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, the Solskjær and his men end up in the fifth seat and thereby lose the Championship seat.
However, they should still hope to get to the Masters' Division by winning the European Union next month.
“ We have not come to an end point.
If we reach a stage against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad period," said Solskjær.
“ But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, because we still have a lot of land to catch up with the two teams above us, ” said Solskjær.
Clearly, the nerves of humans get thin at 3: 00 p.m. today, while Sunshine tried to pretend that each other game was involved.
“ If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure during the last game of the season.
It's nothing new, and on it is the company.
We've made a great opportunity to end the period well and now it's ours to use it," said Solskjær.
“ This isn’t the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football game, the next game is always the most important one.
The conclusion does not define our period; we have already had many hours to define this period."
“ The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us, and I believe that we are completely better in shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last period, ” said Solskjær.
65,000 transmission at 24 hours
In the United States yesterday, according to the University of John Hopkins, a new infection of the crown virus was detected.
A total of 4,178.021 infections have been confirmed in the Western Ocean since the onset of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days until then, the virus was killed more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
The CNN report states that according to the U.S. forecasting model, the number of deaths caused by the virus will reach 175,000 on August 15 next.
Fear of the Second Wave of the Flood
The Spanish government is now trying to maintain a weak balance between the increased distribution of COVID—19 in the country.
The Spanish Health Service reported more than 920 new cases of COVID—19 both on Thursday and Friday.
No more have been identified in one day since the beginning of May, and the reports come at the same time as the Spanishs begin to lift one of the strictest bans in Europe.
The setback led to the British authorities now assigning passengers from Spain to go to the hospital at their return.
A week earlier, Spain was listed by the British as a safe State.
The situation is worse in Catalonia, northeastern Spain, where governments have taken to a greater extent the limitations to try to reconcile growth.
In the capital city of Barselóna, entertainment stations will be closed for the next two weeks, and houses will be closed at midnight.
The ban is now in force for 200 000 inhabitants in Segria County in western Catalonia.
Britain’s decision will have a negative effect on Spanish economy, which is highly dependent on the arrival of foreign tourists and is ill-played after the circuit.
Tui, the largest travel agency in Britain, canceled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
While governments around the world are said to be prepared under the second wave of the epidemic, there seems to be little interest in taking back into the vast ban on exit, which has destroyed the economy in many parts of the world.
Boris Johnson, British prime minister, has been very ill - treated and likened to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then, France’s prime minister, Jean Castex, said that the nation “will not survive, economically or socially, ” if again the ban would be imposed on the country.
If many stewards hope for the local resources that reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities, or areas, they will do well to restrain the virus in the next round if they come to it.
Five New Contagion in Iceland - Three Domestic
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday as well as two additional borders.
Thus, five subjects with positive Covid-19 infections were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
In the announcement of public protection, one infection is associated with the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football convention.
It has been sent to isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him for a fever.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavík, and according to the report, “only part of the sports team” is in sickness.
Others who were sent to the hospital are associated with man in another way.
The origin of this infection is unfounded and full-fledged by a police officer’s infectious system.
The opponents of the ReyCUP have complied with the instructions and regulations of the physician and the general public who are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
Yet, the photos of the convention are notable, as it was seen in very close association to celebrate their good way out in the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, opponents published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says: “ATH: Parents are kind to the rules that racers should pick up their own things at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday but related to the infection reported last day.
Says the report: “Islenian genetic analysis has separated the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before. ”
In this case, infection is also acquired, and it is infected in isolation and 12 in infection caused by the infection.
The third infection mentioned is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was detected on the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close association with him for a fever.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two of them were identified at the border and are asked for further studies, such as a cross border procedure.
Finally, the report states: The National Police Department and the National Doctor’s Office urge people to be careful and to take good care of individual infectious diseases.
If the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are to be found, the same person is asked to take a sample to the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the tent area booked for the sanctity of merchants - Direct visitors
The tent area of Patreksfäld is fully booked this weekend, as reported by the West.
Visitors are advised to consider other means of accommodation.
The names of the West - built Bilddal, Tálknafjörður, Melanes on Redanda, Hotel Flokalund, and Hotel Brevvivík as a second option in the position.
There is enough to be in Patreksfäld this weekend, for as in previous years, Skildborg, a festival of Icelandic documentarys in town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
From an appeal in the tent area, it can be expected that this year, if weather does not render a mark, the D.V. said earlier today from a critical forecast.
However, we can expect the worst weather southward, and hope for the Patreks.
The website bb.is first told us, saying that all other accommodations in town were already fully booked.
A whole multi-city house is growing down in the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free on Dunhaga 18-20.
In the meantime, property owners seek a replacement permit, but their business has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, tallest, and most expensive neighborhoods of Reykjavík City, there is a magnificent multi - farm house on three hills.
On the ground floor of the house, there is about 600 square meters of store space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairwells, each containing four pretty beautiful apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, but most of them exceed 100.
The house has a lot of history.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted videoleiga, the School, a dairy store Milk, Joa the gunmaker, fish sales, and now the last university printed.
The house, as it were spoken, has remembered its fig of beauty.
The house is now under much damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18, e.g., are according to a corporate register among others Magnus Magnusson and Gudrun Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went to the property group of the Pay and was the defender of the paying society.
A member of the property of the paying company is Stålskip ehf.
A steelship, e.g., is the investment company Gudru, the Holy Lady Lárus, and her children.
Guðruen is also the owner of a third part of D18.
Gudrun and her husband, August Gudmundur Sigurðsson, once drove a craft of steel.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little been maintained since then.
Tell neighbors that the situation of the house has worsened steadily since, but most recently.
On Facebook’s website, one resident says that the house “has not been very lively in the last year. ”
It may be recorded that owners have been looking for a couple of years to change the house and the land.
Other neighbors say the house has not been okay for long.
“ It’s a long time to do something decent about this spot, and it’s boring that it got so depressed. ”
Does he also say that he is indignant in the house’s owners because he has not been able to finish this, found a common surface with the neighbor of the house, and stopped this “legislative girl. ”
“Just do this in consultation with the community around so you can get on with it and finish it. ”
The "Legal Act" that is prepared to refer to is the organization process of the field that has been in progress at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga received 18 and 20 permits to build a hill on the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house, and a building on one floor, as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that project was submitted to the Committee on Environment and Resources and decommissioned it since the project was not part of a joint organisation and the localisation was not sufficient.
The city of Reykjavík then started with a trade - organisation work and finished it with an ad in the State News in July of last year.
That organization was also dear, and the Committee rejected it in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the building at the start of the building.
At that time, the house had suffered a great deal, and neighbors became weary.
When the DV asked the neighbor of the house into the situation and the response of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some understood the purpose of the house’s owner, others did not.
Others focused their anger on the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but nothing necessarily into anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was a fighter, but neighbors have a new unused area of Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicles.
One defendant in the case said he was tired of government:
“ Let’s go through the three - time process is quite amazing.
It's like Reykjavík City couldn't read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A minor answer was to the city’s phase of swiss administration and to the noble intentions of the owner and the many years of work of those who are now at the beginning.
When a journalist set up a garden in Dunhaga 18 abscessed him with an open door and a garbage bin.
Playstation computer and recent television were found in other garbage on earth — victims of Icelandic summer bells.
It was opened into the old university-print office and there a lot of cats out of the smell of smell.
Clearly, someone's been hanging around in one corner, but no one's visible.
Stables of sofas and beds and a few boards of geology pages, no doubt to be a book, resolved.
At the same time, the steps of the apartment were open and life in both.
A journalist was so lucky to bump into one of their fellow citizens.
The Romanians were having a potato dish for dinner and invited the journalist in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and imitate DV’s sources that the company has not paid for the house but heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, it is not possible to collect rent.
From the positions of mail at the door of the house, it is clear that some foreign workers have lived there during the last loss.
The management of employee rentals has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, since a step-by-step approach in tourism led to a step-by-step approach in the construction sector and these two industries were the most effective in using the services of employee rentals.
Nevertheless, in Dunhaga 18 households seemed to have enough to do, and they had enough to keep up with the work gapes, and the people in the community to dry up after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist asked the boys english, he suddenly became ironic: In the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square feet [500 m] of real estate is down.
Owners want to change the house for improvement, and neighbors want to improve the situation, but argue about the definition of "improvement".
Between the city's organizational area, at the beginning, the victim of endless appeals and the sanctity of the organisational process and the sway of the resolution of the Committee on the Environment and Resources.
In the house so dwells in the English workers, perhaps just those who go to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the July 17 issue of DV.
In an overweight campaign following a crown viral epidemic
The prime minister of Britain, Boris Johnson, will give £10 million in a campaign against overweight, which will include the prohibition of instant-bit advertising, as a result of a serious illness, in part because of his weight.
It is time for Johnson to present the campaign called Better Health tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe wheel rides for their clients in overweight and, in addition, to attack the increase in bicycle rides.
In that case, advertising on TV will be banned at 9: 00 p.m., according to British media sources.
“COVID–19 has awakened us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier food,” according to the government’s spokesman.
Johnson himself has been suffering from weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he was infected with the crown virus in spring, and it is part of his weight because he is thought to have weakened so seriously.
Women Better to Lead the Changes
She said that the new Constitution was the largest step that the nation can take toward greater power, transparency, and against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“ We need to change things a little now, and who is better at bringing changes than the community group that is easier to be in these values?
There are women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s unity.
To stand together and to be together in leading changes.
So now it's only time for us to bring these changes."
She said that she was somewhat alarming about the emphasis on Iceland as “the best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to examine what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and consider all that needs to be done.
It's a lot.
We need to know where we come from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of local groups.
We don't all have the same rules here," said Helga.
She said that women were in many ways in good business in Iceland, but she added that, as in many other places, Icelandic people lived at enormous male values.
She said that politics was about its own interests, authority, and authority, which were the forces that maintained discrimination in all communities.
“ Women have now set up this group and come together and have just become somewhat irritated by the fact that the Allies are going to take a stand against this 2012 referendum, ” she said.
“ It’s these female values that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and the fact that we're all actually sitting at the same level," she said and added that the above-mentioned values were the baseline in the new constitution.
“ We are a very rich land of natural help, and it is ridiculous that people living in poverty are here.
It's ridiculous, we can trade differently," said Helga.
“ It’s ridiculous that there is some natural law that women’s jobs are always lower than paid.
It's ridiculous that the flight attendants and nurses need to stand in an endless struggle just to achieve a humane reward."
You can sign the signing list of new constitutions here through electronic Iceland.
Trying to rob a walking roadman in the middle of town
A man was arrested in the middle of town last night after threatening pedestrians and trying to get money from him.
The police also stopped the manufacture of drugs in the town of Årby, where two were arrested for the matter.
Then the police stopped the motorbike driver at a speed of 146 km, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn around last night, and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police journal from five yesterday to five this morning.
At that time, there was a lot of noise reports about parties.
On Saturday’s night, 11 loud parties were reported and found in police journals.
Last night, however, 22 noises ran into policemen.
Six were stored in a prison cell last night.
In the Yearwives, a police force was called to-night when people shot up fireworks.
However, they had already escaped when policemen set up.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped for drunkenness and drug driving.
Four were arrested for fighting in central town last night, one of which was stored in a prison cell.
At that time, two were moved to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the middle and the other in the west.
One was transferred to an emergency department after he was injured in jumping onto trampoline in Kopavogi.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a trailer at Kjalarnesi yesterday.
According to the police journal, the wheelchair was in a “very bad condition, ” and it was still in place.
It is possible to stay at the house of Monet on the weekend of the merchants
The house in which the Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his exercise is now renting on the page Airbnb.
The next night in the house is about the store weekend.
The house is small and delicious, located in the town of Givenry, Normandie, France.
The painter of the world lived in the house from 1883 until he died in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If anyone intends to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
According to Airbnb’s website, it is almost open after a week, on Sunday of the weekend of the businessman’s weekend, and therefore some merchants may be ideal for a vacation to book the painter’s house.
The two nights over the sanctuary cost only $964 of the United States, or just over $300,000 of Icelandic dollars, as the news is near.
Thousands of people are infected and some of them start showing the symptoms of the disease caused by the crown virus
In the last three days, five individuals have been diagnosed with the crown virus domestically, and most of the infected have not been associated.
There are dozens of people who have been infected, and some of them have already shown the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three of them were detected by the domestic crown virus yesterday and two by border.
According to a specialist from a land doctor’s office, growing numbers of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading in many parts of the community.
“ There has been a distinction from the previous domestic infection, and there is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think that it has been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful right now," said Kamilla Sigrid Joseph's daughter, an expert in the field of surgeon disease.
Most of them have been infected with individuals from abroad.
More sampling takes place in the near future than some who were associated with those infected have already shown signs of the crown virus.
“Now it’s not in flu and it reminds us of other respiratory infections, so we can be quite free by doing these tests on individuals who had found reason to do something else first,” said Kamilla.
Contagion is mostly complete, but it is not excluded that more people will need to be infected.
Two of the infected were detected after attending sports events.
It has raised questions as to whether such events can be defended.
The head of the public network says so slowly as long as people follow criteria and rules.
Kamilla says that it is virtually impossible for the infected to be infected at the sports conventions.
“ If there is no more in isolation from these individuals after they have joined at these sports, we can insist that our conventions have worked.
But it is not revealed," said Kamilla.
The work of the Civil Protection Department is under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems to be foreordained,” said Kamilla.
After a week or so, there will be thousands of people in the world.
These new positions may affect compromises.
"A certain idea to cook" - See the Elisa Vidar's menu
Elizabeth Vidarsdóttir is a football player who plays with Val.
She is also a master student in nutrition, mother, and serves as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day’s activities and usually takes time to make good and nutritious food.
My usual day begins to be at work from eight o'clock," says Elisha.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at the gym about three o’clock. ”
Elisa feels very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in school.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second party.
After practice, it is good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one part to empty our mind."
Elisha does not follow a certain diet.
She is putting her hands on a master’s work in nutrition, and she knows what is suitable for her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and practice.
“ What suits me is to eat a variety of food that is well composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and fat.
However, I feel that it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to put food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It's all right, of course, to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always."

I must say that confidence is with me in the kitchen, and I believe that I am a good cook."

Medium: Get me some carbohydrates for exercise, bread with leg, cereal, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish are very often the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflicts between police and Protestants in Seattle
The city authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of rebellion following numerous protests in the city center.
Yesterday, a police force resorted to bombs and pepper sprays to try to clear a large area that Protestants conquered and spread over many blocks of houses in the vicinity of the town’s House of Congress.
On Twitter, the police announced that at least eleven Protestants had been arrested and that a study was conducted in a corrupt operation at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly using some kind of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that Protestants stoned the police with rocks, bottles, bombs, and other promiscuity and were one policeman moved to a hospital where his injuries were done.
However, the opposition in Seattle was peaceful for a long time.
The wind was for protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there has been repeated conflict between Protestants and the armed forces of the federal police.
There, like other cities in the United States, people gather under the black Lives Matter, remember George Floyds, who was killed by a policeman in Minneapolis on May 25, protests against systematic racism in American society and demands compensation.
Not revoked until after vote
It is not yet clear whether the terminations of their flight-fleet Icelandir, which will take effect next month, will be revoked.
An electronic vote on Iceland's airline agreement for a flight break with Icelandir ends at noon tomorrow.
God - given Liney Jonn's daughter, the president of the Society, is confident that Icelandir will not make a decision on the termination until the conclusion of the vote is reached.
“ This is a good thing to do, ” says God’s Law to Liney.
“ There have been no cancellations, this must be put in place so that the machines can be manned.
So, of course, after getting to know if they'll be working after the month, people are uncomfortable."
A contract signed a week ago, scheduled for 19 July.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously agreed by the Air Frances.
On July 17th, Iceland’s Air France’s government and confidant agreed to announce all-armed stop work for Icelandir, social partners approved it in a vote.
She never came to her house, but this was decided after the decision of the Icelandians to stop talking to the Air France Society, cancel out all her flightees, and look for agreements with another union.
In that case, the crew pilots were to take on the work of insurgents on board temporarily.
Asking how she thinks that the vote will take place, God’s Witnesses say that Liney is hard to tell.
“ People are in pain after this incident of Icelandir, when all the flightees of the Society were terminated and reported that the agreement would be made with another union.
It is now apparent whether it affects it," she says.
At the end of April, at the end of the year, 940 flight attendants worked for Icelandian, 900 of whom, about 95%, were cancelled.
Their period of resignation is different, for those who have the shortest years of employment, it is three months and ends at the July-August monthly convention.
In this group, about 90% of aircraft have Icelandair.
What will the agreement not be approved?
“ Then we would like to continue to discuss with our members.
With this agreement, we are meeting the demands of Ice Spirits.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants feel that they have gone too far."
The vote on the distribution agreement ends and the Icelandir will present an annual report tomorrow.
The vote on a new nuclear agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
The second quarter of the year's year's reporting will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results suggest that the income of the community decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic vote on the agreement between Iceland’s Air Safety Society and the Enterprise Association for Iceandas started on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27th, at noon.
Those who may vote for the contract are workers of Icelanda who pay social expenses to the Air France Society.
The Ice Spirits and the FFI signed a new core agreement on Sunday’s Sunday, July 19, but on Friday before, the Icelandas had broken off discussions with the Society after the Air Frances collapsed the previous agreement in a vote at the beginning of July.
At that time, Icelandim had told all the flight attendants and the Society’s pilots on Friday, but they were withdrawn after the signing of a new nuclear agreement.
According to a new nuclear agreement, a pilot must fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The agreement is valid until 2025, where pilots’ regulations and pilots have been integrated for how long a single watch can be flown.
At a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, the agreement was presented to the FFI’s social partners and described many flight attendants as newsrooms discussing them over dissatisfaction with the agreement.
However, most seemed to agree that the agreement had to be approved in order to keep the FFI alive.
The second quarter of the year will be scheduled for the EBIT community, its management of the financial and tax base, with a negative rate of about 100 million to 110 million dollars, or about $15 billion in Icelandic dollars.
The Ice Spirits sent interim calculations to the House of Buyers on the last Wednesday, where they said that the income of the Society was about $60 million on a quarter or $8.3 billion.
Handsome money and its equivalent were about 154 million dollars at the end of the quarter, about $21 billion.
Icelandir also aims to provide the Society’s financial resources in August.
Icelandir is planning to conclude contracts with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month prior to the end of a partial ferry service.
New variants rather than a new type of virus
“ New viruses only mean that this has been an individual from abroad.
This is not something that has been grinding in the country," says Már Kristánsson, head of the County Hospital infectious disease department, of the report that “a new type of virus” has been detected in the country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was discovered to have participated in the social work of a sports club at Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection is unfounded and infection is ongoing.
A person who came to the country on July 15, and who was associated with him, was also diagnosed with a person who began to show signs of COVID—19.
Yesterday’s infection associated with the infection reported on the last day, and after sequencing in Icelandic genetics, “a new type of virus that has not been detected here before was detected. ”
Contagion is complete in relation to that infection.
It is noted that the virus is not a new virus, but it is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new SARS-CoV-2 crown virus.
It is better to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asking what it means, and whether it might say anything about the start of another wave of epidemic, Már says that, as is the case in a single case, there may be no more of it.
“ However, in the event of domestic cases that do not have links from abroad with the same genotype as this particular variant, it would be possible to conclude [in the second wave], but it is premature to say so, ” explains Már.
Goodness in the hot pot
Is the secret to the happiness of Iceland hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC’s programmers lead to the likeness of a fun video that sheds light on the country’s venerable and hotspot culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique worldwide, and it is claimed that there are no equal number of bathing areas in the world.
The natural heat of the earth is its foundation, but also the tradition of swimming here.
While children’s health was legal in 1940, older citizens are still able to use hot water to improve their health.
Health is described as a solid part of the country’s general welfare.
The pot is all equal, regardless of class and position.
Freed by mobile phones, people talk on personal notes about home and space or enjoy the imaged power of the water: meditation and loading the batteries of the soul and body.
Is to pick up a hundred days in the election
Hundreds of days are until the United States elects president to four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he's got a prank to pick up.
Joe Biden, the prospective Democrat Party candidate, has a high priority in the Trump National Survey.
According to a recent survey by the news agency, the number of Americans believes that the nation is on the wrong track.
Similarly, Trump’s reaction to the pandemic of the new crown virus is very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans than ever thought that the President had been mistreated by economics.
More specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he has kept a good track of economics.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
On average, FiveThirtyEight is followed by Biden 49.9 percent at national level, but by Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift his attention from his performance toward the passenger to Biden, promote so - called cultural issues, and offer policies that are to be governed by law and order.
However, Biden’s offer is very keen to keep an eye on Trump, and it is highly likely to win if the election is really about how Trump has been working in the past four years.
The unpopular Trump also seems to be going down to the Republican Congress and fear that the Democrats could even reach the majority of the U.S. Senate, which has so far been very high.
Politico reported that during the days, keeping up with groups and candidates was comparable, and that is now the Republican Party would have its greatest impact for decades.
The EEA has been particularly poor in the 2016 Congress, and now it looks like that development will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the inhabitants of the suburbs to follow them, including by saying that he will be President Biden, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and promote racial disagreements.
Among other things, Trump has dropped regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was designed to increase the diversity of the suburbs.
Then he urged “homewives ” of the U.S. suburbs to read an article by former Deputy New York, claiming that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburbs and agreeed with Trump.
“ The bite will ruin your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!" said the President.
The population of the U.S. suburbs is an ever - growing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all candidates in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The polls have shown that despite the fact that Trump secured a small majority of the suburbs in 2016, its follow-up has been significantly reduced.
Although there are differences between the samples, Biden has been measured by about 15 percent for Trump in the exodus recently.

After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have suggested so far, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Fire would be famous “the light at the end of the passages, ” pointing to the expected pandemic of the crown virus that the world is now passing through together.
Africans have an additional year to prepare themselves, and Japan’s authorities make up for the costs of delay.
Yet, everyone keeps his head at an end.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would become the scene of the Olympic Games this year, Japanese representatives’ joy was genuine.
They cried and laughed in exchange, for Tokyo had applied to keep the games in 2016 but bowed down to Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan would bathe in the world’s attention.
The games were to be held on July 24 to August 9, but they have been delayed for a year, starting instead on July 23, 2021, and ending on August 8.
If you don't keep the games then, if the crown virus is still too threatened, the games will be stopped.
Yet, no one wants to think that way to the end.
Olympics are no ordinary sports contest.
Nothing can be saved, the show should always be wonderful and try to top the last game.
The choice of the city for Olympicism is based on the evaluation of the election committee on the cities' presentations.
The grander the presentation — the more likely it is to be.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars trying to keep the Olympics in 2016 or over $2 billion.
The second time, when the games were applied for in 2020, 75 million dollars, about $10 billion, were introduced to the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo was given the games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent $30 billion on the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean, according to the cost of building the Olympic village, the stadium, and the general area of the country’s interior to manage such conventions, prepare them, and keep the games itself.
Japan’s organizers have said that the Tokyo Olympic Games, which should have been going on these days but have been delayed for about one year for the crown virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from a Japanese public accountant, published at the end of last year, stated that the cost was nearly double the cost.
It is likely that the cost of delaying the game cannot be fully evaluated, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run from $15 to $30 billion.
There are so large numbers that, according to the lowest possible cost, all taxes of the Icelandic State were only worth about half of the Olympics.
Olympics are an event of magnitude that has often become the subject of a discussion by economicists, who try to look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the most important sense, many seem to have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are less than positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
A short - term effect, for example, is a very large number of jobs for a short time, but for a long time cities tend to sit up with a debt stake and a huge cost of small - scale human activity.
Rio, Brazil, has been in trouble with a lot of debt for the games in 2016 and has been in trouble with costing maintenance for all the major sportsmen's interests built for the games.
After the London 2012 games, only 10 percent of those who received jobs related to the Olympic Games were unemployed before.
This means that only a small part of the work was new.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in maintaining the Olympics because of the sloping costs of human activation built up for the games.
However, the benefits are often thought to include increased traffic for tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, but there is a great deal of uncertainty about the games 2021.
Also, it is not possible to accept any number of audiences who usually attend the games.
The main issue, however, is the honor that cities have to bear, but it is difficult to appreciate for money.
In spite of the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy the players bring is not that they can be valued.
Of course, although the show is often magnificent and there is nowhere to be saved, it is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes in the foreground.
For some proselytes, it is just a surprise to delay the game.
For example, in his article on the Olympics, Chloe Esposito, an Australian femoral woman and a gold winner, is a cassoon and has been far away from a good joke this summer, but hopes to be in a competitive form for the 2021 plays.
So it is among the athletes who are only rather happy with the temptation, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to quit the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, in some cases delaying the games means that they quit the contest before the games take place.
Trust his body simply not to go through years in addition to strict practice.
Few athletes found themselves in the hearts of audiences at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio and Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold round her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been attending several interviews in his country of America recently to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to play in 2021, but she's not necessarily sure she'll still be on top of the games next year, because she'll be 24 years old.
Although not generally considered old, it is higher for a high - age woman.
“ This is a sensitive subject, ” says Biles, but smiles on another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee, asking if she plans to reach the same length in the 2021 games as she did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’ll still be on top after a year of practice, ” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body is not able to cope with the stress of a lot of exercise.
Nevertheless, she is zealously practicing for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was a uncomfortable feeling to suddenly stop practicing when the pandemic was at its highest and the gym was shut down.
There was no exception for Biles as long as all sportsmen were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympian gold could not buy any access beyond the others; she needed to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form certainly is a little better than that of most people.
“ We have a rigid plan now.
It was difficult to start rehearsing after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we're running out of time, and I'll keep up with the exercises as the year goes by.
Of course, we do not know exactly what these games will be like, or whether they will be held, but we still practice on the basis that they will be, can’t do anything else.
I've been working too hard to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With it, as with others, there may be doubt, or perhaps more consciously, that the situation may arise that the games will not be held in 2021 at all.
However, predicting this is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation during the pandemic of the crown virus will be in July 2021, and nothing else can do but prepare for the Olympic Games, on the basis of the year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid walks.
Disturbance of marriage due to an epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry the ex-Bacheloret Competitor Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about now," said the actress in a conversation with People.
“ We would like to get married sometime and have our dream wedding and all those who are dear to us.
But we decided to slow it down and focus on what is important now, and it is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I look more at world affairs than weddings these days.
There are many things going on and we're supposed to focus our attention on what's happening in the world."
