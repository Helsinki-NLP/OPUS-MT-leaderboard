Welsh MEPs do not want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, currently known under the Assembly Members (AM), are not fully satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is due to the plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A representative of the Labour Party Labour explained his group was concerned because “it rhymes on Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means ‘duste’ and pwp means ‘bæsj’.
A representative of the Wales Party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was ‘unsatisfied’ and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said his group was ‘open’ for the change of names, but noted that the statement of MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British slang word for ‘dust’.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the change of name, said: ‘Of course, it is the members themselves who have the last right of choice as to the name to be mentioned’.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation which showed general support to rename the Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parlaiment Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
The representatives suggest other alternatives, but getting all the parties to reach an agreement can lead to a headbreak for Parliamentary President Elin Jones, who is planned to deliver a draft legislation for the change of name within the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
The representatives have the last right to vote on what to call them when they debate the law.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote for the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decade long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement on their territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
People's vote supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change in names is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Styles – the cracks of Harlem wear
'The old ones I spoke to have told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,' said Adams.
‘Now none of the parts are present.’
He said that the bar's rejection was understandable.
"People socially associate with each other in other ways" today, he says.
‘Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, all of which visit regularly.’;»
As far as the churches are concerned, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe. “And sooner or later they are back at the beginning.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuary.
‘The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches have to close the doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.’
Both cracks were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist unit moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had stayed nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a brothel of dealers on 125th Street – one of Harlem's main colleagues – because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 did great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioner made plans for the reconstruction they bought in a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that carillonet was "the church bells of the poor people".
The expert who played carillonet in July called it something else: 'a cultural tax' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillonet in the world that was played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the biggest carillonet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complex interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of which are led by the church's doctoral leadership and others by the bishopry.
The Church Council – the leadership of the church, composed of laymen – wrote to the bishops in July about its concern that the bishops’ office would ‘try to impose the costs’ on the church council, despite the fact that the church council had not been involved in the initiation of the architects or contractors sent by the bishops’.
Some parish children complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the bishopry.
Hai damages thirteen-year-old lobster diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared after lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends in about half an hour's Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to drag the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel he first thought that the boy shouted out of enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but he realized afterwards that the boy shouted 'I was bitter!'
I was bitter!'"
His whole collarbone was torn up," said Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
'I cried out that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'', added Hammel.
The guy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is left in critical condition.
The type of shark that did the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious injuries in the upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to do its part in the UK beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenge Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with departmental-like makeup and beauty-care shelves, manned by specially trained staff.
The extended shelves are tested out in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong penetration into the United Kingdom’s 2.8 million beauty market, which is constantly experiencing growth while the sales figures for clothing and home items fall.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s attempt to find a new use of the space previously used for TVs, microwaves and home items.
Sainsbury's has said that they should double the number of beauty products they offer to 3000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product range from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better space in marked brand areas, in the same way as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunchs its Boutique make-up brand with mainly vegan products, because there is growing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's shops. One opened in Croydon in South London last week, while the other opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online commerce and a new tendency to buy small quantities of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, has said that the sales are eventually going to look more and more like a warehouse, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the Aldi and Lidl cheap shops with more services and goods except food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The last attempt by the Supermarket to upgrade beauty care and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation was closed after a dispute about the distribution of pharmacy income in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's selling his 281 store caches to Celesio, the owner of the pharmacy chain Lloyds Pharmacy, GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skin labels, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said, "We have transformed the look and design of beauty-care shelves to create a more inviting environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who are so prepared to give advice and help.
Our selection is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us a beauty competition that represents a new experience of action.’
Peter Jones is “fast” after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones is supposed to be furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million agreement with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories mark, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to the Gwyneth Paltrows brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is programme manager in This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand for the last second to focus on his own new gold-bordered contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "fast" at an exciting meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. This was where the golden girl of television admitted that her new contracts – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time to pass over to their clothing and accessories, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she is going to leave Truly, Jones left Great Britain on the way to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: ‘Truly was doubtless Holly’s first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security in the next decades.
Everyone is completely shocked that she has chosen to withdraw.
There was no one who could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now a warehouse is full of goods at the headquarters of Marlow, which is now ready for sale.’
Experts believe that this Morning program leader, who is among the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, may cost the company several million pounds because of large investment in products such as cushions and lights,mote and coscler, as well as a potential delay in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the last ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman of the board in March.
The two couples go on holiday together and Jones holds a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin hosting the I'm A Celebrity I'm A.
A source near Jones said yesterday, "We won't comment on his business affairs."
Chickens 'and then we fell in love with'
He knew about the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment some would consider ‘small presidenty’ and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
said Trump in his imitation of a news anchor.
‘I have not given away anything at all.’
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, having declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a great mess on the road to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a ‘equivalent response’ from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States, instead, still has sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a congregation of his constituents.
"We do very well with North Korea," he said.
‘We were going to war against North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his work to improve the relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as putting a stop to rockets, helping to get released hostages and to get the remains of American officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act with presidentship, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this staunch arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump and pointed in the area right in front of him.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia rage an island and kills hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, non-resident non-profit institutions were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 % of Lombox residents had lost their homes, no national disaster was declared a requirement for international assistance to be provided.
‘Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it quite clear that they do not ask for international help, so it is quite challenging,’ explained Sumbung.
The children are now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but are not yet sure if foreign workers will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Crisis Management Institute, said that Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations should be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Given the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is terribly poorly prepared to deal with nature's anger.
Ly to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of an alert handler on Palu, although an alert had been issued, has probably contributed to the death figures.
Even under the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquakes is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's failed infrastructure to a major point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and rail.
But the lack of money has been a big problem for Joko's administration, which is going to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from sustained sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have gone over to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more tens of thousands had to escape their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with macheter, arrow and bow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with late compensation in battle against Chelsen
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting for 89 minutes in the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqi about 30 meters from the Chelsea target while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it towards the longest corner.
The test went high above the box as the ball fell towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it can be done, so I was just trying to give myself as good a time as possible,’ said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and hit the ball once and didn’t think too much of it and just kicked it on.”
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed direction near the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's court half.
Kovacic came with a quick handover on the subway.
He then fired by a great breakthrough care that led Hazeard into the box.
Hazeard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner met a left foot kick past Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the group game of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League in football for men in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Death rates from the tsunami in Indonesia reach 832
The death rates following Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami have increased to 832, announced the country's crisis management unit early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a threshold of 7.5 that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six metres, explained the establishment’s spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380 000 inhabitants, was full of materials from broken buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for killing after a woman gets stabbed to death
A killer research has started after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contacting.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: ‘We’re at the very beginning of the investigation, but I’ll ask anyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask all, in particular taxi drivers, who may have caught up on their car camera, to contact — they may have information essential to our investigation.’
A police spokesperson confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said that they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was questioned by telling a man that the whole area is now being treated as a scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 2:00 a.m., two police cars were standing behind the barrier, while a third car was standing just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the containment and had an overview of the apartment complex.
People who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by reference to log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial drawn into the dispute about 'rewriting history'
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures that were carried out by his fanatical puritan supporters.
But the history team Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crik's publisher as "tubly" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: ‘It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace also became a goal.
The British Civil War's iconoclasm was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's error will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's amazing representation of Cromwell is a proof of the 19th century's opinions and is part of historography to a man many believe still deserves to be hailed.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell will be by many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, seen as Parliament’s defender against outside pressure — in his time, of course, it was about the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact representation is still the subject of a historic debate.
What's certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has formed the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single identifiable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.’
Killing Pigs Takes the Life of Chinese peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on is the market in south-west China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only by the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered by blood from a torn pulsary near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is getting ready to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on 30 May 2005 in the town of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
Morning after the cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pigsti was open.
He said that inside the pig's path there was a big mistake with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
‘Brained to my cousin was bloody and maltracted’ explained the cousin, referred to as Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Recording from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His corpse was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police collected evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking someone else.
It is true that Yuan’s family and market management negotiate compensation for death.
Even if that happens, it's not the first time that a pig has attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple at a farm in Massachusetts, and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer's wife managed to chase away the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive in general, but that the taste of blood may have a triggering effect.
‘They just play.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
You only have to show sufficient respect.’
The rest of the hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the southwestern United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves above the colder sea on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will, however, lead to flooding on its way through North Mexico and southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 5:00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a tree begins to form across the Pacific and move east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity northward towards the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Thereafter, the interaction between tropical moisture and the straw approaching will lead to widespread heavy rain in the south-west in the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, liquid shrubs and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will result in precipitation rates of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular south areas of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a danger of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain can result in river valleys becoming wide-eyed roaring rivers, and thunder will lead to local gusts of wind that may contain dust and sand.
The tree that is approaching will result in local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along South California.
Total rain falls above 1.3 cm are possible, and this can lead to fluid rush and rapid, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the area's first rainfall of rain time.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and will last all Wednesday.
October can lead to some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes colder but the tropics keep very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout central America on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, continuous summer heating will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and east United States are likely to get a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twenty from Southern Plains to parts of the north-east United States.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday - this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate message indicates that East America is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six television networks, saw Thursday's arresting testimony from the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault to have taken place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, political festivals continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday's great surprise last second, when it came to the conclusion that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it so that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100% sure that this did not happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated the average number of viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seen numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed the consultation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems measuring office viewers.
To give some perspective, this is the viewer number that corresponds to the final game of the American football championship or Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led by the networks, with average sightings of 5.69 million for the full day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest continued to be high after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
On Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the lift to a court meeting while demonstrators screamed and shouted at him.
He stood with lowered glances for several minutes while he was peeled out, while the event was sent directly on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
‘Do you think he tells our country the truth?’
He was told that "you have the power when so many women are powerless".
Flake pointed out that his office had come up with an opinion, and said, as the lift doors closed, he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the Court of Justice was to vote on whether or not Kavanaugh's nomination was to be continued to the entire Senate for reconciliation.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week, as the democratic minority has encouraged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake took his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's choices had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of ‘political game’ around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, the British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to run a ‘political game’ with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine the interests of the nation.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called "Chequers" plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union should obtain each other's tariffs was "fully ridiculous".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a man who is suspected of having shot and killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and charged with intentionally killed, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims's spectacles lost during the basketball roof.
The police found the spectacles at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to have shot and killed Wayde.
His guarantee is set to USD 350 000, according to The Advocate.
The coroner in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a bullet wound in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for their mission to collect refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local population for their contributions to the investigation which led to an attack.
LSU's sports manager Joe Alleva thanks to the area's police force for his "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU’s basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is “broken” and “in shock” after Wayde’s death.
'This is what we fear at all times,' said Wade.
Volcan spray ash over Mexico City
The ash flowing out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighbourhoods of Mexico's capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevenarión de Desastres, Mexico's public crisis prevention establishment, warned the people of Mexico on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity rose in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within a day.
The ether monitored several cases of bulging and shaking.
Pictures of social media showed a thin layer of ash that covered windscreens on the cars in the neighborhood like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicians have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The vulcan, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters for independence had a conflict with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstration stations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote of the Catalonian release.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police, bombarded them with eggs and powder painting, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
The handcuff also broke out later on the day, when the police used batons to limit the fights.
For several hours, independent demonstrators cried out ‘Never forget, never forgive’, face-to-face with Unionist demonstrators calling ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor damage they received during protests, according to the local press.
The tension remains high in the release-oriented region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming abundance of secession, but it was a bad meeting because the vote was boycotted by most people who opposed the release.
According to the Catholic authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote that was taken at polling stations across the region.
Release teams hit camps in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held anyway, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist prostitute with his wife, said that he no longer had presumptuous hopes about the Catalonia's ability to be independent.
'Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy of getting a vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties who support Catholic independence have had difficulties in maintaining pressure this year, as many of their well-known leaders have raised themselves in exile or are in custody while awaiting legal proceedings for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict is aroused by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense", he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have imprisoned pending a trial since late last year, announced that he would be elected to the European Parliament next year.
‘To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best I can do to condemn the oppression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish Government,’ he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 are arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blummings said that the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An armpit may also have been fired against the car at some point.
Mengas attack leads to Livingstons 1-0 claims against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
Retired Livinston astounded Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 battles as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be decisive, and Gary Holt's side is now similar to the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won off course in the Premier League this season and is going to play against the leaders of Hearts, who are lying eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will have to play their home fight against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained unbeatable through six struggles in the division. Chief Holt has not yet lost a fight after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against his lazy guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct procedure caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send kicked on after walking in to meet Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The host allowed Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could make problems for their guests at deathball.
And that's how the decisive goal came to.
Rangers gave up a free park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaboration to give Menga clear track, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, Rangers had had the ball pretty much all the time, but home team defense had proved to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a nearly scoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of the Rangers-keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston deathball in a near-short pass.
Crossings continued into the Livingston box and were constantly saved, while two punishments — once after Halkett’s protest against the exchange of Glenn Middleton, and once by hand — were ignored.
‘Fenomental’ from Livingston analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The playing style and the crew have hardly changed since they got to the top again, but Holt should have much of the credit for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a hugely well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worralt on the toe for the whole fight.
Rangers, however, did not have my inspiration to sign with.
Although they have sometimes been very good under Gerrard, they could not meet this standard.
The last part of the fight was labs – they only got into the home team's court half once – and it was a bit of a Ranger's upsurge, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smile and blue sky on Saturday 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
There has been division over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police indicated security as the reason why a crowd of 25 000 was not allowed to gather in front of the musk, but many trailers came up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also heard from them, criticising both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the splinter that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Dectford collision: Syclist killed in a car collision
A sac has been killed in a collision like a passenger car in London.
The collision took place in the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in the Deepford southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the nurse was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on site.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a driveway where the driver escaped from the scene on Children’s Street, about one mile from Saturday’s collision.
Metropolitan Police said that the police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus services are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers have been injured in an incident in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and still going on.
Specialised 'Tornodo' officers have been picked up to handle the event, involving eight prisoners and restricted to one flute.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on site.
A prison spokesperson said: ‘Specially trained prison staff have been sent in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind the lock and beat.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmates.
And last October, the rebel police were called to deal with a serious incident in which the employees were attacked by billiards.
The Orkanene Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (may be beneficial for droughts)
It's the source Arizona is being taken by a tropical low pressure, but it's likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa's remaining force moves through the desert areas in the south-west and leads to flood hazards.
National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain weather will start late Monday night.
National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ‘ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.»
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongolia Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the south-west, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin mountain chain, are likely to get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those outside the flood risk, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this precipitation is likely to be beneficial, since the south-west US is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, little more than 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane encounters Rosa land at the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane power on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind force of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific, thus losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to meet Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday evening or afternoon.
Precipitation over parts of Mexico can be severe and lead to major flood hazards.
‘Total precipitation of 7,5-15 cm is expected from Baja California to north-west Sonora, with possibilities of up to 25 cm precipitation’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border of Arizona gruesome Tuesday morning as a tropical print, which this moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah within late Tuesday night.
‘The main danger expected of Rosa or its residues is very severe precipitation in Baja California, north-west Sonora and the south-west desert of the United States’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This precipitation is expected to produce deadly floods and liquid rushes in the desert and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murders
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of attempted killing, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teen boy was found damaged in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 p.m. BST on Sunday.
He was driven to the hospital, and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who may have a mobile recording of the incident to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has "resented under the smallness and mind" of the democratic party
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party’, said Trump in front of a public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been “slow under the smallness and mind” of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the Congress on Thursday, and denied the strong and emotional accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault against her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testifies to his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that ‘the American people saw where brilliant, capable and courageous’ Kavanaugh was that day.
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most effective lawyers of our time, with a spot-free habit in public service,’ he told a collection of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about how important it is that Republicans vote in the middle elections.
‘We are five weeks away from one of our most important choices in life.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
‘That’s why I’m travelling around fighting for the best candidates.’
Trump claimed that the objectives of the Democrats are ‘to resist and prevent’.
The Senate's first interim vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican party has said to CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunami, the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out into the sea by huge waves dubbed against the beaches when a large earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves dubbed in land around sunset, destroyed everything in their way and dragged many out into drowning death.
The tsunami came into the heels of an earthquake with strength 7.5.
‘When the tsunami father arrived yesterday, people still ran with activities on the beach, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s crisis management (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
‘The tsunami was not alone — it carried cars, wooden tribes and houses, it hit everything on land,’ said Nugroho, and added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed up in trees to escape from the tsunami and survived.’
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photography published by the crisis management site showed many damaged buildings and shops, distorted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The record of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Institute for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) stated in a statement that the power of Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times higher than that of the nuclear bomb that was released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the ethat.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘extensive’ and said that thousands of dwellings, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found caught in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the dead figures and damage can be larger country coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely crippled, completely without information” from Doggila, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300 000 people there," said the Red Cross in a press release, and added that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse.’
On Saturday, the establishment was strongly criticised for not informing us that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had taken before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared by social media you hear a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami approaches passing by on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes on the beach, tearing up buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The military has started sending transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuates still desperately need food and other essentials.
The city's airport is only open for auxiliary work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death rates after the tsunami in Indonesia are rising above 800.
It's awful.
World Vision staff from Donggala have come safely to the centre of Palu, where they have sought shelter under the tarpaulin tent in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to the Doseba Sinay.
"They told me that they saw hundreds of broken houses," he said.
It's awful.
As relief organisations began their bleak preparations for providing emergency aid, some complained that foreign auxiliary workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released in a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
‘It is still a provincial disaster,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for Indonesian Red Cross.
‘When the government says ‘Greit, this is a national disaster’, we can open the boundaries of international aid, but the situation has not yet been statused’.
As the sun descends upon Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their dear are among the miracle stories that brighten up the gloomy news of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was liberated by rescue crews after spending two days trapped under ruins with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandino, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders of the Asian Games, which were carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those who were caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
‘As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional ought to wear,’ he said.
Gendon told me that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the players who attended the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only led to grey check marks, rather than to a pair of blue check marks.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thefts steal USD 26 750 during mini-banking in Newport on the Year
Friday morning the thieves stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled a mini bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and made himself ready to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who “grun up behind the Brink’s staff” and stole a cash bag that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspected escapes from the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Everyone who has information about their identity has to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
Kanye West rapper changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The library previously known as Kanye West. ”
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a long time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his act on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancelled on an 'emotional basis' basis, according to the serial creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye -- as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.»
He's one of many famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously cooperated with West, has also varied between the use of dashes and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use military against civilians
Mexico's acceding President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody represals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he “never will use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
Military troops shot against a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968 and killed as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements struck root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and experienced by artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made notices about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its side, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
‘A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough,’ said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chance that the next major achievement in artificial intelligence comes from the United States," said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is Director of the Sinovation Valves, who has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that struck the best Othello player in the United States, and later was a manager at Microsoft Research or Director of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee acknowledged the US government's previous technology contests, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation's wise heads.
Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government appropriations, according to Lee.
‘It is not China that steals the academic leaders, it is companies,’ said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed intelligent minds from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that change in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I believe that those who have an artificial intelligence doctorate should receive an automatic residence permit," he said.
China's Government Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organisations donate funds to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Department created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. Code aimed at establishing a National Safety Commission for artificial intelligence has been halted for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a public vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’ in order to resolve a decade long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement on Greek territory, and has vetoed their inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a broaching campaign has raised doubts as to whether the attendance will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece’.
Those who support the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be eligible for membership of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
‘I came here today to vote for the country’s future, for the youth in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for us all,’ said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is likely to be crucial, because a large number of Members have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The election commission of the State said they had not received any irregularities reports by 13.00.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent at previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe”, said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors in order for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, Mr Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and pulled forward chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the vote.
‘We are positive to NATO and the European Union, but we will be reported with elevated head, not being released in the back road,’ says Kavadarkov.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries such as China and Russia and become part of European integration.’
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead badly forced investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
‘I think most people will be too, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO,’ said Zaev after voting.
He says a 'yes' response will be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43 per cent of the voting rights will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required attendance.
Another study, carried out by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of the respondents have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle the pro-west government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero manoeuvres past the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0-owner on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously light when he scored a goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a passport at the start of the sequence.
He ran about race with three Brighton defenders before he got out on the open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passport to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, which used right shoes to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
'Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems', the City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
‘We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal right then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League game.
This target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball into Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of contacts before he led Sterling towards the longest corner.
Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the deadline.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League team game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be the spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet strongly.
The always equally competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on the track on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, who runs over Los Angeles Dodgers with one battle in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card place with a 5-2 victory over Nationals Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
Even if we don't have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be what's most likely to be the highest battle level I get to play this year.
Why should I not attend to it?"
The Nationals have still not announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but should certainly be inclined to take Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bully session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-hand Washington player has won this season 18 games and lost 7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 laps.
Trump People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation around the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about how important it is that Republicans vote in the middle elections.
‘All we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant.
Trump continued: ‘You see this cruel, cruel group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back at any cost.
They don't care who they hurt, who they must overrun to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we shall not give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, aim to ‘resist and prevent’.
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "slow and bad and ugly and dishonest".
He referred to the Senate court committee and mentioned the democratic senator, Dianne Feinstein, by name, on which the audience bowed loudly.
‘Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Um, um, um, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you — it was very poor body language — the worst body language I've ever seen.’
Labour is no longer open to all.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a large number of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was to be censored because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policies, concerning national security, concerning Europe – ironically enough similar issues that de Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
On the look-up for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday it said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood at many of the meetings, and the promise of ‘softer, friendly’ policies is too long forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different opinions are not allowed in the working party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of their acceptability to the party management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought that I shared many political positions with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, agreed to the security of the nation or to the internal market of the European Union.
When I talk to the public -- and it doesn't have anything to say what I'm saying -- I receive a well-being of bad news on social media that requires me to be set aside, condemns central politics and tells me that I shouldn't be in Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know that I'm luckier than any of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that sex-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never stand out.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how rough separation has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the workers' party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to all, and every motion of censure and every change in the electoral rules is becoming the party narrower.
I have received many advice in the last two years where I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will “do everything better”.
But that's not why I was involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the neglect of thatcher government that had led to my classroom at the public school I went on literally falling, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and prime minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor did I know the previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have misunderstood my political positions or disagreements with current management.
To those who submitted the representative proposal on Friday, I just want to say that since the country is raging our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour Leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it's to the ones I represent, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of removal or political uncompromising will prevent me from doing what I think best serves your interests.
Chris Leslie is the Parliamentary Representative for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unbeseired Ayr rises to peak
Two late attempts have changed the end result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to sail in this fantastic entertaining Tentent's Premiership fight.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only ones unquoted by the ten.
Finally, there was as much of their superior defence as their ability to use the opportunities they had that led to the home team losing the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our struggles so far and are still undefiled, so I must be satisfied with that," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honors to Ayr, they were better at using the opportunities than we were."
Grant Anderson's trial in 14 minutes, with the destination park from Frazier Clemo gave Ayr management, but a yellow card to the Scotland manager Rory Hughes, lent from Warriors, looted Melrose's balanced position, and Jason Baggot performed a trial without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty park before he, just before the break, scored and the target park a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a goal park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on the stretcher, and from the start, Ayr management increased even more oath an attempt by Stafford McDowell, with the destination park from Climo.
Ayr's working captain, Blain Macpherson, then got a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of it to have an extra man on the track to the fullest with an attempt from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team however came strongly back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have handled Climo when he had not the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the inflection behind the protruding Ayr-moulen.
Climo performed a target park, as he did again almost completely from the start, after Kyle Rowe obtained David Armstrong's boxing park and sent flanks Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant business
It seems that the Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the serving industry – it was recently discovered that he was named as Director of a chain-validated restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program for which he writes and plays along with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphyll.
The duen has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to public listings, he is director of the A driftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hint that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s ‘living restaurant business’.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, a non-coastal country, hopes the right will open the way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol a rigged marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonas are decorated with the motto: ‘We are entitled to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.”
The whole inland state of Bolivia has still freshened in memory of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s, and the country longs to once again be able to sail in the Pacific.
These openings may be larger than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
‘Bolivia has a driving force, a Community spirit and peace of mind, and, of course, awaits the result with a positive attitude,’ said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large-screens in many different places in the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will give its ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim that Chile – after decades of occasional negotiations – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own discharge to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial re-election campaign next year, has also put a lot on Monday's notice.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific", he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The United Nations body, which held in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean land, and has pointed out that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
That the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the last arguments were heard indicate that the case was ‘not complex’, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's case, in the last four years, things could actually have made things worse.
‘The problem with access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,’ said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations on one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came exceptionally quickly.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new generation of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “set an end to 139 years of disagreement, in favour of both parties”.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, which is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, has used the maritime situation as a political scandal.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The feeling is an opportunity to see what we need to do to overcome the past.’
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons if they can't trust US authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with the promises they made during a meeting between the two conflicting countries' leaders in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as the U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo seems ready to initiate the fixed nuclear diplomat, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that there is a wish dream that continued sanctions and American resistance to is a declaration that will ever end the Korean War will force North Korea in their knees.
The US authorities are sceptical about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang's initial implementation of significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt whether Pyongyang really has plans to give up on an arsenal country likely to look at as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion shows in Paris reveal the last thing in huge headwear, which is heading towards a dress shop near you
If you want some big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne deducted a selection of strange, over-dimensioned headgear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motels on the moteuka in Paris.
Very unractic hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most perceptive garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a spring-like broad breast that drowned models' heads.
Other over-dimensioned accessories included jewel-picked watermelons, a wizard hat or even an pineapple, but they are not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also deducted a selection of bizarre masks – just in time to Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had resealed lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation was the memory of diving equipment, including snorkel and divers, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuit.
And if you're looking for even more big fashion accessories, then you're lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats can be on their way to a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come straight in the heels of ‘La Bomba’, the straw hat with a half-metre-wide brim that has been looked at all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultmark behind the highly unractic hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another big creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the bathing suit model that carries it.
The orange electric fiave, which is edged with electric fibers and completed with a white skin handle, was the most striking creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 at the moteuka in Paris.
Luke Armitage’s famous list said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the clothing shops next summer – when the designer has had such a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland's free schools are still exhibiting academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018, with just over a year's excellent exam results, supported by individual and joint success in sport, art, music and other social activities.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both pupils and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body that can design and implement a tailored school syllabus, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after election subject at schools.
Nelson Mandela said, 'If you speak to a man in a language he understands, when the words of his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, his heart reaches the words."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exam we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest attendance rates from open school.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received the exam character A.
The data obtained from the 74 member schools of the Council of Free Schools showed that 72 per cent of students received the grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of students studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will doubtless need in the future.
Languages that are now valued at the same level as real science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the curriculum for open-air schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons stated by employers, having difficulty occupying a job vacancy, 17 per cent could be attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in clarifying young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a competitive advantage to a multilingual person.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could talk.
This is why investment in language training is now essential for today’s children.
Learning more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered most valuable for the United Kingdom on the way to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose from in open school, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish open school aims to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should actually be considered as ‘international communication’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le fiaire.
John Edward, Head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's gonna have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to watch LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday's opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he is going to play is still not settled.
‘There will be more than one and less than 48’ said Walton on Lakers’ official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game preschool plan.
"I don't need until the season matches at this stage of my career," he replied.
Time for Trump's Western Virginia People's Meeting, YouTube Channel
President-in-Office starts a series of election meetings tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned public meetings in the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court candidate is pending, Trump aims to obtain support for the forthcoming inter-elections, since Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when the voters go to the voting rounds in November.
When is Trump's Western Virginia meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's People's Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to start at 7:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump People's Meeting in West Virginia online via direct streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the week's hearings for the Supreme Courtnominated Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual abuse.
With the main objective of all these peoples' meetings, it is to support the Republicans who face a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five public meetings over the next few weeks are aimed at ‘enhancing volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives’, according to Reuters.
‘Congression control is so essential for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while moving towards a busy campaign season’, Reuters was consulted by a campaign speaker for Trump who did not want to be named.
The public meeting of the evening, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract supporters from ‘Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh press’, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month of Trump's visit to West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Western Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who's following the polls.
‘It is a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost to the polls,’ said Simon Haeder, an expert in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the spirit of fighting to keep faith as they enter Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions Saturday afternoons foursomes could have been just that year's Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum's swinging pendulum is a completely dictated sport concept, but still something that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
‘They led with six points and now there are four, so we’re probably carrying it with us as some momentum,’ said Jordan Spieth when he left the track for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they've got some wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and manager by example.
The deep celebrations became higher as his round continued, and sank to a decisive putting to raise the match to the draw as he and Thomas lay two below after two.
His putting, who won them the game of 15, was met with a similar scream – by the kind that shows that he still doesn't believe that the American team is chanceless.
'We really just have to put all the cloths in and focus on our own match,' said Spieth.
That's all each of these players now have.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have got more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are doubtless Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe's unusual but lovely couples have four out of four and do not put a foot wrong.
"Molwood" was the only pair who ungang a bookey Saturday afternoon, and ungangik also bookey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday's largest competitors, and there are no other players the audience will also see secure a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Both of them, preferably at the same time, in each one's hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily hammered up with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourballs hero, when he was partnering with Alex Noren.
After one bowey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the spanjolen and the Swedish lay so far behind that they did not have the Nubbesjans to take back the advance.
But on Sunday, there's no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn around in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the Team USA has the spirit of fighting individual, especially in the United States, has missed.
Europe leads 10-6 at the start of the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong leap at the start of Ryder Cups on the last day, after completing Sunday's fourballs and foursomes matches with 10–6 leadership towards the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two victory towards a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, which fights to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes and won two games, but they didn't get any more of the advance.
Jim Furyk's page has to get eight points from Sunday's 12 single game to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together have been nicknamed ‘Moliwood’ after a sensational weekend – is the only pair to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After breaking down Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball co-operation they seamlessly to beat down Woods and the U.S. rookie Bryson Decambeau with even more emphatically 5/4.
Woods, who leaned through two games on Saturday, glimpsed to within, but has now lost 19 of their 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for tomorrow's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a two-and-one owner against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked as number one and three worldwide.
But Europe didn't get everything they wanted on this hot day with light breeze south-west of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-ass 2&1 owner over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4/3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team managed to collect after a four-point advance at the start of the single game, but as current holders only need Fury's side to obtain a draw to keep the trophy.
But after two days of the second best, it doesn't seem that they will be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will 'in no way' agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened mistrust of the United States, and that it will in no way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual general meeting that North Korea has implemented ‘significant welfare measures’ in the last year, for example by halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing area and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"We haven't seen a similar response from the United States," he said.
‘Without regard to the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.’
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual defeat steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a seated president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the ‘atomic disarmament of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has called for a formal closure of the Korean War that went on from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for the reduction of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
‘The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’, raising pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its objective with force, and even opposing the ‘Declaration of the End of War’, according to Ri.
‘The belief that sanctions can force us in knees is a wish dream for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further distrust.’
Ri did not mention the plans for a second match between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader underlined before the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months, and added: ‘If the other party in this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been as locked as it is.’
The tone of Ri's speech, however, was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on mainland United States with North Korea rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Onde President" Trump called Kim a "rakettmann" on a suicide operation.
After threatening to ‘completely destroy’ North Korea last year, Trump stood before the UN and praised Kim for being brave enough to take the stage of disarmament, but said that much work remains, and the sanctions must remain valid until North Korea is nuclearly destroyed.
On Wednesday Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, and said that "It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the US Minister for Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that ‘the sanctions of the Security Council must still be severely enforced and without exception until we have achieved complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament’.
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to choking the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the lines of the UN General Assembly, and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had progressed, but only hours after the charge of North Korea him for having come with “gang-like demands”.
North Korea committed itself in a meeting with Moon this month to lay down a missile area as well as a nuclear weapon system if the United States did ‘equivalent measures’.
He said Kim had said that these ‘equivalent measures’ he wanted, were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students to get more sleep by dealing with the growing unculture of pudding through the night with decaf drinks as fuel.
One academic found out that students at the world's best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a talk about the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
‘After the talk, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why has nobody said this before?’
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains how important it is for students to be able to perform academically and sportingly, and for general conditions.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for university health care, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw that the students suffered from severe sleep shortages.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
‘We are aware that this will not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There's still some pride in being able to puke all night, he said, and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students led to sleep shortages being an increasing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be the students’ “secret weapons” against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleep loss puts the brain in hunger mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, taking one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
Next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar program before they roll into university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set on an alarm for when they should lie down as well as when they should stand up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga's target sets out Gernard's men
Rangers probably suffered a loss when Dolly Mengas targets hit Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 on Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted to get its first victory since February says 4-1 on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gernard's second losses on 18 battles that manager and left since his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
There were seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers were never able to cancel.
Rangers now fall into the sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to the third and is behind the Hibernian on the goal difference.
There may be more trouble in the yeasts of Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from the away.
Gerrard made eight preys on the team, which swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup finals.
Holt, however, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from the Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased how his well-trained team struck the opponents.
Rangers might have the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when Mengas's first passport sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player played the chance.
A long free park by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target.
Rangers took control, but it looked like their game was leaning more in hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos believed he would have had a penalty park after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers only managed two shots on target in the first place, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tamt kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis's opening in 34 minutes may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent during the break, and the player exchange gave immediate results when the wing player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of fight they like, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched management last time, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before the Lithgow headet from the corner.
Rangers exchange Glenn Middleton probably had a late demand for a penalty park as he got into conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the «Sunday Morning» almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist John Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the geiger counter.
The Geigerteller has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of popular culture through the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' movie, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What on earth is it?”
Rogers: ‘It is a geigerator. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headsets, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.’
Evans: "Shall you say it's making sound now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he gave name to lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancers and then injected into the patient again
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who got the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovaries she suffered from disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2, which is typically too many cancers, and then these cells are injected into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: “The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘drives the growth of various cancers’, including breast cancer, ovary, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with a fierce defense of Trump after the SNL performance.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was arched in studio at Saturday Night Live after a falsifying act in which he praised the American president Donald Trump and said he would make a choice in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he longed out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then the person says, ‘How do you like Trump, he's a racist?’
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual abuse brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded into social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back room about the choice of scalps.
‘They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they said that I don't understand what the reality is," he said, according to Washington exams.
West continued: 'Do you want to see that I understand what the reality is?' he said, and said he would 'take on my Supermann cap, because then nobody can say what to do.
Try love.’
His comments were curved at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL looked flaued out, Variety reported, where a staff member said, ‘The whole studio was dead.’
West was brought in as the last small replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he presented the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier Water Bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: TAKE AGAINST THE MASSES.”
But talkhowvert Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "who he is and it's absolutely amazing".
‘But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) which I believe is growing and asking out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are also," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was "vegetated formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow now in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg, a rapper colleague, had the name Snoop Lion, and then of course, it's the deceased musical legend Prince, who changed the name into a symbol and then the artist who was once known as Prince.
The sight of killing attempts after stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted killing after a man was stabbed at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The sights are expected to be presented to the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The visibility will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington runs out towards "gouty masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of the sword swinger Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out criticizing the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles on film often make young men think they must be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married the Game of Thrones-collain Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he was very busy with the theme.
‘It worries me quite a lot at the time — where did the masculinity go wrong?’ he said.
‘How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?’
Kit believes that TV may have parts of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strong masculinity roles.
He went on to say, ‘What are your inborns and what are yours?
What's communicated on the TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel like they have to grow just this side by being a man?
I think that's one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
During the interview he also admits that he will not do any forerunner or successor of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is ‘completed with battlefields and horses’.
From November, Kit will play the lead role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recordings, so in that way something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in which Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 % in the number of HIV- and AIDS-related population.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says health representative.
Around 40000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transferred via sex, marking a change from before.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China by transmission of blood.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way is now nearing zero, said Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased year by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease infection is due to insufficient protection at sex in these circumstances.
Since 2003, China’s authorities have promised general access to HIV medicine as part of a response to the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the inclusion of leaked data on Republican senators, flaws of «hazardous lies» and «conspiracy theories»
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected on Saturday charges that members of her staff had disclosed the personal data to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The democracy of Los Angeles assured by the claims was made by ‘ultraconservative’ commentators and websites.
'Laughs, lies and more reprehensible lies', said Waters in an opinion on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the web on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate about the charges against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was tracked to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
‘This unfounded charge is completely incorrect and a regular lie,’ continued Waters.
‘The members of my staff - who have received their identities, personal data and security compromised as a result of these unfavorable and false accusations - had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unwarranted charge is completely incorrect and a regular lie’.
Waters' statement was quickly criticised on the web, among others by former press secretary at the White House, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive”, wrote Fleischer.
‘This indicates that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They must not go into defense.
They must not doubt the motives of the prosecutor.
They must act calmly and graspably’.
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the inter-elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
"Large - if true", he tweeted.
In her opinion, Waters said that her office had notified ‘relevant authorities and the police of these false accusations’.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed", she continued "and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff".
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – low blood count Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit pick-ups in all new films with a British sloppy look and it seems to be relevant for this resuscitation of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satire about how obviously hopeless we are becoming the nation's new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and the rubber face has been renewed its license to root it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comical figure intended for territories with the non-English-speaking cinema Republic.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a dead man Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes one single note in the musical feature of the fire wagon theme during the opening ceremony at the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the role of Atkinson played in the long-lost TV ads of Barclaycard; the travelling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's one and another great moment in the latest Johnny English trip.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades sneered his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to its right, but humor feels quite low in blood and strangely redundant, especially now that the “serious” brandies that 007 and Mission Impossible willingly away have feature of comedy.
The mood seems to be more targeted at children than adults, and to me Johnny English's fades are not as inventive and spied as the silent movies in Mr. Bean.
The current precedent is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web-network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the peril of the watchman agent – a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop of a prime minister, a pompous and depressed figure that's already undergoing a complete crisis of political unopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this kind of Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform that since every active spy has been revealed, she has to pick up some of the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobic establishment, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, tormented helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, splintered with a submarine commander, a hysterical superclass lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin style of messing up everything on behalf of the Queen is back, where they confront with Olga Kurylenko amazing five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is being seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the lukewarm Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey with far-fetched side cracks: disguised as waiters, they put the guy at a striking French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to become familiar in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but yet so loveful and noisy it is so much like kids' TV with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies that they prepare plans to let the British work four days' week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day working week – but be paid for five.
The party is likely to use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an additional day of week free.
This means that employees will receive a three - day weekend weekend while they receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits into the economic agenda of the party and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to the four-day week so that employees can also benefit from the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: ‘A political review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to allow the commute to swing to the advantage of the workers — in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy’.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised a four-day week during the campaign before the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, this idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said, ‘A four-day week is not the party’s policy and is not something that is being assessed by the party’.
The fiscal spokesman for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power from ‘unintentional directors’ and ‘professors’ of public service providers.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies are at risk of not recovering the entire holding because a Labour government can ‘deduct’ on the basis of perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the corporate boards and set up employee funds to transfer 10 % of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who could receive an annual dividend of £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI review of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the findings of the Agency may cause some Republican senators to change their views.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in the 60 Minutes the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open to it than the colleague from South Carolina.
'I mean, of course,' said Kennedy.
‘I said at the opening of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, ‘Did you?’
He was firm, sloppy, unambiguous’.
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been cut into stone.
‘I’ve decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it would have to be an inquisitive finding,’ he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energeticly," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘And none of those she mentioned could not confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped fight poverty?
This Saturday is New York Host for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicated world poverty.
Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will cause thousands of people to stream to the great lawn of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group hoping to combat poverty by making more people actively work against poverty.
In order to obtain free tickets for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or «actions», such as voluntary work, sending e-mail to a world leader, taking a phone or other meaningful means of raising awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it's only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of making people fight for change, or just one case of so-called ‘clickivism’ - that people feel they contribute a great deal by signing a signature campaign on the web or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million ‘actions’ from their trailers, with a variety of targets.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and notices as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that secured funding has so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main exposures are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the United Kingdom to ‘help children exploit their full potential’, and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
‘With the support of the British Government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,’ said the Ambassador for Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 events in the United Kingdom to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the usual questions on the website, “what makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen replied: 'It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the important civil rights and anti-Aparteid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who appear at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the marine environment as a 'blocked' to prevent Russian energy exports - the Minister for the Interior
Washington can ‘if necessary’ refer to the Marines in order to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, inter alia in the Middle East, the US Minister for the Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiners.
Zink claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating upon the invitation of the legal government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the Southflake of Europe," he said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
‘The United States has the possibility through the marine environment to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that the energy does not reach the market,’ he said.
Zinc spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that profiles itself as the ‘vote of energy consumers’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are far on the way.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels’, he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The opinions came after the Trump administration has been on a tour to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe.
Therefore, members of the Trump administration, including the President himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘unsuitable’ project The North European Gas Management 2, which according to Trump made Berlin the ‘capture’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is motivated only for economic reasons and is an example of unfavorable competition.
‘I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier’, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has met with opposition from Germany, which has re-affirmed its obligations in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
‘I have major problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply,’ said Dieter Kempf, head of the BDI, following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will ‘think seriously’ on her presidential candidate for 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would ‘think seriously’ whether she would be a presidential candidate after the interselections.
During a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be quiet.
"It's time women got to Washington and fix the shaken government, and it includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
‘By 6 November, I will seriously consider whether I should be a candidate for President’.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he ‘ led the country in the wrong direction’.
"I'm worried all the way to the margin of what Donald Trump is doing to democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should leave in 2020.
58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be quiet, according to a poll from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 % supported her candidate.
The poll showed higher support to former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38 % supported a possible candidacy and 48 % was against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with a possible candidatur in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palins PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being in September.
He was arrested and charged with a home violence event on Monday night
‘What my son is going through, what he is going through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability of our soldiers with them,’ she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elf in the room” and said of the son and other war veterans: “They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for it their soldiermates and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country”.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence at a woman, clussing with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the police in Wasilla.
18 States and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
Eight states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or home violence.
Representatives of the 18 Länder and D.C. provided a briefing from the amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner ‘and his violent gang members’ abused her, but the authorities in the United States rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have profound problems with gangs and home violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the appeal court for immigrants who gave undocumented immigrants such as the flight from home violence the right to apply for asylum.
State attorney Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy ‘is excluding many decades of state, federal and international law’.
‘Feral law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle,’ said the orientation of the amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that refused immigrants access harms the US economy and says that it is very likely that they would become entrepreneurs and 'help with the necessary labour'."
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigrants to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view’ said Sessions in the policy notice of 11 June.
Asyl was never meant to reduce all problems — even all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu – the dead figures are doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It was very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforts her fever-sick son at a evacuation centre in the collapsing town of Palu.
‘The whole time you see ambulances that pick up the dead.
Clean water is defective’.
You could see residents who came to broken homes and lighten through water-damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were injured in the earthquake that had a strength of 7.5, were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside Palus' military hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors because of ongoing severe postwives.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
‘We didn’t have time to save ourselves in safety.
I was pinched by the wall that collapsed, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press, and added that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife shout for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe».
The ambassador of the United States accuses China of ‘trashing’ by ‘propaganda adverts’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that dazzled the mutual benefits of trading between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the Annex China Daily paid to move into Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in Iowa – after accused China of trying to interfere in the American Congress elections on 6 November, an accusation China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the election in the United States, marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said US officials according to Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign authorities to use advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new customs duties on each other's imports.
China's early criminal duties in the trade war were to hit export companies in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, reporting Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador in China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading post in the Sunday's Des Moines Register: "China steps up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
‘By disseminating this propaganda, the Chinese authorities exploit freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to post a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register,’ wrote Branstad.
"As a contrast – by the aviskiosk on the street here in Beijing you find not many dissenting opinions and may not experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese around China's problematic economic rate, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added: ‘One of China’s largest newspapers rejected the offer to publish’ his article, although he did not inform which newspaper it was.
Republicans are scaring away female voters before the Kavanaugh Fades intermediate, warning analysts
As many top politicians among Republicans support and defend Supreme Law candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several charges for sexual abuse directed against them, analysts warn that they will have a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the forthcoming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) proposals for an FBI review in the last second will be enough to reassure angry voters.
‘Women will not forget yesterday’s events — they will not forget it tomorrow and not November,’ said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators «November is coming!» sang the demonstrators of the Senate when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
‘Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode,’ said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
‘People say it has already been high, it is true.
But it could have been higher, especially among women's insecure voters in the suburbs and younger chooses between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote even if they dislike the President’.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which gave a detailed description of the charges for sexual abuse against the highest court candidate, analysts believed that it would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced through their appointment.
‘This has become a sad root of the Republican Party,’ said Michael Steele, former chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh is inserted – it’s also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it,’ pointed Guy Cecil, director of the United States of America, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided over who they should believe in in the accounts of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 % of the people asked were completely or quite convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35 % said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh's production.
In addition, 38 % said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied under his witness, while only 30 % said the same thing about Ford.
After the play from Flake, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate Justice Committee during the last week's oath that Kavanaugh in the drunk stand acted on her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals while at a party during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a boot to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology doctor, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees' open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where to store their data and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee speculated that the purpose is ‘world dominance’.
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up.
‘It is a historic moment’.
The app uses Solid technology to let people create their own "personal data store online" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, working lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What's unique about the online personal repository is that it's all up to the user who should have access to that kind of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide resources, processes and relevant competence to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work with the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to ‘Facebook and Google that they should introduce something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely recalcided overnight.
‘We do not ask for their permission’.
In an article on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupts’ mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even if he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
‘I’m incredibly optimistic given the next era of the network’ added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Feiring Victorian Cross Consignor from World War I
The only priest in the Church of England who was awarded a Victorian cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Colonel and priest Bernard Water was awarded the honour of 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he was awarded the highest British military mark.
A memorial was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, said it was a “flash symbol” in that the stone was to be revealed exactly 100 years after the grandfather’s award winning well.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Lygentnant Vanned his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick mist and under heavy protection from field cannons and machine guns”.
Later, he bumped towards the shot line and led the line “with great courage” forward before he stormed a field cannon self-handedly and knocked out three of the wards.
Colonel Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the grandfather's actions were "what I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James, also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the corps Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said, ‘I felt very honoured to play a role in the parade’, adding: ‘The pride of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people’.
MMA trailers were up all night to watch the martial arts program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine that you've stayed awake all night to see the packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you can't see the main game.
The participant from San Jose managed through 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were sitting up as the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after keeping awake until the early morning to see the game.
A trailer described on Twitter the transition to the child program as "a kind of sick joke".
‘It is government regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00, so they had to switch to children’s programmes,’ said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the shipment.
‘Peppi pig, yes!’.
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they're going to work with the transmission plan to include viewers in Britain in the future.
'I think we can figure it out for the rematch,' said Coker.
"But it is at six o'clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we will not be able to solve this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe with-- when we put over, there were many messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly variety.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five matches – which we usually send – and we tried to reach far from the trailers, but tipped over.
It is an unfortunate situation’.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt minor in sexuality
The Olympic tramp Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of minority towards everyone because of his sexuality -- but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't before in secondary school he realized that "he wasn't like others".
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he stood up for the homosexuals' rights to give other 'hope'.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual programme manager of the traditional programme, Kirsty Young, shall be gone for a few months due to disease.
Daley's lead was a bit lost on Lavernes' first shipment and said he felt "less worth" than everyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said, 'To this day, there are these feelings of being minor and different that have been the real motivation and have the power and strength to succeed.'
He wanted to prove that he "was something," he said, so that he did not disappoint all when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner in the Olympics and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation in this year's Social Party in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands up because he feels he is lucky that can live open without negative consequences and wants to give others 'hope'.
The three times the world champion said that he fell in love with a man--filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, which he met in 2013-- "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" -- he attended his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said the ‘whole perspective’ his had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about that I had to win a gold medal," he said.
‘You know what, there are bigger things than the gold medal in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie’.
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after having the diagnosis brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had obtained tickets for London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I kept his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in Olympic 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a home audience under the Olympics, the best feeling ever," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection -- Proud of Heather Small -- which meant much to him in the driveway before the Olympics and which still gives him goose-skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Shape weak Mickelson taken out to the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Ryder Cup-match, but he has to get in shape if it's not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball and foursome fights.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, it divides five times the major-winner the day between being a cheerleader and working with his game on the rank in the hope of correcting what is happening.
The 48-year-old never had the best swing, even at the top of his career and is not in the perfect form of the tight Le Golf National course, where the long run area still punishes wild-fearing blows.
And if the course itself is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, himself British Open-master Francesco Molinari, who has joined with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their battles this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, then Mickson's game can turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Fury expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood what role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and laid his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these layers before, and this week.
I didn't imagine he was going to play two games.
I saw for myself more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will beat Nick Falllo's record for most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached his individual record.
Micklson has 18 more, 20 losses and seven draw, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, wise, and likes to run a good time with others. He's a great guy to have in the teamroom," he explained.
‘I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives much more than just the game.
European Team Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that significant leadership at the entrance to the last day's single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
Dansken debuted in the 1997 struggle at Valderrama, where one page led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but carret to himself with a minimum margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
‘You still remind yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so,’ said Bjørn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 winning 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on that team that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I have constantly said that I am focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world”.
Bjorn is very pleased with how his players have made it on the tough golf course and add: "I couldn't do it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow there are the individual performances that are at the center, and there's something quite different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performances like golfers are tested to the full.
That's the message that you have to communicate to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he also has to go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, the opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to deliver better individually than they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great revolutions last day. He was on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed “miracle at Medinah”.
I remember every damned word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had here with his players at the entrance to the last day.
‘We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts great pressure on the middle battles.
We arrange our setup then and send out the people the way we feel.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the battle and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the game order.
'I'm betting on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way,' said Bjørn about his choices of single players.
Germany’s new warships delayed once again
German Marine's latest frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen until the earliest next year due to failure systems and galloping costs, notified local media.
The completion of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the ship of the brand new frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, who quoted a military spokesperson.
The ship should have been delivered to the Marines in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered all the way back in 2007 will replace the old frigates in the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they should be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to use the latest fresgates for up to two years away from home port.
Still delays mean, however, that the advanced warships – they were told to give Germany strength at sea – will already be out of date before they are served, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 lady created headlines last year, when the German marine officially refused to operate and returned it to the yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also discovered that the ship has a huge excess weight, which reduces performance and limits the marine capacity to carry out upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tongue "Rheinland-Palatinate" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including training of the crew – has also started to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached bleak EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany’s marine strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the Chairman of the German Government's Defence Committee, confirmed that the marine environment is actually "empty for usable ships".
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were out of order, but there was no new vessel.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the marines.
National Trust poachers on the secret life of bats
New research carried out on land property in the highlands of Scotland shall reveal how bats use the landscape for the hunting of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future conservation measures.
The study for researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as tannins and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property in order to trace bat activity during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Experts' audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and what species do what.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to produce a detailed landscape of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be part of the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the construction of pastures and the best management of the forests of bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction that affects breeding sites and habitat containment.
Windmills and lighting may also pose a risk, the same as fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials and hu tax attacks.
The bats aren't actually blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road when they fly.
ATS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten competent experts who regularly carry out surveys, surveying breeding sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland’s first and only own flag mouse reserve on Three land property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten flag mouse species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a perfect area for bats," he says.
‘We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive'.
He emphasises the importance of mapping the bats before carrying out maintenance on a property since the inadvertent destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps outsource an entire local population.
The bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, to harassment or to disturb them or to destroy their breeding places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish co-workers for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to help in the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we simply don't know how the populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers will file a case against German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as "fake news" and says that people "want fame" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her 375,000 dollars afterwards to keep close about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the accusations as ‘fake news’.
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," says five times the winner of the Gold Ball into the camera.
‘They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by stating my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to file a complaint against Der Spiegel because of the claims, which they have called ‘an unacceptable representation of suspicions in the private sphere’, according to Reuters.
Advokat Christian Schertz says that the football player will require compensation for “damage to an extent corresponding to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years”.
The alleged event shall have taken place in June 2009 at a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After attending a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have gone back to the football player's room, where he supposedly must have raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was a '99 % good man' who was failed by the 'one percent'.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later they entered a settlement outside the court because she was ‘lived for revenge’ and was also concerned about ‘be publicly out of hand’.
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to set aside the settlement because she's still traumatized after the supposed event.
Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom ‘will mourn forever’ to lose car manufacturers
United Kingdom “will mourn forever” if they lose the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was ‘anxious’ that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an appointment," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing at any Brexit without agreement could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant — producing Toyotas Auris and Avensis — produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the EU.
‘If the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, find that production at our factory stops,’ said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement as to how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that they want to close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern concerns are what manufacturers say are supply chain risks at any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of ‘order as needed’ and it arrives at 37 minutes’ intervals from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and in the EU for cars made on-demand.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may stay at the border, which the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's stock at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa Mays Brexit plan for further relations with the EU is ‘presist arranged to avoid such controls at the border’.
"We need to have an appointment. We want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only enjoy success at the moment, but that we seize this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
‘The message, not only from Toyota but also other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains’.
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that increasing costs in the long term will reduce factory competitiveness and eventually result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the trade union leader at the factory, said that the members are becoming increasingly concerned: ‘My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back’.
A government spokesperson said, ‘We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU’
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with wise Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can be “made for another week” while the fight around the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the special adviser Robert Mueller, who examines Russian interference in the elections, relations between Trump helpers and Russia, and the possible obstacle to judicial exercise by the President.
The question of Trump will reject the wise Minister of Justice or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has for many months been thriving during the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of picking up the talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that it was about to leave voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, which was then in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said 'preferably would let go' to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid that it bumped with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation of one week regarding charges against Kavanaugh, which further subjected a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
On questions about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, ‘A date for the meeting was not fixed. It could be this week, but I understood there could be a week's suspension because of everything that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will object to that statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Programvert Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to reluctance to the 'self-goodness' of television reporters, even though she added: 'I do not disagree with the fact that they are self-good'.
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
"The President is doing more questions than any previous president," she said and added without proving, "We've looked at the numbers"
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but 'if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it'll certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to make it happen often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.'
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, when he did a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit complaints
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (State Health Services) to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish MEP, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for residence and work permits for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: ‘The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit have taken place during the summer and are expected to land on a solution to the harvest.
But the British Government has also stepped up preparation for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for you all.
I will therefore repeat now how much I value the effort of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Collegiates from across the EU, and outside, provide valuable experience and competences to strengthen and improve the work of the health care service for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly their home and we sincerely hope you will stay here’.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes urgent operation after head injury
Defence player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, went through an urgent operation after having had a head injury on Saturday 31-27 losses to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ in the Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee States' main coach, Rod Reed, told journalists that the damage occurred just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the sideline and like just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a stretcher and took him behind for further investigation.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘not yet available data on the type/extent of the damage’ and Tennessee State attempt to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he finished the fight, which gives a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when purchasing a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom.
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
Documentary increases will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May today announces that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's plan to attract young people with the promise to offer more affordable housing and to set up high income groups.
Documentary increases will be imposed on persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; the extra money will strengthen government action to remedy the situation of homeless people.
The excess – which is added to the current document fee, including the higher fare introduced two years ago on the second dwelling and the purchase of a dwelling for rental – can be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to amount to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 % of newly built properties in London are purchased by persons not living in the United Kingdom, driving up prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to get foot within the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ‘occupational cities’ because of the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson made proposals to reduce the document fee in order to help more young people own their own home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded Theresa May to reject allowances on reasonable dwellings in order to resolve the UK’s ‘treasurable housing policy’.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unwarranted drafts.
He also wants to give municipalities greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, "Last year I said I would take my time as prime minister to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken-down housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and also foreign-based companies, to buy dwellings which are too hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and the unworthy situation of homeless people persists’.
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old shot rejoices over the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in the League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading the St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
‘I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and that was it," said Ross to the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
‘But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there is always something that withdraws me.
However, that opportunity would only come if I succeed in the club management’.
Ross' predecessors as the Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously refused the approximations of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
‘Success for me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League’.
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League," he said.
It's not a simple task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself to have succeeded here if I get the club back there».
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month short act in Hearts' coach's staff.
Then he helped Alloa to return from drinking to third division and helped St. Mirren from the brink of drinking to win the master's title subsequent season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a proper roadblock," he recalled when he took over the management of Alloa.
‘I really thought that the management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created a reasonable income from it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management feels quite right to me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable thing I've known throughout my adult life».
You can hear the whole interview at Sportssound on Sunday, September 30, at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time for a pint is 17.30 on Saturdays, showing the study
The summer heat wave has strengthened the income of the UK's hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Puber and bars experienced an increase in turnover of 2,7 % in July — while restaurant revenues fell by 4,8 %, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant CGA, who summarized the numbers, said: “Continued the long participation of the sun and England in the world Cup, that July followed a pattern similar to the previous month of June, when the pubs went up 2.8 %, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 % in the restaurant turnover in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the very best result, but an increase that was stronger equal-for-like than the restaurants went down.
The pubs with food served also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the rastaurant drivers.
It seemed that people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6,6 % that month, with food serving decreased by 3 %’.
Paul Newman, an analyst from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: ‘These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting and social events are still the main factors in external trade.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups still have difficulties, and a turnover drop of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of current cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-serving businesses, and the time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will result in a delayed breathing room».
Total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in roll-outs of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a business sales controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of GBP 9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children — some are only 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers show research
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed pages with ‘Fake Insta’.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20 % of the students said they have a «main account» as they show their parents.
One in five children — some are only 11 years old — create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20 % of the students said they had an innocent 'main account' as they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to ‘rape me’.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) for private schools, revealed that 40 % of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, ‘It is daunting that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them’.
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘spoken voice’ of the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated liberalist, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead sport to gain insight into her extensive experience at international level over the last ten years.
'Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide recreational environment, and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board,' said Beattie.
Doyle said, ‘I am excited to act as a voice for the liberals, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guide sport in Scotland’.
The American won 200 and 400 meters under the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four OL gold, and she's now a BBC expert, and after she had a passing ischemic attack, she couldn't walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I got a blow.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will show if I want to be restored and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am very good again and have learned to go again, and today I am doing flexibility exercises!
Thank you for all encouraging messages!’
Breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows splits public opinion on the web
A chest pump company has split opinions online with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be ‘the world’s first soundless chest pump that is worn close to the body’, Elvie published the technology-based consumer product company, a fresh and flirting music video-inspired ad to show freedom the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of high and cows to a song with among other things the following text: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see any tail' and 'In case you didn't understand it, this isn't jurisprudence, it's my pup.'
The choir continues: ‘Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls’.
However, the advertisement, published on the company’s Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has got mixed reactions from the viewers, many say the beauty templates "gravity" in the dairy industry.
‘Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," one wrote.
Eleven chest pump gets fine space in an amme-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another remarked: ‘Recoverably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?’
Another added: 'For a failed ad'.
Others defend the ad. A woman admitted that she thinks the song is "incredible fun".
‘I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I should like to have one if I still breast-feed.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another comment: ‘This is a funny ad aimed at mothers as pumps (often in the workplace or toilets) and feels like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that celebrates or judges the dairy industry’.
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is quite silent, has no cords or hoses and is well accommodated in an amme bra, so that women get the freedom to move, hold the baby and even walk out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, commented: ‘The River pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provoking launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to apply for chest pumping and all the challenges, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump is giving.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a baby mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tentleir at the Texas border in all secrecy
The number of migrant children arrested has gone into operation although monthly border crossings have remained relatively stable, partly because hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children in support players.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by coming forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other household adults had to provide fingerprints and that data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of immigration and customs authorities, testified to Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people seeking support for single minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had no prior criminal record sheet.
‘ Nearly 80 % of the people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminals immigrants.
So we keep persecuting these people," says Albence.
The officers try to handle the children more quickly and introduce new rules that suggest that some of them must meet in court within one month of being arrested, and not 60 days as was the previous standard, according to recipient workers.
Many will be presented via videoconferencing rather than meeting up personally in order to conduct their issue of residence permits for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the greater the risk of them experiencing anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns have grown in a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who wear are easily ignored because of their plant size.
They added that moving children to the tentleir without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or to say goodbye to friends, can strengthen traumas that many already wear.
Syria requests US, French and Turkish ‘occupational powers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now within its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the cover of combating terrorism and ‘will be treated thereafter’.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that ‘the war against terrorism as it were over’ in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled.
He said Damascus will continue to ‘end this sacred struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories’ for both terrorist groups and ‘all foreign presence’.
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and counselling of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in position to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘certain Western countries’ of ‘smoking irrational flight’ which makes refugees stay away.
‘We have addressed to the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns,’ he said.
They are politicising what is really a purely humanitarian situation’.
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the recent great defence position of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkeyn agreement has opposed a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province of three million people.
However, Moualem underlined that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed the hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, who ‘will be destroyed’.
The UN broadcast Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to call the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and oppositional members to draw up a post-war fundamental law for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem submitted conditions for the participation of the Syrian authorities in the Committee and said that the panel’s work should be limited to ‘review of the articles of the current Constitution’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are likely hoping for, national law and scandal end the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly become “the most dramatic conclusion of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of sighting.
Since 2014, the best time viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time, up from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC ‘The Rachel Maddow Show’ has peaked the cable viewer numbers with a total of 3.5 million viewers in evenings with great news stuff.
'This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don't understand anything,' said Neal Baer, programme manager of the ABC drama 'Designed Survivor', of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedy creator and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys Club', has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
It's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television, the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Release is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you're stretching far to be an enlightened human when you're sitting for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of 'deep in background' for the book 'Fear', Paul Manafort's leather jacket with ostriches worth $15,000 (a garment packed with hybris'), said Washington Post) and the consequences of Storm Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh..., anatomy.
At least I don't want to look at Super Mario in the same way anymore.
"Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', on the Trump show's varying role crew and daily twist on the plot (failure with NFL, shame Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, or you'll be hanging on.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27 °C and the sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he carried himself in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't tear himself loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the United States is at stake.
'I remember when we made all the crazy programs in the old days and people said that this is the end of Western civilization,' said Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right".

Money from outside flows into the regularst intermediates of Representants' houses
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district experiences a stream of money after a conversion of a congress district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly invented suburb district in Pittsburg holds with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb stands against another seated representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps with the 17th district.
The map was re-drawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were a fundamental illegal manipulation of the constituency of the Republican favor.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive campaign funding race between the largest party funding groups, the DDCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NNCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
The Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a densely followed supplementing choice for Pennsylvania’s 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given democrats little leadership.
The United States of America evaluated sanctions against El Salvador for aid to China, then drew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team for Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of ‘the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan’, said Heather Nauert, the Ministry spokesperson, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million dollars in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and death rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials exposed a top-level conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar meeting last year which was considered a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now prepared to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, said the diplomat.
And the three U.S. broadcasts calmly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next nail in the coffin can be special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the exercise of justice, which is now very robust evidence in public documents.
Mueller is supposedly also in the process of expanding the investigation into whether Trumps campaigned cooperation with Russia in our choices.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, in the middle of the preparations to meet the voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump's fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be a choice of us all on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938 German officers stood ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechs' laws at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbathing that followed.
The passage of history rotates around such tipping points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or impeded.
The Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks wise Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in bad weather ever since this newspaper announced that last year he proposed secret interceptions of the president and speculated that he was unspeakable to be President.
Rosenstein says The Times' presentation is incorrect.
‘How will we react if the recent FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible criminal charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle election for a Congress that will put Trump to account?
If we fail to pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, because of the experience I got in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the chin cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be to look optimistic at our future?'

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimisticly before meeting Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, confident that sailing over the Austrians after the impressive drawing game in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee hindered midway player Graham Dorrans from doing his first performance for the season of the draw match 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger things.
‘It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,’ said the 31-year-old.
‘We went into the game and thought we could get something and got one point with us.
Maybe we could have nodded in at the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first place, and we came out in the second round and were the best team.
On Thursday, there will be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last match, but with the home audience in my back I'm sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team's good and the kid's kissing; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, put the last season behind us and get it to."
Women lose night's sleep because of fear of pension saving
Although the survey participants had a clear form of how they wanted to be taken care of, few people talked to the family about it.
Around half of the people in the Nationwide study said they spoke to the spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
‘People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they do nothing to take that conversation,’ said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Wides Life Insurance.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care if you do not say what you want in advance.
Discussions with the adviser and family where and how to provide care.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
The long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets — if you have enough money.
Develop your legal documents: Clear out legal problems immediately.
Get a health authorisation in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that the health workers will comply with your wishes if you are to be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in an overview to prepare you.
‘It’s not just the economy that is at stake — who are the doctors?’ asked Martin.
«What medicines do you need?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Keep that list in place’.
Man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he was on his way home after an outdoor night.
The victim, a man in the 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an “unwarranted action”.
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death figures are expected to rise.
Communication is out of operation and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Doggala Regentship, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and the tsunami.
Doggala is a regent that extends over 300 km with a coastline in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative region below the province level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the sustainability beams of the central province of Sulawesis, especially the coastal region of Doggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggla have been hit by tsunami several times over the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's emergency aid administration.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit West Doggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic age of the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26th, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 hit south on Java, Indonesia's most populated island and triggered a tsunami that struck the south coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that raged dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the reign of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while people were reminded of the armies of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and led to several thousand tourists being temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested following charges.
Palin, 29 years from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, clussing with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a woman known to her when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin is imprisoned in Mat-Su custody prison and is arrested for an unsecured debt worth $500, reported KTUU.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely” when he was asked how he stood up to the guilt question, reported the network.
Palin is confronted with three class A offences, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and applied a fine of $2500,000.
He has also been accused of a class B offence, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that a charge has been made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of abuse against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being conducted in Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, clussing with the report of domestic violence and holding a weapon while drunk at the time of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he beat her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behaviour to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just like that of central Sulawesi, located north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media that show the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami danced across the beach.
Federal prosecutions rarely seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
Federal Public Prosecutors of New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York which killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been practiced in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he meeted down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution has to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘desirable’ and caused serious body damage intentionally, according to a notice of intent to apply for the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for the possible death penalty, according to the file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury dropped the 22-point case, including eight sights for killing in connection with money blackmail, on the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge for violence and vehicle wrecking.
The attack required “significant planning and intent”, said the prosecutor, who described the way Saipov did it as “holy, cruel and depraved”.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, property creations and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Claves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’ sets out the warning of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York led a case that could bring death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug salesmen, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, was a couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to perform spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no indication in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy about what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his cell phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He did not declare himself guilty after 22 points.
David Patton, one of the public-designed defenders of Saipov, said they were "uncoverably disappointed" over the decision of the prosecution.
‘We believe that the decision to apply for death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the traumas of these events for all those involved,’ said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution authorities not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should get “taste pressure” from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he should be responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom ‘would have been outcasted’ now if Farage was British secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deep-split rows has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories who participated in their own demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fights to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brüssel despite the decline – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'kaos'.
Bone told the "outcast" demonstrators in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brüssel.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand on for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit Plan'.
When he was going to explain his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not fight in two world wars to become inferior.
We want to make our own laws in our own country’.
Bone gave up allegations that the population had changed since the vote in 2016: ‘The claim that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is totally wrong’.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters, "I'm simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The Brexit Plan is unpopular with the public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who are troubling the streets and getting us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit Plan and start listening’.
In a direct message to May, she added: 'State ministers keep the job when they keep their promises'.
Farage stated that politicians would get ‘feel pressure’ if they were thinking of betraying the decision taken during the vote in 2016.
"This is now about trust between us – the people – and that politicians," he said.
‘They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they will not get away with it’.
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are on the road to betray Brexit, feel pressure.
We mobilise the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile Remainers marched through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political collection in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour Member Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app at the start of the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free limit, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland’, he added.
‘It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is serious about being a Presidential candidate.
The United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider seriously to be a presidential candidate” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the democracy from Massachusetts talked about the future during a town hall meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elects in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice President of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been at the heart of the speculations if she's going to be at Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she planned to serve as a presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it is time for women to get to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman at the top.
Arrestation after the killing of Sims from LSU by shooting
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting episode that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
‘Wayde Sims got a shot wound in his head and died as a result of it’, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene and carried weapons.
Simpson was arrested without inquisition and put in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police chamber.
Sims was a 2 meter high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starter last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per fight.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims at the world champion's title after the stable order gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stable order would play a major role during the course.
From pole Bottas got a good start and swept almost Hamilton off the track while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to run in the back of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind the Vettel, but Hamilton drove himself up after some tripping with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly let the inside be free after a double pass to defend himself in the third turn.
The Max Verstapp started from the rear row of the field and came in as number seven at the end of the first round of his 21st anniversary.
Then he led in large parts of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get a quick finish and overrun Kimi Raikkonen, who was no. 4.
He finally got around the deposit of 44 round, but couldn't increase the rate of the remaining eight rounds and the Rackkonen took the fourth place.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a wonderful job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a wonderful job to get a good blowjob,' said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
When the President spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimony to the Senate Committee of Justice. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are "bad-minded, dirty and speaking false".
"The only thing that could happen and the lovely thing that's been going on in the last few days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and mean and falter and speak false," he said.
‘When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I haven’t.
I have not done so.";
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document--'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not leaked.";
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked...no, we didn't leak," he added, with a imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September--but Feinstein refused that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reporting The Hill.
‘She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.’
But her denial was not taken graciously up by the president, who during the party event Saturday evening commented: "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to take back power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they must overrun to get power and control," said the president, Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the return fight 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got an early double target management through a shot from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of Giants.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season of Adam Keefe's men, who had come behind after they struck Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford posted the game when Beauvillier doubled management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants had management at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard settled once again with a mastery goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee the leadership for the first time during the battle late in the second round, and he secured the victory with the team's 5's half way out in the final round.
Giants, who now have lost four of the last five games, plays at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that several hundred air passengers escape earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as right after he died and ensured that an aeroplane with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many have been missed after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong afterswirls continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly swaying control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained to see that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway just then, could safely facilitate.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died in a hospital later.
Speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in California to move him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him today before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts failed when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that the dead figures can rise into several thousand, and the country's emergency response agency reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
‘The figures are expected to increase further, as many equals are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach them,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six feet high waves have broken Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “All the time, you see ambulances getting killed.
There's a lack of clean water.
Minimarkets are being robbed everywhere’.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: ‘Indonesian Red Cross works frantically to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse».
Indonesia’s President Joko Widod arrived on Sunday and told the country’s military: ‘I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?’ notified CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aeroplanes crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man has been missed after the aircraft crashed in the lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific, Micronesia, now says that one man has been missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the descending aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to the request for further details of the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transported to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the condition for all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane missed the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew very low.
'That's a very good thing,' said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade through the waisty water to the emergency exit of the descending plane.
He said that the air hosts were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair a dock, also helped in the rescue work using an inflatable boat to carry people on land before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Aviation Safety Network data suggest that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts put forward the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutions ended the procedure on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. analysts in the Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to puzzle together the movements to 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as the cell phone of Chambers in the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went in the witness box on Saturday and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis spoke true when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said that he 'loose because my trailer was in Nashville'.
Another difference was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile printing suggests that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Tellis erased, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
'He deleted her from his life,' said Hale.
The defence shall, as planned, commence its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the matter to be left to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
New York Children's Passes suing couples for cancellation after "racist" notification
A babysitter in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong message from her mother, who complained that she was ‘one and only one black person’.
The couple rejects being racist and compares the case with ‘pressing’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new baby passer, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up until the first working day of 2016.
“NEEEEELL ENJOY A PERSON”, wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the tab, there was a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman who quit Maurice, claiming that their dismissed baby passer, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands compensation in the order of 350 dollars per day for the six-month-long, losji-based scheme she was promised, but without contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, that’s how you just don’t do it”, she said to the New York Post on Friday, and added, “I know there’s discrimination”.
The couple have turned back the charges that they are racist and say the dismissal of Maurice was the only right thing, since they did not feel they could trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent her something she had not intended to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
'But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even though it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
The comparison of the case with ‘pressing’ says Plasco was due to the fact that his wife had only two months to the end and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
‘Is it such a person you want to punish?
It is not very neat", added to the stock broker.
While the legal case is under way, the national court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticise them for their behaviour and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that the readers would not accept a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was assumed, said of the letter: ‘It is difficult to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success'.
She says the father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a little clothes bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been refused. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book release was "bittery" after he left last year.
She describes Paddington as an “powerful important family member” and adds that her father in secret was very proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was no boastful person," she said.
'But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child doing a brag: you are proud of it even though it really isn't your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
On landing, the daughter had become urgent to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looked so bad, that he did not think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then I got the phone from Nad who said she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy for you, my friend.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost her effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs of the body clapped together.
I just had to sit there and wait, in sure it happened.
I couldn't cheer and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned over the loss of the daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers — who did not know about the trials she passed.
"No one knew," she says.
‘I looked down all the time and the tears flowed in a smooth stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how high he loved her."
Postcard with mourning women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and telephone numbers to call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 years old when he was hit by depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day," she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
'Everyone knew him on the smile.
They said his smile could light up any room."
He quit the job before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I worry about getting an infectious effect all the time."
Sharon added the cards 'to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit down for yourself--you have to talk to someone'.
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he felt down or depressed or anything," she said.
‘A few days before Christmas we noticed the changed mood.
On Christmas Day, he was completely in the basement – when the kids opened Christmas, they did not make eye contact or anything”.
She said his death was a great trauma to them, but they must fight through it: 'It tears up a big hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we all have to hold on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigation
‘I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for — a time- and scope-limited investigation — we could perhaps reach a certain consensus,’ said Flake on Saturday, and added that he feared that the committee ‘ fell apart’ along the fixed party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to the timing.
The options are only five weeks away, on 6 November — if the Republicans probably make it bad, it will be significantly more difficult for them to have the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators and ran lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where at the moment there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and get him into the Supreme Court.
North Korean jumpers 'faller' under Kim
The number of North Korean jumps to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korea Collection Department, said there had been 1127 jumps last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices among smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented on the public.
Most Nord-Korea defectors are subsequently offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights through China, which have the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarised zone between the two Korean states.
China considers the jumpers to be illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South — which is technically still at war — has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met with talks about the fast-locked negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work for an atomic free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
‘Without regard to the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions there will be no possibility that we will unilaterally rust down first,’ said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unable to sit in the Supreme Court
Minority leader at Representantine's house, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him impossible to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave her opinions during an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had committed sexual abuse at Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes he almost cried out and was crying out as he talked about the family and the years in high school.
He was also strongly condemning the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a “growish and coordinated character killing” organised by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton losing the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he can't sit in the Supreme Court since it shows that he's preoccupied with democrats.
"I believe he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to set Kavanaugh for national law if he was approved and if the democrats got the majority at Representants' house.
'I want to say this - if he doesn't tell Congress and the FBI the truth, he's not just unspeakable to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's sitting in now' said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Circus Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In the hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overtest certain Supreme Court decisions.
‘This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the Supreme Court and expect us to apply it,’ said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It's a fair grief, months and years when the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
‘I don’t think it’s so strange, do you?’
She continues: "I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also weeps when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and began to cry, she said to the person she spoke to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that was amazing."
Towers are allowed as an expiration for hardening partly because they become fundamentally misunderstandings.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office.
"Let them never see you cry," she said.
‘They don’t know you’re furious.
They'll think you're sorry and satisfied because they managed to catch you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was serving as Presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be unfaithful to the spouse on board a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way of examining the possibilities of quieting himself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she said with a laughter 30 years later.
‘There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since it was nearing the end of the campaign, she lay behind with the funding and swore that she would not keep quiet if she did not get in $2 million.
There was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the support players who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
‘Do they think I get a discount, or?’ she wonders.
When she gave her speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive in money and to reach voters instead of delegates, as well as anger over sexism – that she fell together in tears.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder reminded me of how the press talked about her.
‘You would think Kleenex was my lead sponsor.
I remember I thought I'd believe what they would write on my grave support?
'She cried?'
How the U.S. China Trade Wars Can Benefit Beijing
Opening Psalms in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the struggle is far from over, a break between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, says experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by putting customs duties on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs duties on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing, of course, has returned every time, now with a five to ten percent mark on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US attack for attack, and the world's second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
To get Washington to descend means to give in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliated for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give a positive account for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic bleaks in one of the countries is, in fact, much more dangerous than the spectators have realized before,' said Abigail Grace, a researcher colleague who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a thought-smie.
Syria ‘ready’ for the return of refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to return the country, which is raged after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke in the United Nations National Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism", he says.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their everyday lives and their living lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acidics have fled from the country since the war started in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people who still live in the country, who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will take good help to rebuild the destroyed country.

Europe ensures Ryder Cup owners in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with a final result of 16.5 versus 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutively on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe restored the throne when the team captain Thomas Bjørn made the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who at all during large parts of the tournament, meaned his tea-beats in the water at the par-316 holes, and had to look himself turned off by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all of his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 of the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most top-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup finale.
With eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind them, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament's most winning Europeans over the years with 25.5 career points.
"I tend not to cry, but today I cannot leave.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get back the cup.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the stickstick to his countryman John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single game on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely in the rise," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now has a registration of 13-21-3 career points in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest golfers ever, who have won 14 major titles, just turned off Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S. took the whole weekend to find the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
The team captain Jim Furyk of the United States spoke out after a disappointing performance for his troops, 'I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and I'll see in the future.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beat."
