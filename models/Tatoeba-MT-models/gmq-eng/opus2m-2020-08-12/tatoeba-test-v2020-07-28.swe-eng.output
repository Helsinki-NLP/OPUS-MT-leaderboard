TV doesn't work.
I can explain that.
She's acting like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has super powers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train speeded up quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but can you at least accept that there are people who have opinions other than you?
Tom put the book down.
I'm the best.

Tom was flashing with his headlights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like to come here.
This isn't a fish.

Does anyone here speak Russian?
I drove the car.
I have great news.
Are we safe yet?
We tried to contact the other ship.
You're gonna die soon.
This isn't good.

How big will it be?
He acted quickly and extinguished the fire.
Yes.
Is that what you mean?
I did it three years ago.
Be patient.
Get me a toothpaste tube while you're at the store.
What a smart idea!
I have another question.
You have to tell Tom.
I didn't know anything.
Here comes Tom.
If it was just that simple.
I'm terrible.
I'm going to study English this afternoon.
There's almost no milk left in the glass.
Tom can't see you.
He's got a big ego.
Life isn't permanent.
The man finally acknowledged what he had done.
Tom took off.
I almost got hit by a car.
Tom is very brave.
Shouldn't you go home?
Australia is not Austria.
Spider spins net.
I guess that can't be helped.

I'll try.
Her voice was repeated through the quiet house.
We're in Boston.
Turn the radio on, please.
She reads a book.
Do you need anything else?
Don't even talk to me.
You have to repay your debts.
It's okay with me.
I'm going to work at 7:00.
I'm happy.
What's so funny?
Did you really see Tom help Mary?
We bought something for Mary.
Can you come closer?
I have a mark.

Eye for eye.
Tom is engaged to Mary's little sister.
It's only half the truth.
When did you move to Berlin?
I really like red.

Why am I the only one they complain about? They only do one example of me and use me as a scapegoat.
What's your plan?
Don't let go of me.
Mary put some flowers in her pocket.
Is that what you wanted to say?

This is harder than I thought.
I don't speak Chinese.
She misses him.
My dog is very clean.
We've been choking about it.
You should come see us!

He spoke very loudly.
Were they good?
I'm at the north gate.
You must have mixed me up with someone else.
It's time for me to sleep.
What are we gonna do now?
No, I went out.

He's your friend.
All you have to do is ask for it.
Sooner or later, you'll regret this.

Excuse me, could you lower your voice a little?
Why did you come by?
I wish I could paint like that.
I'm sure she won't come and see you.
I don't know if he'll visit us next Sunday.

I'm glad you're here.
You have to stay.
I see him every now and then.
It's obvious, you don't have to explain it.
It's hard to accept.
