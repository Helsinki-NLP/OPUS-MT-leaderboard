Biden leads the polls in three key states
In just 100 days of election, Joe Biden, a proponent Democrat, enjoys an advance in three important swings.
CNN reports today that Biden was in Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, the Biden is measured by 51% of the follow-up to 46% of the President's follow-up.
In Arizona the situation is 49%–45% Biden in favor, and in Michigan it is heading for Biden’s superior position, which leads by 12 points, 52%–40%.
To win the election in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all these states, and indeed more.
Trump sits up these days with a crowned epidemic that the people of the country are teaching him to an increasing extent and says that the vast majority of the people in question have reacted badly, or very badly, at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has come back badly from protests and riots that caused George Floyd’s death.
If Trump and his government have acted badly or wrongly on such matters.
To crown Trump's problem, he is now under serious criticism for ordering federal police officers to violate protests in cities where mayors or governors are Democrats.
Has it created a huge wolfry among the inhabitants of the city, and this anger is passed on to other Americans?
In addition, photos of federal police taking Protestants into unmarked cars have not helped the cause of the United States.
The Lincoln Project was paying particular attention to this, but it can be seen here below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with very small votes.
In fact, Trump won very many states with little votes and won the elections with a minority votes.
Michigan, for example, defeated him with only 10,704 events.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Nearly all the polls that political commentators say are significant are the same conclusions that Biden has made.
A recent CNN survey in Arizona shows that Biden’s advance has now emerged from the scope of the survey.
The same goes for CNN and Quinnipiac University of Florida.
Even Fox News, who leaned well on the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published the same material in its media.
The last hope of the President, according to the results of the questioners, is that Trump may have the hope of reviving an important location within a swing if the attention of the election campaign is to the economy.
After the Covid-19 epidemic, the economics of the United States were severely hit, but candidates do not seem to be linking the economic impact to the crowning epidemic.
That is, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for having been in a bad position to respond to the crown virus epidemic, but they trust him more to deal with the economic crisis that will happen at this time.
However, Trump has failed to direct the discussion in the campaign.
After the riots that have burned almost continuously since the news was received from the video in a dire way, where four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion of the law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order, he became his illegitimate word.
It seems that it has failed completely, as previously said.
As the opinion polls lean more at Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to divorce Trump and declare support for either Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without mentioning him specifically.
They do so because of the arrangement in the United States to vote in many elections on the same currency.
Thus, the vote can simply mark with the second class of the presidential election part of the vote, and let it alone be valid as a vote for all other candidates of the vote.
In this way, the publishers of the Republican Party in another office are tempting to separate themselves from the delay of the Trump and to achieve independent results in the election.
Youth Olympics in Dakar postponed to 2026
Youth’s Olympics were to take place in Dakar next year, which has now been postponed to 2026 because of the crown epidemic after the World Olympic Committee and Senegal agreed.
However, the delay of the first Olympic Games to take place in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
A volunteer arrested for the fire in Nantes
A volunteer in the church in Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with fires that destroyed the church.
According to the prosecutor Le Monde, the suspect fugitive from Rwanda, who served as an overseer in the church, admitted that he had lit the fire.
The man’s lawyer, in conversation with the rest of the world, says that man looks great after his actions.
Among those destroyed in the fire was an organ from the 17th century, and historically picturesque church windows.
The 39 - year - old volunteer, who has not been named, was arrested shortly after the fire on July 18, but was then released.
He was then returned to report yesterday, and he was taken into custody.
"No way out of this"
I am well received in the home of Baltasar and Kristian Samper in Copavogi.
The reason for my visit is a new show of Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened on August 1st in the Sound of Little Korea on Snowfall.
Is this the first time the father shows up.
I have been brought down to Baltasar’s workshop, where a magnificent painting comes with me.
Great and dreary pictures of the female past but also of flying creatures; eagles on one, shadows birds on the other.
It's from the workplace. It's done to the house.
“ We had a horse here with us who bit the grass, ” says Baltasar.
"The horse works much better than a lawn mower on this hill and the hills we have."
Mireya is with us Kristina and Baltasar, and she tells us how her works are carried out in connection with the works here.
“ Inlays, mixes of paperwork and jewellery.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad is doing, where I'm working with the light and so on," she says.
“ It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain works that I was working on and would have wanted to show there, but they were stuck in Tokyo because of Covid.
When my father started painting and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my party," says Mireya, but Baltasar's work has a strong rendezvous in Icelandic legends about female baskets and water.
“ When I saw that my father was doing these paintings with the ladies, I was very happy to make jewelry that is related to them, ” says Mireya, whose jewelry is working with Sigurd No Bearson’s goldsmith at Sign’s store.
"So I'll make an installation from the jewelry."
Last year, Mireya attended the performance of 72 artists of the Academy of Understanding at Snowfall, including at the Sound of Little-Kambi, and found the building fascinating.
“ This is a new space, an old barn that has just been set up, ” says Mireya, who chatted there with Baldvina Sverrisdóttir, an artist who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar set up an exhibition together.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
“ Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain and studied at the Barcelona School of Art before he was on a world journey to study art collections and study.
He visited Iceland in 1961 and was impressed by land and nation.
Here he came back shortly later, met his wife, Kristian, and has lived here continuously since 1963 for 57 years.
Baltasar is an artist, has held dozens of private shows, and shows with Christ in many parts of the world.
It is best known for its large wall images, including wall decoration in the Flat Island Church and fresco in the West Stable Church.
“ What affects what I do is the bite that Iceland has and no other place, ” says Baltasar.
“ These low suns and these shadows are stretching and stretching.
As soon as I came here, I thought, "Wow, you can work here."
Mireya is the oldest of the children of Kristjuna and Baltasar, born 1964.
“ It was one thing I knew, it was quite clear, that I wasn’t going to be a movie artist, ” she says, asking if she wanted to follow in her parents’ footsteps.
“ I went to high school to do everything I could to get out of this.
Then I realized I was on the run.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laugh.
She has, like her father, shown many things around the world.
A lot in Japan, to form.
All the children of Baltazar and Kristian have walked the way of the art.
“I call it a virus, ” says Mireya.
"There was no way out of this."
The count of Icelandir has been in a grey area when the planers were cancelled.
The Minister of Social Affairs believes that Iceland has been in a gray area when the Society gave up all the flight fleets in the middle of a nuclear dispute.
Then he says that laws that oblige firemen to enter the apartment building will be taken into consideration after the fire on the city path of Brothers.
On July 17, Icelandair decided to cancel all 38 flight attendants who were working with the partner while the Air Safety Society’s core party was still on the table of state parties.
Departments were concerned about whether the Icelandians could take action and were prepared to resolve the matter before the Court of Justice.
However, for this purpose, the flight attendants and the Icelandas were never able to reach one another for 24 hours after the termination.
On the other hand, Ásmundur Einar Dandason, Minister for Social Affairs, says that in his mind, Icelandir’s decision was in a grey area and was in the right of wage.
“ It is my opinion that this is a right to defend wage earners.
When you're in a conversation, when you're in with a peacemaker, it's not an option to go this way.
It is quite clear to me that this had not been possible.
I think it's quite clear, in my mind, that men had come into a grey area where what this touches," says Ásmundur.
He will thus not say that other companies are going the same way as Icelandair.
“ You also now see a dangerous discussion that it is only natural to start jumping up this system to reduce this right, so I am totally opposed. ”
In the morning, Ásmundur was also asked about the reaction of government to the fire on the village path at the end of June, where three deaths occurred.
The minister now says that the matter is being examined at the level of the House and the Human Works Institute, to which he has directed.
“ It is in the law today that the fire cannot enter the apartment.
I have asked the House and Human Works Institute to examine in particular whether there is a reason to go into some legal changes.
I'm ready to make the changes that are necessary to reduce the likelihood that this can happen again," says Ásmundur Einar.
You can listen to the interview at Ásmund as a whole in the player below.
The United States of America said to increase the pressure on North Stream 2 - RT Business News
The United States Government has made further efforts to force European companies to abandon the gas management project Nord Stream 2, led by Russia, according to Welt am Sonntag, which is witnessing to people who are familiar with the issue.
According to the newspaper, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Finance and Energy of the United States have contacted European companies to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to 12 officials should have held at least two online meetings with representatives of the companies during the last days.
Those who witnessed the discussion said that the Americans had stressed in a “kind ” tone that the United States wanted to prevent North Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
"I think this is a very, very serious threat," said one maid to the German media.
These threats are in line with Mike Pompeo, U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs, last week, when he warned that companies participating in the project would be best to “come out now” or risk punishments according to 232 parts of the famous law Counciling America’s Adversities Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy investment Gazprom, which oversees the development of the project, five European companies participate in it.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Holland company Royal Dutch Shell as well as Winter Hall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, a representative of the last company said that attempts by the United States to undermine “a major project” were a clear intervention in the European powers.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Assembly approved a change in the law on the defences intended to expand US sanctions against companies involved in the construction of the Russian North Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the legal agents, the funds may be directed towards companies that provide or provide ships, guarantees, port facilities, or connection services for such ships, as well as those that offer a certificate for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of the efforts of the United States to share European energy by applying sanctions against North Stream 2, some of which have even called for Brussels to carry out countermeasures.
Moscow’s advisers have also severely criticized the action from Washington and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, the president of the Presidency, Dmitri Peskov, said that Russia would come up with a new plan on how the project will be completed if Washington’s officials hold new sanctions.
Preparing for further transport of public institutions abroad
The Minister for Social Affairs and Youth intends to bring more public institutions to the country in the near future.
In the fall of the Council's decision, however, the House's experts have previously declared that they are not planning to move north.
Asmundur Einar Dandason, Minister for Social Affairs and Childhood, said at Sprengisandi in the Bøllen this morning that it was important for the countryside to be transferred there to public institutions.
Thus, there is a great creation of value that also brings about diversity.
“ It’s economically important, we’re trying to build everything around the country.
Job building, financial building, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some natural use, and this type of work as a public job, they are very much in favour of such building," says Ásmundur.
“ Enhancing diversity, creating better support for this resource use and the currency creation of the nation. ”
The decision by Ásmund to transfer the fire brigade area of the National Institute of Housing and Humanities has been severely criticised by its employees and the National Association of Fire extinguishing and Health transporters.
Six men who have special knowledge of fires and work in the branch are all living in the capital area, and none of them are planning to move their homes to Saudárkrok.
“ I think it is quite clear that there are political differences in opinion about how hard this should be.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should attack radical measures to distribute the public services better," says Ásmundur.
“ We see that our neighboring nations, the Norwegians and the Danes have been doing this successfully. ”
He says that he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of the public institutions around the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public service abroad, just as I was doing with a National Institute of Housing and Men’s Works. ”
He takes examples of the transport of Food Institutes at Selfoss, Iceland's Landmarks to Akraness, and the unemployment insurance on Skagaststrand.
“ There is a workplace on Skagaststrand today that is of great importance to that society.
I think we should take further steps in this creature."
“ I’m preparing further steps in this creature.
More transport."
On the fifth decade of arrest in Seattle
The system of racism and the decision of the U.S. President to send the federal police forces into cities to break the dispute was protested many times yesterday.
In Seattle, 50 Protestants were arrested.
The Seattle police used bombs and pepper sprays in numerous protests yesterday that the police have described as a disaster.
21 policemen were injured, and at least 45 Protestants were arrested.
Two months ago, protesting against systemic racism began in the United States after a police officer killed George Floyd.
The flames were for protests to show harmony with Protestants in Portland.
There has been repeated conflict between the police and Protestants after the U.S. President sent to the U.S. police forces that have driven on unmarked cars to the U.S. government.
Thousands gathered in Portland during the weekend, using tears and rubber bullets to strike between them and Protestants.
A miracle child of 47 years old
The American reality star Kenya Moore works well by strengthening people in need of technological fertilization.
Moore, who is known for her participation in The Real Housewives of Atlanta, had a first child 47 years of age after technical fertilization and calls her daughter the miracle child.
“ Almost waited my whole life for having a baby, ” said Moore in an interview with People.
“ So I knew the anxiety that people feel, especially women, that I could possibly not have a baby. ”
Moore realized that she was running out on time when she was 40 years old.
“ I didn’t want to have a child alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after forty years, I looked up and thought my God good," said Moore, who did not know his father until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The star of reality says that her daughter is a miracle child in more than one way.
In addition, Moore was older than most of her natives, her daughter arrived in the world one and a half months before the day.
Moore went to a casket that proved difficult and took much longer than a traditional casket.
“I call her the miracle bear because it was a child that everyone said was almost no more likely to have, ” said Moore during the interview.

A doctor ran 35 km with a mask
The British doctor Tom Lawton ran over the days 35 miles [35 km] with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation was not reduced when using a face mask.
Lawton is a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital and has worked there while the pandemic has gone through.
To dispel the oxygen saturation theory and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run back and back with a mask.
Before he started, he established a collection at GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust, who provides food in Bradford and in many parts of Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of everything that keeps us safe.
That's why I've been in shock over the wrong information that's been passed between people about the facial mask reducing the oxygen saturation of people," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in tribulation, but during the pandemic, his patience had been reduced.
On Monday the last day, he ran from 35 km.
“I never took off the mask (no food or drink) and the oxygen saturation forced 98% every time I looked,” wrote Lawton on Twitter at the end of the race.
Prince Joakim still in hospital
Prince Joakim of Denmark is now at the University Hospital in Toulouse, France, and he is stable.
The prince had a brain surgery yesterday after having been diagnosed with a blood clot.
“ The situation of Prince Jehoakim is still constant.
The prince blessed professionals in time, and he feels well after events.
It is too early to tell how long he will be at the hospital at this moment," says Lene Balleby, Information Officer of the Danish Royal Palace of Denmark, in a written reply to the Danish public radio.
Only a few days have passed since the royal family celebrated the 18th birthday of Prince Joakim, the next son of Felix.
Happy birthday to the Queen's vineyard, Château de Cayx in Cahors, South France.
The family was still on vacation when Joakim was hospitalized yesterday.
Joakim, 51 years old, moved to France last year, where he was studying at the Ecolé Militaire military school, the first Dana.
Then he works as a defense specialist at the Danish embassy in Paris.
The French connection of the prince is strong, yet his father is vowed, Prince Henry, French, and his wife, Princess Mary, likewise.

A plane crash in Utah: Children and two adults died in a crash in a backyard
Six people were on board a Piper PA-32 plane that crashed in a backyard in West Jordan on Saturday, according to Allen Kentzer, U.S. Air Force (FAA) spokesperson.
Three of those on board died, including the 43 - year - old pilot Lee Wykoff, his 9 - month - old child and his 36 - year - old Milda Shibonis, according to the West Jordan Police Department.

Gottlieb warns that the unbridled spread of the crown virus in society makes it “very difficult” that schools open in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former U.S. Food and Drug Control Commissioner, warned on Sunday that if the crown virus spreads freely within these communities, it will be “very difficult” for school to open in a new year of study.
“ I believe that local authorities need to look at the distribution within society.
If the virus spreads freely in the community, it will be very difficult to open up in that state," said Gottlieb in “Face the Nation”.
As the fall is due to begin next week, the government of Trump had encouraged the school authorities to open their schools to students and to offer training at the schools five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and Minister for Education, Betsy DeVos, come a week after Trump warned that the crown epidemic would likely “worst before he recovers” and confirmed that schooling in places where the situation is worst, may have to delay school opening for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, the Center for Disease Protection issued guidance on how to make it safer to open school to students.
Among other things, it calls for schools to be removed from the population of insured persons, students and staff to use facial defenses and for students to be divided into restricted groups to reduce the number of infectious pathways.
However, the Centers for Disease Protection did not provide a benchmark for school managers on when to close schools if crown virus infections are increasing, as Gottlieb says has been “unlucky. ”
“ When this state of uncertainty and detailed guidance has not been given on how schools will be opened, I think that more parents will be careful, ” he says.
“ That is why I think it is very important to get detailed information on the accuracy of the criteria that the disease centers did not provide in their guidelines. ”
For example, Gottlieb said that when deciding whether to keep schools open or to switch to online teaching, the proportion of positive infections in society, local spread, and testing ability must be considered.
If between 5 and 10% analyses result in a positive conclusion, “the problem is to be resolved,” but more than 10% is“ the threshold when careful consideration should be given to whether to close school courses. ”
“ This is a sign that the circuit has reached its base in the community, ” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make it difficult for the parts of Florida, the centre of the crown virus epidemic in the United States to open up for schooling next month.
The number of coronary virus infections has increased in more than 30 countries and Colombian provinces, whereas the centre of gravity of the epidemic is so called in the sun belt on the southern coast of the United States.
But Gottlieb said that there was evidence that there was a slowdown in the number of cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
Yet, despite Gottlieb’s saying that there were “indistinct signs” of slowing down the epidemic in some lands in the sun belt, “the coals ” in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, India, and Illinois, are beginning to be warmed.
Many governors have laid down rules that oblige people to use masks in public spaces and halted destination re-opening to facilitate the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that states should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas, and other places that offer indoor entertainment and laying down rules on masking to overcome the epidemic, which are measures that enable states to avoid resuming the strict restrictions set at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
In addition to the use of masks by various states, various companies have been obliged to use face - to - face defenses.
The Quickbitar McDonald's is the latest company to make use of facials a duty and to add them to a group of companies like Walmart, Starbucks and others that have set their own rules on masking.
Gottlieb said that he assumed that more companies would take up a masking obligation, especially where the risk is considered high.
“ If we can really control the epidemic when the winter comes to us until we get a vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical course of this disease, we can do it with masks, that’s relatively simple, something that we can all do but that doesn’t directly change our lives and allow us to keep what’s very important to us, like keeping some companies open and getting the kids back to school,” he says.
Although Donald Trump did not say last week that he wanted to use a mask in the whole country, he urged the Americans last week to use facials and said at the White House press conference that “they had an impact. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: “There is news to expect”
The members of the Crystal Palace were struck for the summer when Roy Hodgson, director of the Society, declared to the parishioner Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the company.
The elephant trends have been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seem to be leaving, but he has been previously termed as a team such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, it will be shown whether a team in that quality class is still willing to pay for him high summers, especially during the financial uncertainties of the sport this summer, after a period in which Zaha scored four limits and made five supports for the Palace team that caused several disappointments.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that “the news was to be expected” about the possible departure of Zaha after confirming that the parishioner had“ made a clear statement” that he saw his future elsewhere than with his partner.
Three years are still left of the campaigner’s agreement at Palace, and last year, the Society indicated that 100 million sterling buckets would need to make him feel comfortable.
The team Hodgson completed the period with seven consecutive losses and peers on the last day of the period, causing the team to fall into 14 seats.
Zaha found a net mash only once from mid - December to the end of the long - run period in loss of Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for a sale in the last summer when he tried to get away from his partner, but no offer was made to tempt the Palace to sell.
Zaha changed the agent in January, apparently to increase the chance of leaving the company, and in the next few weeks it will no doubt be the priority of ensuring social relations.
Zaha is the player who played most minutes in the English Selection Department for Palace during the period and was the only player of the team under 28 who played 1,100 minutes or more, showing how much reconstruction on the team might be necessary to tackle with the funds provided for the player.
The Hurricane Hanna: The crowned Texas State is facing a high risk of a “two-fold strike” disaster.
Weather reporters have predicted “happiness ” in southern Texas after Hannah’s hurricane reached twice a country and brought heavy rains and windpower to up to 40 meters per second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first-grade storm (bottom-grade, five-point scale) and has now been brought down to tropical storm, but rain could still reach 150-300 mm on Sunday and the wind could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas, rain has reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the Mexican border.
Hanna was the first Hurricane of the Atlantic period in 2020, and weather scientist Chris Birchfield advised the locals to be on guard: “This is not close to the end, and we are still in the hope of a disaster. ”
In the last few weeks, Texas has been struggling with a large increase in coronary virus infections.
The governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster report for 23 countries that will be in the way of the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complex and even more difficult as the hurricane goes through an area that has become the worst out of the COVID-19," said Greg.
The hurricane first arrived at the land at 17:00 a.m. on Saturday, about 20 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far from, in eastern Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
Emergency service in Corpus Christi set up gardens near the intersections to allow them to be used if the streets are wide open.
The U.S. President Donald Trump said that the government was watching Hannah and the Hurricane Douglas, heading for Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the shore of Corpus Christi, said that the approaching storm had increased the anxiety she experienced because of the pandemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed at home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double hit for us.
I think a lot of people have become weak.
We'll get through this.
They are all good and strong, and they stand together."
Hey, flashing sailing in Southland
Heying in South Africa has been exceptionally successful in some places, since the weather has already been favourable to farmers.
Most of them are left with the first hit, the second beat is widely started, and then some are expected to reach the third beat at the end of the summer.
The weather has been playing with southern farmers, such as other inhabitants of the region this summer, and it has not spoiled the spring on the toes of the farmers.
So, hey, you've done well.
The victory of the son of August, a cow farmer in the Birtinga Hole, in the Rúsmanshup, and a workman in hayship is content and happy.
“ Yes, it’s just been good, I think farmers must just be steep, it’s been going fine, but it’s been a very good weather for the last half of the month.
Heyin is very good at the harvest good and good for the hays well over," says Sigurd.
The victory says that it is growing, especially in cowboys, that they are groaning in flat pits or conditions, which have been very good, but it is the most important thing to do in the roll - line.
“ It’s lively, yes, indeed, it’s been very comfortable these past six months or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good and it’s so comfortable to deal with.
It remembers everything, it's less stress and it can be stored until morning at times what could be done today, so it's wonderfully comfortable.
But does victory mean that some farmers will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could believe that, those who were first.
We started June 17th, it might be that those who were first had to take three things."
The original solution for the wolves - this is how they prevent the injuries
The edgesman Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English department, is a very fast player.
His opposers have had it to seize him to make sure that he does not get past them.
This has caused his shoulder to fall off several times, but now the wolves have solved the problem.
The Sun's reporting this.
In Wolves' game against Crystal Palace, the paramedics were able to smear something on the shoulders of Traoré.
“ It’s something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says a Witness in Wolves, but what was being carried on was child oil.
“ Making him more drowsy makes it harder for defenders to grab him, and so we can prevent further injuries. ”
Traoré's axe fell off first when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then the shoulder has fallen out of team four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Prince Harry England: A friend of the duke of Sussex protests claims in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott said in a conversation with Sky News that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were in no different content from that of the gossip, the only difference is that the book was bound.
The former soldier wants an increased view of the positive things he and she have done, such as their charity.
Stott said: “I feel that what is stated there is nothing different from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now in a bound - up book. ”
“ There is a historian who tells us, but it is not certain that it has come from them. ”
“ I feel that this is just another attack on them, just like the gossipers who persecute them. ”
“ I realize that they are in the light, and people want to know what they are doing, but I wanted it to be more discussed about all the good they have done and their charity work, rather than their personal affairs. ”
“ Of course, they never get away with it, for their own sake. ”
The support of the duke and the duke of Sussex overshadowed other members of the royal family, according to a specialist in the history of the royal family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had failed to make use of Prince Harry’s starry favor and Meghan Markle for their sake.
She added that the order of power within the royal family was firmly established, but that it was not possible to direct public interest.
She also said: “The fact is that all they did in support of the queen was inclined to shadow other members of the royal family, and this was considered a problem. ”
"They are extremely popular."
“ They had less wedding than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“ But while Harry and Meghan were smaller than Vilhjällm and Katrina’s, the news was just as much, because of the great interest of the world in the couple. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often regrets his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often regrets his entries on Twitter that inflate war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States said that his unexamined re-information on Twitter entries — some of which have contained material from the white race mindset — would be the most trouble.
When the journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he saw his posts, Trump replied: “A lot, too often.
It was like that in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and said, "Oh, how happy I am that I didn't send it," right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out right away, we feel great, and then you start getting calls — “Did you really say this? ”
I say, “What’s wrong with this? ” And you’ll find things. ”
Last month, Trump caused great anger after returning his entry (divided material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida, where the elderly couple called “White Power ” or“ White Power. ”
And in 2017, Trump relived three entries that were directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, leader of the right-wing British First.
The President told Portnoy that the reconnaissances that had put him in the most trouble
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t investigate it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what it says on your helmet, which is tiny and you don’t grow it, sometimes — I’ve found that it’s almost always the re-introducing that puts you in trouble. ”
The president often shares praise for himself, voiced about his opponents and conspirators with his 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him to get through the so - called “False News ” on television programs and newspapers, which he says are untruthful.
But the president’s lies have often been under the microscope, and now Trump’s Twitter entries mean that they are misleading.
The GPS system may be insecure
Many states are working to develop a different location technology than the GPS system.
An engineer says that there may be a reason to worry about the safety of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been reintroduced.
The GPS is following us every foot.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, land polls, industry, and leisure.
Most people do not think that it is a military instrument in the possession of an American army, which opened it first for general use in the 1980 ’ s.
GPS technology uses satellite coordinates at a height of 20,000 miles above ground, so natural conditions have little impact on it.
“ But it is very easy to interfere with her.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these signs," says Sämund E. Torsteinsson, professor of engineering at the University of Iceland and expert on risk management and safety of communications.
He also makes it easy to send a bug with a wrong location, such as in warfare.
“ The GPS system is owned by the US Department of Defence.
They have assured the public that the system exists at all times.
But certainly they can turn it off if it pushed into the head of a very eccentric president to let it do so, then he could probably do it," says the Smeman.
Thus, many nations are taking into account other systems and locational technologies.
Both the Russians and the Chinese operate their own satellite systems, and the European Union is destroying the Galileo location system from the canals.
“The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may have more precision and is naturally under the control of the European Union.
Then it is not one government that controls it completely but many," says the Smeman.
But many are also looking back to the old loran technology.
It's based on radio waves and was used from the '60s until the GPS was over.
The loran signals are sent on very long waves from the bottom of the earth.
“ It is the new version of the Loran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that people are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a spare, because it is a little different law to interfere with it, it is far more difficult than to interfere with an artificial system, ” says Smundur.
However, it is most likely safe to have access to as many location systems.
An experienced senator, Vern Buchanan, died of the crown virus.
“Gary was a professional in a fingertip and a loyal servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched so many lives and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how refreshing he was, the sense of humor and the joy he had in helping others."
Buchanan’s office published a declaration earlier this month that Tibbetts had no recent contacts with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had served for Buchanan from 2011.
Florida has reported 414.511 cases since the onset of the pandemic, more than 411.200 in New York City, according to the national health authorities.
National health data show that hospital admissions have increased by 79% since July 4th, U.S.A.
The data also show that at least 50 intensive care units in Florida reached tolerance on Saturday.
“ We reported that this could have an impact, ” said DeSantis in June.
“ At the same time, police work and countermeasures could be counterproductive. ”
Flight from Hornquad to Cape Town
Turch doves, rosasts, ring doves, crossbows, glimmers, and weeps are among the birds that have been entangled to this land this summer.
On the website of Southeast Birds Birds, brief news of the fleas, where they have been seen, and sometimes their sexes can be seen every day.
There are many birds in Iceland.
To illustrate, the number of people who like the Facebook page is Icelandic bird species.
There are about 14,600 members of the group.
It shares pictures of birds, and it is evident that Iceland is rich in good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
Brynjólfsson is one of them.
As he is called, a ship’s worker is a bird’s inspection station in Southeast and Southeast Nature’s Office, watching the bird’s life in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that enrich the world in Iceland and play an important role in it, and then it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a big and big predator or a small sparrow.
On the birthday of Halfdán Björnson, the bird inspection station was established in the Archipelagos, with the aim of maintaining the air and of continuing the significant natural studies he conducted since 1940.
“ He was thirteen years old when he began to provide information about birds, ” says Brynjulf, in a conversation with the nucleus.
“ We at the bird testing station are not doing exactly what Halfdán did but are building on his data by counting and marking birds. ”
Half a man was a farmer and an international scientist, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles on plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, nearly 90 years old.
Half a dozen and his siblings in the Chicks aroused the interest of many of them in Icelandic nature.
This group includes Björn Gísli Arnarson, the “Employer” of the Bird Checkpoint.
A bear was raised in the field of Reyn in the South, and he received a rich natural voice from his neighbor, a half - dead man in the Chicks.
What, though, is the bird inspection station in Southeast Germany doing?
About March 20, each year, the bird’s inspection station sets up a special bird’s nest in Einarslande, a twilight dose inside the Havn in Hornfavde.
Standard markings are made on the birds that come in the nets.
The nets are taken down around May 10, when the laying time begins.
The Internet is up all day long, at least from about six in the morning until noon.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds that enter them are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a journalist asks the wonder.
“ Yes, we share this with us, me and Bjøss.
Since we now have to work for ourselves, this can be quite a jigsaw game, but somehow we manage to do it," says Brynjulfur.
The Internet is then restored during the period August 1 to November 10 — all the days of weather.
Between watching the nets and the periods they are not up there, Bunnel and Bear are marking the crowns, the shrubs, and various moths where they reach them.
In addition, they take on special projects.
One of these projects is being carried out in collaboration with the National Institute of Natural Sciences in Iceland, and it is about gathering birds in the forest.
“ The forest mound jumps on the birds at their winter stations and then gets a ride with them to the land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they start, and that is why these ticks are not big when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find himself another host when he needs it."
But enough for ticks.
Asked how the birds in Southeast took it this summer, the Brynwolf says that the crayfish appears to be running well — where she is over the head of the crayfish.
“ The bottom line of the crown is at Hala in the South, where everything is going well.
But it is no more to be found at Jökulsárlon, where a few years ago there was a huge lay."
He says that a few years ago, there, over a thousand chandeliers were cast there, but now they can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
“ When we look at the moths and the leopards, I feel that it has decreased over the last few years what you feel about them.
But, of course, there's always a change between years."
What can explain the great change is, according to Brynjólf, probably about the supply of food.
“ After all, it’s all about food. ”
Then, too, the works of humans can be related to the survival of birds and other animals.
But some birds seem to have a pretty good time in Southeast this summer.
“ One of the positive things I feel is that it is growing again after a great decline, ” says Brynjulfur, “but while the forest has fallen dramatically in recent years and decades. ”
From sparrows, it is news that it seems that the maríar is going to be doing well in summer, as in the past.
While the forest and duvets had decreased somewhat, the Brynjulf says that it does not appear until the fall how this summer has proved to them.
But let's get back to the culprits.
Often, they draw great attention, especially if they are very short - lived and even colourful.
These two interesting features have one of the most popular features of the summer: The Rosarstar.
“ In fact, in the summer of the tangles, ” says Brynjulfur, “it has been relatively calm, but it is now known that in the countryside there is a cry, and there are ring pigeons that have been seen and are beginning to lay here.
When Brynwolf and Björn get to the point of the culprits, they also mark them, as do other birds.
Labels are international, and they are worldwide.
There are various ways to get the markings, such as the winter stations of the birds, the places where they lay, and their routes.
“ It is even possible to see how long they are on a flight, ” notes Brynjulf.
This information is useful in many ways, for example, in the case of epidemics such as avian influenza.
“ Knowledge is always being increased. ”
If anyone in the world finds a bird marked by a bird’s surveillance station in Southeast, the information is sent to the National Institute of Natural Sciences.
“ We have been restored from Cape Town, South Africa.
There was a crayon that we had marked.
One crown from us was later found in the United States."
One bird is the Brynwolf, especially the mindset, which is the bed.
“ The vacuum is our bird, ” he says, and points out that the bird inspection station and the nature room of the southeastern land have the task of monitoring its survival — which has become quite extinguished and now he has come to the toilet list.
Although it is difficult to claim what caused the shipwreck, one theory is that the forest has made its way into the sea, which was once thrown into the sea by a fishing vessel, but that it is now being used much better and that it affects the forest.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
“ You naturally don’t make me say no, ” says Brynjulfur, who laughs, adding: “Where we’re now also chasing migratory birds, we probably have to go abroad. ”
But surely the Southeast land is special when it comes to bird life.
“ This area is like a drag into the country from Europe, and then the birds are scattered from here.
To be here is very interesting, but it is smaller to be found in laybirds than in many other parts of the country.
It is not far from the wild and to the sea, so that the area like this is suitable for the attention of birds."
What about Brynjulf's favorite bird?
He thinks of himself for a short while before he answers.
I don't think the question is a good one.
“ A bird is my bird, for I have found nine out of the ten that have seen in the land, ” he finally answers.
“ I think it’s one of the most fun to take pictures of rusty saucers.
It's always fun to find birds that haven't been seen in the past on land or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But both of them have done so.
If you would like to pay more attention to the work of Binna and Bjøssa at the Southeast of Sweden, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the Birds website.
Saudi Arabia — The Sun Coast of the Future? No Alcohol or Bikini
The tourism industry has grown a great deal around the world in recent years and now the authorities in Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
Imitate the destruction of the government, which accounts for some $60,000 billion of Icelandic dollars to create a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian's reporting this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that we Iceland should get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available, and women will not be allowed to sunk in bikinis.
How, then, should tourists be lured into this strict - faith Islamic land?
This is to be done, for example, by building a new city where white beaches, moons (obviously made by men), taxis, and robots serving people.
The Guardian says that it is Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be brought into the land’s oil waste.
The Crown Prince says that it is not a discussion that women can avoid covering their shoulders and knees in public places, but at the same time admits that it is not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot where the sun is high and cannot be trusted in a wind - cooling system.
But you can wonder, ‘ If you can’t buy alcohol, it won’t also make you less interested in future tourists. ’
Francois Bozize, previously cast by the Central African Republic’s Presidential Office, announced a presidential proposal
The former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been cast by a chair, announced on Saturday that he would invite himself to the presidential elections in December, despite the fact that the United Nations is using sanctions and that arrest orders have been issued for his alleged crimes against mankind.
He announced his presentation in front of a large group of supporters at his party assembly, Kwa na Kwa (“work, work only”), in the capital of Bangui.
In 2013, the 73 - year - old former military chief and commander was taken over by the U.S. military force in the most Muslim rebels from the north who cast the majority of the nation into a fanciful civil war and a severe and long - lasting humanism.
“The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction,” said Bozize in a speech criticised by the current President, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took over power after a coup in 2003 and took office for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against mankind and for encouraging genocide, but he has not been arrested since he returned from exile in recent years.
It is not clear how the arrest order or foreign sanctions affect his offer.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to cancel the sanctions imposed in 2014 because of alleged support for armed Christian groups of Anti-Balaka.
Touadera controls the country today with the support of extensive UN peacekeeping, accounting for more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016, and he is expected to volunteer for a different period than his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of the election will be December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups that usually claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crime has been reduced, but there are still bloody incidents that are most often caused by conflicts over resources, but the majority of this diamond - rich country is not under the authority of the government.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gareth Bale’s position at Real Madrid is “unacceptable to everyone,” says Toni Kroos.
Toni Kroos, center of Real Madrid, says the position of Gareth Bale with the Spanish team is “unsatisfyable to all. ”
Bale didn't participate in any of the last seven games of the team, and he didn't participate in the LaLiga celebrations of Los Blancos, and now this summer, it's up to the player to keep still and let his deal run out, but the partner hopes that he will disappear.
“ There’s no way to avoid the situation becoming unacceptable to everyone, ” said Kroos in the Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport.
“ He was not bought to play him as little as he is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said "yes" but then said "no" later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about it.
When he was asked whether the situation had adversely affected the atmosphere of Real, Kroos said: “Not as much as possible.
I've known him for six years and we've been doing some important things together."
The Chinese give Reykjavik 2,000 faces to support the fight against the crown virus
Chinese ambassador Jin Zhijian delivered two thousand faces for the past week to the mayor of Reykjavik.
The occasion was the visit of the mayor to the Chinese Council on July 22, last.
The news was first reported.
The mayor’s visit was to refund the visit to the Chinese ambassador in Reykjanestown, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
According to Viking news, there was a talk about promoting cooperation between the town of Reykjanes and the city of Xianyang, but the towns began to cooperate between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 facets, is based on this friendly town cooperation, but the city authorities in Xianyang wanted to give masks and thus support the fight against the crown virus epidemic.
In the news of the Weekly News, the masks will be used in the sensitive institutions and service stations of the city of Reykjane for both employees and other visitors.
In addition to the flag of Iceland and the People’s Republic of China, you can see in the accompanying picture the face mask box, which reads: “There is everyone behind, but there is no brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Counts to lower wages
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from the Icelandic champions KR, next month, and says that he is interested in peers in the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has been in Iceland since 2017 and has become a Icelandic champion with both Val and KR.
However, this 27 - year - old Witness claims to miss Denmark and to move there with her girlfriend, Stefania, the daughter of Jacob.
Danan’s agreement with the KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish partner would have to negotiate a purchase price with the KR to get it in August, before the new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until winter to get to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know that the Danish departments start again at the end of August.
That, of course, means that I had to break my contract with KR-inga, but I've told them I'm losing Denmark, and they have a full understanding of it," said Thomsen to ball.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with Coach Rúnar Kristinsson, who had shown the situation full understanding, and Thomsen said that he did not believe that the price would be a big problem.
“ I have also had a conversation with two 1st branchmates after that division was over and the team knew where they would end.
There has already been a little interest in the coming period, so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic branch stops," said Thomsen, but added that it was clear that there were not many companies in Denmark that could buy up his contract with KR.
“ It’s not quite clear right now, but it’s been interested.
I also need to find the best opportunity for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and is coming with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, and asked to look primarily at the Copenhagen Seas.
Thomsen said that KR-inginga did not have to worry that he did not give himself all in exercises and games, even though he missed Denmark.
“ KR knows what it gets from me, and it is that I do things 100 percent.
I can totally ignore the fact that I miss Denmark when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who says that he's going to lower the salary of leaving the Icelandic champions in the next-first division of Denmark.
“ I’ll probably have to lower my pay only because of the crown virus crisis that seems to have shocked the Danish partners a little more than the Icelandic ones.
But I'm also studying, and one solution might be that a partner would get me a job.
Of course, most of the partners in the 1st division have an agreement with the sponsors.
I'm learning sports control through the players' organizations and I'm finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been at the beginning of the KR in two games in the Pepsi Max Division during this season, but came to a story in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the team last year and scored seven limits.
KR is equal to the choice of points in the top of the Pepsi Max division and in the game for good, but the team meets KA at Akureyri today.
Hitting the crown virus aboard the bus when the driver lands in a hot fight around a face pit
The video shows passengers and drivers on board the Arriva bus in Liverpool.
The driver is told to a woman that it is not his job to tell passengers to use a mask.
The driver said: “It is not my job to tell everyone who steps into the wagon to use a mask. ”
Commenting on the incident, one Witness said: “A man and an older woman began to visit her, and much argument broke out. ”
“ The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was really going on, and he told one woman that she was not even using the mask correctly. ”
“ The woman then stepped off the wagon and said she was going to report the incident. ”
Arriva’s spokesperson said: “The safety of our customers and our employees is still our priority.
“ Our customers are obliged to use masks when using public transport (exceptions apply) as a matter of fact. ”
“ There are clear instructions and meanings for customers about this and all other remote policies on board buses, on community media, and on our websites. ”
In public transport since June 15, the Greeks have been in force.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been identified worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the world - wide crown virus.
Most cases of COVID-19 have been detected in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to advise people with disability more often in their role
The actress participates in a new campaign to increase the participation of people with disabilities in the recreation sector.
The campaign is ongoing at the same time as 30 years have passed since the U.S. Law on the Rights of People with Disability, which will be held on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer talks about the importance of people seeing themselves and their lives reflected in a real way on the screen.
“ Nothing can replace personal experience and real images, ” she says.
“ That’s why it’s so important to hire an appropriate actor in an appropriate role. ”
Spencer discussed the effect she had on seeing the dark skin on the screen when she was a little girl watching the feature "Good Times".
The figures shown at CBS during 1974 to 1979 were made by Norman Lear, and they served as the first grins to show two parents of both African origin.
An organization against hunger pushes Yoho aside after an incident in the House of Congress
WASHINGTON (AP) — Independent Christian organization that wants to end hunger on Saturday said that they had asked Congressman Ted Yoho to resign from the government of the organization, and that he had responded to it, after what they called the “attack” of Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Democrat of New York City, accused Yoho, Senator of the Republicans of using a low-worshiped and male-worshiped crash when he rebuked her when they met on the stairs of the House of Congress last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the phrase had been as she described it.
Bread for the World stated in a declaration that the organization had met Yoho on Friday and wanted him to say that he would “justify our commitment to stand with women and black people, domestically and worldwide, leading us to a world with increased participation in all races and increased justice. ”
On the Bread for the World website, their “consensual voice ” pressures the Congress and governments to end hunger in the country and worldwide.
“ Since Bread for the World is independent of a Christian organization whose goal is to reduce hunger and poverty with sound public policies, the organization keeps up the respect, dignity, and concern that Jesus asks us to show when dealing with people in positions of power, wherever it is in the political spectrum, ” says the Declaration.
“ Our assessment reflects recent activities and the words of Congressman Ted Yoho, reported in the media, not the moral requirements of our governments. ”
During the work of the news, Yoho’s spokesperson had not responded by e-mail with an invitation to respond.
In an amazing speech in the House of Congress last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez reported on the incident in a dramatic way and expressed her words against what she called masquerade culture, which “consents violence and violent speech against women. ”
More than her peers ’ dueness, she accepted the fact that the incident was an example of far too common behavior among men.
Yoho described the incident as a brief policy discussion and that “no one had been bothered, singled or attacked. ”
He said that he saw that he had shown “a bold approach. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in her first period as a progressive senator and has received both praise and credit for her cleanliness.
The 65 - year - old Yoho is one of the most conservative congressmans of the council, and he will sit in a holy stone at the end of his fourth election period.
Wait until 98 minutes in the room to score the first goal of the season
Jesse Lingerd had not cut or put up in the English selection department during this season, until he scored against Leicester today in 98 minutes in the final tour of the division.
Lingerd had not scored in the English Selection Department since he twice scored against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came in as a backup today for Manchester United when the team met Leicester in a final game about the Championship seat.
When over seven minutes had passed, Lingerd took the ball from Kasper Schmeichel’s target Leicester and scored the empty target.
Long-term goal for Jesse Lingerd.
Real Madrid players exempt rules of search
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England during their second game at Manchester City, in the European Championships, without having to go for two weeks of sickness.
The British government has decided that travelers from Spain will have to go for two weeks to arrest the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, such as in the case of competition teams at the highest level of sport.
This confirmed the Ministry of Sports with Sky Sports.
The Ministry says that those individuals who are exempt from the rules will be only in defined areas, at the door of the door.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and media people.
Thus, the Madridians may arrive at Manchester City on August 7, without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2 to 1 during the monotherapy after losing Santiago Bernabea on February 26.
The victories will continue in the 8th joint finals in Portugal.
Delicious rain and lying over the land on the sanctification of merchants
From reports of crowded hotels and tents judging, in the least south, it is clear that Iceland has been able to travel this summer.
If those who have laid a land under foot have also been very lucky with weather and weather management DV in one matter about the fact that the summer was just out of order, so far, at least.
But now it is late for a business weekend that has been the greatest tourist weekend of the year.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared with other weekends, for events that have caused a large number of people to fail to be held in the usual year.
There is enough to mention a festival as an example.
The weather will then, of course, play a major role, but now there is a look for rain in all the country, but especially south and south-west.
The weather department predicts rains from Thursday night and at least until Saturday night.
It should be noted that long - term predictions are not sacred truth here in the northern Atlantic Ocean and can of course make changes.
According to the weather scientist Einar Sveinbjörnsson, a forecast of his weather tissue, Blinka, says that the store weekend is low.
He says: In the attic with colds that are too often reaching down to the surface, there is the fact that when warm air from the southwest tries to approach, it is only low with wind and rainfall.
Of course, there is also a warmer air that “perfects ” northward.
In support of his predictions, One wrote: “A little wave from America is moving east and with it summer - warm air.
As it approaches, it reaches “blood” in the form of reduced air pressure and a more considerate summertime. ”
The great prediction, the European account centre on the left of the map, and the American GFS predictions on the right are somewhat converse with this development.
The sign of the low will pass through late Thursday and early Friday with a sharp A-gate and rain on most of the land.
The 985 hPa set-up is then followed.
This time there is some warm air in North and Eastern Europe on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
On the other hand, it may blow up.
A man was seriously injured when a car was hit with cattle picked in Wexford
A man was seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at Ferrycarrig Bridge in Wexford.
A cattle truck ran on the bridge and ran over to an unmanned quiet car.
The 34 - year - old driver suffered a serious injury in the accident, which occurred at about 13:50 today.
He was taken to the hospital in Wexford, where he lies heavily.
The police department is investigating the scene, and the bridge has been shut down and bypassed.
A lot of cattle died in the crash.
The police encourage all traveling from 13:45 to 14:00, as well as others in the area who might have witnessed the incident, to contact the Wexford police station on the telephone 053 916 5200, the police confidant phone in 1800 666 111, or another police station.
Followed an actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
“I was shot in her like a man gets such a youth shoot, ” says Birna Hrynn Björndóttir of Marisku Hargitay, the main actress of the Games Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so overwhelmed by the actress that she came to the place of the events and waited for her for hours, just to say hi.
When Birna Hronn Björnsdóttir, owner of the travel agency Pink Iceland, looked like many Icelanders at the stress factor Law and Order: Special Victims Unit up from the centuries, she looked for the main actress of Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meetings and the actress in the show Love stories at Ras 1.
When Birna was a teenager herself, at the age that many began to develop with her intense love, she did not experience it as her peers because she stood in a tight position to suppress her own teachings.
She thought she was interested in boys’ bands and young magical heart buds from movies, but she didn’t have it at all.
“ I was cutting from poppy magazines and hanging pictures on a wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes when people come out of the closet, they go through a late rhyme.
“ We spend our teen years suppressing these teenage impulses, these shots, and so on.
I think it was one of the things that attracted me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot in her."
A few years ago, when the actress was in New York, she ran to the stage.
One of her best friends, Erlingo Ottar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie in that city and having Birnu and their friend, Gunnar Helga the son of Gudjón, to help with the shots.
“ We were working for 30 people, and we spend some time with strangers.
This is a naturally intimate atmosphere when you spend such a long time together a day so it was talked about everything and nothing."
One day, Birna is a great fan of Mariska.
One woman in the shooting team says his friend knows about the actress because he was a part of the show.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friends like to work with her actress and whether Birna can see her.
“ She tells me to stop it, she doesn’t know if she can make it happen,” says Birna.
When the film is finally finished, Birna tries to convince the woman of trying to get the meeting around for the last time.
“ She had had some glasses and said she would just do it. ”
A few days later, the wife sends a message to ask if something is happening.
The woman does not respond, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she wakes up with a long message.
“ I look at the phone and scream over me.
Gunnar Saint wakes up at the screams, and I say, "I have to take a shower, and I have to make myself nice and go down into town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actor, and cameraman Law and Order were at a hotel in Times Square.
“I don’t know when they start or when they quit, but this is the name of the hotel, you’re doing well, ” says the messages, and Birna wears her ass, asking where she takes her ride and takes the lift up to 45th where the group is assembled.
Birna settles and waits until a woman in the team comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if she can help.
“I say I’m looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived. ”
When the friend finally comes, he looks at the beara and asks how in the disaster she got all the way to the seat, but he was supposed to be a strict security guard.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and asked to see Marisku.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
Sit down here," said the friend and Birna tossing.
Along with her, there's an extra player in the factors, and they start talking.
“ I say to him, I am a fan, but you? ” says Birna.
"I played it as if it were the most natural thing in the world."
It's time, Birna's waiting.
The players regularly appear when a break is made, they get to talk, and Birna looks around and looks for Marisk, which is nowhere visible.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her he's sorry to leave.
Birna asks him to get into the hands of another employee, but she did not think that she would go anywhere immediately.
Surprisingly, the friend accepts it and reaches another employee.
“ He comes with his other friend, saying: “This is the woman from Iceland who would love to meet Mariska. ”
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend comes running to Birnu.
“ He says: ‘ Hurry!
These are unusual situations today, there are reporters with her, so she won't stop.
She's going straight to the car with them, so you have to take the chance and go down and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
"So I look right and lose my face" Birna's veins start and take the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds some 40 wheelchairs, some marked and some not.
Marisco’s trailer, however, does not feel, and then despair begins to come to an end.
“ I feel that it’s over me because I had spent half a day in it, but think well, I tried.
That was fun."
Badauf is holding Birna back to the hotel, where she looks through the window taking a look at herself with pity, and she realizes that Berna was unable to do her job.
Birna accepts fate, and it starts to rain.
“ I go under cover to cover myself with the rain.
Then I look right and I lose my face."
No one but Mariska Hargitay was there in the pants that she wore, and Birna knew well — but Birna was hardly able to move out of her mood.
“ I look at my body and my hands and think now you have to move.
Now you must go toward her."
Birna does, and she dares to peck her back in the actress’s shoulder.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I'll just say hello, "Berna's gonna break up.
“ I claim to be from Iceland and a great fan.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you."
The conversation did not go far further because Mariska's car is here and it's whistled on her.
Mariska turns to Birnu, saying: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Barna says she's a confidant, looks at the car driving away, and then breaks up.
“ I’m calling at Erling and Gunna, and they thought this was a failure.
But I was weeping with excitement and joy.
I say, "Yes, I see her." You have to see me now.
Then we had a toast to soda and tequila," says Birna.
She does not regret anything, although she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It’s like this once in your life, sacrificing such time and energy to act like this.
But I will always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birnu Hronn Beard's daughter in the show Love stories at Ras 1.
Police won't spread the virus.
There is no reason to worry that the crown virus can be transmitted with alcohol samples used by the police.
This is what a police officer in the police traffic department in the capital area is talking to mbl.is.
There have been indications from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police make use of them, when they travel on the road, and when they leave everyone who is going to blow.
The police, however, say full hygiene.
“ It’s not really a special mouthpiece, but we have a recommendation on a cup in which people blow in, ” says a police officer.
“ Some people want to do this, but we instruct people to keep a little distance, to a few dozen centimetres. ”
Asking if it feels far enough, says a police officer.
If a positive sample is found, the police use a different scale.
It has a mouthpiece, which comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
Abdominal distension: among other things, anise can be initiated to reduce pain
The relationship with depression is not a coincidence.
People suffering from bowel inflammation, a disease characterised by abdominal pain, convulsions, tiredness, flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of symptoms as a result of the United States’ anxiety and depression (ADAA).
“ This is because the colon is partly controlled by the nervous system that responds to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If your bloating does not decrease, you may have food intolerance.
The judge tries to stop the decision that children will be released from the immigration authority.
In his order on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee invalidated the future deadline by saying that the immigration and customs authorities in the United States do not have to release children if they cannot do so by any of the three routes described in its previous decree.
Gee also stressed, however, in his directive, that immigration and customs authorities should still be required to release the children without undue delay.
The three routes provided by Gee are to allow families in possession of immigration and customs authorities to be released, to put children in the hands of the responsible person, or to allow families to be released to a federal court order.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the Agency's Proyecto Dilley, who provides families with legal services, condemned the decision and told her to put it into the hands of immigrants and customs authorities to decide whether to continue having children.
“The main thing I feel is that children are kept out of time and they don’t let go unless the immigration and customs authorities agree or families agree to get apart,” said Fluharty.
Families are held in three locations of the Finnish immigration and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and the Texas Karnes County.
The children in these places are aged 1 to 17 according to lawyers and representatives who provide legal assistance.
Gee, who oversees the implementation of the Flores agreement on the care of children in custody, said in June that since “the rules on masking and social leave were not or were not closely followed,” it was urgent to move children from these positions.
969 people in custody of immigrants and customs authorities have been diagnosed with the crown virus and are in isolation or surveillance from 23 July onwards, according to immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 are confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in detention centers for families.
A total of more than 3700 cases have been confirmed in prison
Will review the laws on independence of governments
The prime minister does not say that pension funds set criteria in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
Comments from the Governor of the Bank to ensure the independence of directors of pension funds, possibly by law, will be taken into consideration.
After Icelandair went into an interview with Iceland’s Air France Society and quit all aircraft fleets, the VR government declared that directors appointed by VR to be a member of the Liveyrisfond Barriers’ Association or paid for the vote against the participation of the Life-Eye Fund in the expected share of the Icelanda.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, director of VR, later said that governments would be replaced if they did not make the recommendations.
Ragnar Thor withdrew his statement three days later as well as VR’s government.
Ásgeir Jonsson, the banker’s banker, said in the Friday news of RUV, that it was necessary to ensure the independence of directors of pension funds in the approved funds and possibly through legal change.
Katrin Jacob’s daughter, prime minister, says that the directors of pension funds are independent, but they already believe that they are guaranteed by law.
“ Now, the Governor of the Bank, who, of course, carries out the financial control, who has to do this, has said that the rule of independence needs to be examined in particular, we will of course take it to heart if something needs to be gone over there, ” she says.
Katrin says that according to laws, pension funds should set their moral standards in their investment policy.
It is desirable to consider the social and moral criteria that they want to emphasize in their investments.
“ I didn’t think anything unusual was the same way that pension funds also set criteria in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
However, I think it is natural that such decisions are made through policy-making, but not through individual investment decisions," says Katrin.
"Insisting traffic congestion at Alfusárbruu," says the president of the town government of Årborg
The weekend of S. Haraldsson, president of the town government of Årborg, says traffic congestion, which forms at the Elfusárbru on Selfossi daily completely unacceptable.
He hopes that an offer for a new bridge over the river Alfus will take place in the fall.
Now that Iceland is travelling through its country, and a great deal of traffic is on its highways, daily traffic is created at the River Alfus when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the community.
Long rows form at the bridge and can take the patience of drivers to wait in a row.
“ Yes, it’s completely unacceptable, it’s one traffic jam here and not just on Fridays, because it’s just in active days too.
There are long waiting, sometimes quite up to Hellish for those who want to get by here on their way east to shore and those who are coming to the west, so that it gives us an eye that we need to get a new bridge and soon after yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, Chairman of the town council in Årborg.
According to Helgi, the town authority in Årborg recently met with the director of theage and the designer of theage, and that meeting was very positive.
“ If you’ve ever been optimistic that you’re working on these issues, I think I can say it now because it’s really working on this and we should be able to see that a new bridge will be offered in the fall. ”
But does Helgi have any advice on the drivers who are in the waiting line at the River Alfus all day over the summer hour?
“ Yes, it is possible to go through the narrow line and through the ear tray, but it is faster than those who are going to the east, they cannot be directed to go to the Lyngdal Heath, but those who are going to the settlements should use Mosfellsheed, Congress and Lyngdal Heath. ”
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the town government of Årborg, which says the traffic congestion, which forms at the Elfusárbru of Selfoss tolerant.
A lot of waiting is made every day at the River Alfus, and drivers often have to wait for a considerable time to cross the bridge.
Then the only advice is to draw a deep breath and think something positive.
The future of restored koal bears in northern Brisbane is due to organizational judgment
The city government said that as the area was vital to life, the koals, the swifics, and the gray gáshauks would be an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
The Commissioners have appealed to the Court of Justice for the rejection of the Civil Service Act to the organization and the environment, with the evidence that the structure is in accordance with the Civil Service Act of 2014, would meet the organisational and social needs that have not been met to date and would “be carried out without undue influence”.
There is a great deal of opposition to these planned projects in the near environment.
The executives argue that although the proposal is fully in line with the organization, it could be changed if it did not meet requirements rather than reject them.
As is the case, the project includes many stages, including a service center, a child care centre, and 39 accommodations.
Public transmissions were more than 120 at the time of consultation, and most objected to the proposal where it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The minority leader of Brisbane’s city government said that the city had to buy the land to protect the koala bears.
“ Adrian Schrinner has to stop wasting taxpayers’ waters in a fight with the executives for judgment and buy this country to protect Brisbane’s natural and animal life, ” said Mayor Cassidy.
“ This is one of the most important homes in the mountain to Mangroves, where there are many koala bears. ”
Schrinner said this week that the city government wanted the Koal bear home to be protected.
“We didn’t think the proposal was suitable for the area,” said Schrinner.
“ I understand that this is now going through the judicial system, and obviously we hope that it will bring about a good and positive outcome that will preserve our home. ”
Schrinner said that a map of the homes of the koal bearers was the joint responsibility of the city government and government, but that the government was responsible for accurate maps of the homes of the koal bearers supported by local authorities when making applications for projects for treatment.
Sunshine: The next step is to work something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, coach Man Utd, was to hope that the team secured a third seat in the English Selection Department today.
The team will therefore play in Europe’s Championships in the next period.
United needed a tie or victory against Leicester today and was the result of the 2–0 victory of the Devil’s Red.
“ A great achievement for the players to reach a third place according to the situation during the period.
I think the boys and I might have gotten over a spiritual ridge by winning such a huge game, where we've lost twice in front of us during this period.
We knew that we needed the finals today, now we can start the next chapter that's with these boys to win titles," said Solskjær victories.
Manchester United still has a chance to win a title during this period, but the team plays in the European Union in August and is as good as the 8—joint finals there.
A truce begins at midnight in East Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — The Ukrainian Army and Opposition Forces in Eastern Ukraine are now preparing “a complete ceasefire ” to begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after 6 years of conflict.
On Sunday, representatives of the opposition said that they had ordered ceasefire and issued an order to ban the use of weapons.
The Ukrainian army said that its forces have been “preparing ” for the ceasefire.
If this is to be achieved, it would “ provide the way for the implementation of other regulations” of the Minsk Peace Agreement, as stated by the office of President Ukraine earlier this week, where the ceasefire was called a time-step.
The objective of the Minsk Peace Agreement, which was carried out in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the refugees who have been assisted by Russia, which began in 2014 following Russia's accession to the Crimea and its support for the separation.
More than 14,000 people have died in the battle.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine both welcomed the ceasefire on Sunday and stressed the importance of implementing the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Mr Putin, President of Russia, expressed concern about Kiev’s call for the Minks Agreement to be reviewed and said that the position of Mr Selensky, President Ukraine, “the indifference of the Minsk Agreement, which he once again expressed in this call, should be reflected in real action.”
Selenski, however, stressed the need to resort to “more frequent actions” to free the Ukrainian prisoners of rebels in East Ukraine, on the embassies of Crimea and Russia, as declared by the President’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only have jurisdiction over borders with Russia in the areas under the authority of the separatists when they have been granted extensive self-government rights and when elections have been held in the areas.
The convention reduced conflict, but Ukraine’s army and rebels have continued to take action.
When Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to hold other talks, the leaders were supported by the Minsk Agreement and agreed to relaunch the peace process.
Selenskij, who won the elections in 2019 with promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have control over the borders before the first regional elections, but the Kremlin government demands that the agreement be concluded without change.
The new ceasefire agreement was reached on Wednesday for the existence of a trilateral cooperation group, appointed representatives of Russia and Ukraine as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
On the traditional Sunday blasphemy of Peter’s Square, Pope Frans also mentioned the ceasefire and said that “trust must be rebuilt and the foundation laid for the very necessary and long - awaited reconciliation with the people. ”
Police: A man shot to death in protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death in protests in Texas as he approached a car and the driver in the car fired his weapon, according to the police.
The police spokesperson Katrina Ratliff told early Sunday that the shooting had taken place just before 22:00 p.m. at a protest in Austin.
The man was taken to a hospital, where he was later ordered to die.
The car had whistled, bent down the road and then speeded up the journey towards Protestants, the Witness Michael Capochiano said to the newspaper Austin American-Statesman.
According to Capochian, the man with a rifle approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratliff told reporters that the first reports indicated that “the victim may have had a rifle” and added that the suspect was in custody and was willing to cooperate with the police.
According to press reports, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The protests were streamed directly to Facebook, where they were heard in the whistle of the car and several shots that were fired.
Marka soup in the first victory of Blika in July
A moment won its first victory from June 29th, when the IA struck, 5-3, in the Pepsi Max Division of Men at the Kopavog Square tonight.
On the other hand, they lose their third game in a row in the division.
After winning their first three games in the division, Bjölk played five games without celebrating victory and had suffered three consecutive losses before the game at IA tonight.
It was, therefore, that you would do or die for Bika, who was very forceful to enter the game.
Alexander Helgi Sigurdarson led the team with a fine payment in 11 minutes after Kristin Steindorsson sent him through the defense of IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian doubled the lead after a very fine preparation of the left - edged Gísla Eyjólf son.
In the first half of the year, the Skagiers did not get any land or beach, where the pressure of the locals made them enormously difficult for connecting shipments.
Flashes had all the power in the field and cut the third mark in 36 minutes when Daninn Thomas Mikkelsen shot in the corner of the son of Gunnla.
Then Christ the son of Steindor scored his second mark, and the fourth mark was just three minutes later.
However, the story of the first half did not end there.
The Skaga people had hope for the second when Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored from the video game shortly before the playoff, but Kwame Quee had then broken the clumsy at Viktor Jons son within the teigs Bila.
Thus, 4-1 was the status of Bjölk when the semi-flatted bile was present.
Only three minutes had passed since the second half of the game, when the Skaga cut back.
The Hlynur Sævar son of Jon was then alone and unelected on the market of Blica and easily guided the ball into the net by the corner of Tryggva the son of Hrafen Harald.
However, when he broke down Alexander Helga, IA only took three minutes to break.
Vitaspyrna was convicted, and Thomas Mikkelsen made sure to come over 5-2 after only seven minutes of the second half.
Five minutes after the mark of the Greatness, the Skagians again cut off.
Anton Ari Einarsson, Blika's goalkeeper, hit them under pressure from Viktor son of Jon, gave the ball to Viktor's foot from where the ball was turned off in the net.
An incredible 5-3 score was seen when less than ten minutes had passed from the second half of the day, but the resulting target score was slowed down.
Despite the fine ability of both sides to add the limits, including two dead bodies of Kwame Quee from Bjölk, they did not become more and the 5–3 victory of the Bjölk final of the game.
A moment thus won its first victory for almost a month, from June 29, and is followed by the victory with 14 points in third place, two points from Val, the seat above and three from KR peak.
However, KR and Valur have both a game on Blika.
IA has to accept the third consecutive loss in the division, but the team has ten points in eight, five points from the base.
In spite of the White House’s comments, the gang did not put themselves at risk.
Yesterday, the Breeders were right not to stop showing the baby material in the near future.
The statement follows the statement by Kayleigh McEnany, the White House media representative, that the features of law - enforcement dogs included a victim of “cancel culture. ”
Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnany’s words and announced that their fans would have no need to worry about the future of the Ville band.
A number of television sets dealing with police activities have been taken out of the United States after protesting against police violence.
However, the gang is not included, despite the reputation of this material on the social media.
At a press conference in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that President Trump was opposed to “an exclusion culture, ” especially when the police arrived.
The term refers to the fact that people or companies speak or make hard reactions to social media and are called upon to avoid protesting.
“ A few weeks ago, we saw that shows on the Vänlpa force, child material on cops, were stopped.
It's the same with the elements Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
At that time, she added that Danish toy producer Lego took out a lawsuit, but there is no basis for that claim, according to the defenders of Lego.
However, it is true that the reality of Cops and Live PD has recently been removed from the Western Ocean.
For example, both participants are concerned about showing pictures of real police jobs without being allowed to appear in individuals there.
Together for 29 years - Sometimes jealousy and suspicion arise
Christian Tomazdaughter, a family therapist, answers questions about family issues, children, and love in the Family Corner DV.
This time, she answers readers who have never been single.
Since we were 15 years old, we have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We know nothing but to be together and we feel good, but we both have felt as if we were missing something.
We have never been with other people, and we have no comparison as to how this might be different.
This has sometimes led to jealousy and distrust as to whether the other person is looking around, thinking about adultery, or even divorce, and changing.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is such a nightmare that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for your excellent question, and I am very happy that you have such open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about it in each corner, couldn't talk about it, and even step up some step that you could so later regret.
Everything on the table, isn't it always the best?
A strong self - image is most predictive of happiness in the future and the stronger your self - image, the more likely you are to become a marriage mate with a strong self - image.
The reason why relationships that start in youth do not always last all their lives is often that people develop in each direction, but in those cases where there is a complementary effect, individuals can become stronger as a whole than many others.
As your relationship begins to develop during your most mature years, it can be concluded that you have developed together and have a positive influence on each other’s self - image.
For example, we are molded by the relationships we have.
The way I speak is shaped by the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relations shape who we are.
Could you turn the example around and think, ‘ What do we have that others don’t have? ’
What does this many years of specialty give us?
I allow myself to say that the benefits can be a lot more than the flaws.
For years, you have been molding each other, and for this reason, you can be said to be customized in millimeters.
That's more than a lot of people can say.
Worth it?
You are talking about the fact that you have missed something, but it is important to remind yourself that major changes such as divorce and a new relationship are also accompanied by accompanying fish that you are not necessarily excited about.
You may be missing out on a new start, on learning to be alone again, on getting to know a new person, and on putting together families.
This is accompanied by new challenges, a different problem, and possibly something new and exciting.
But this doesn't just come with pink clouds and happiness, no, at your age, this can become a piece of shit, which may never be as good as you've already done to each other.
Is it worth it?
Nor would it be advisable to put the focus on what you can do to increase tension, inescapability, and innovation in your relationship?
You haven't laid your shoes on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to make this your long relationship even deeper.
What efforts can you make in this regard?
What do you need from your mate, whom you are not receiving?
What can you do to your mate that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, there is much more tolerance to various forms of relationships, and couples are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, e.g., an open relationship, a multi-esteem, or decide to break up temporarily.
I'm not at all telling you what to do, because no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would lighten these heavy arsons that come over you, if you look up to this and think about solutions.
What do you need so little confidence and fear disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, it must mean you're capable of things together.
Use it as strength and remain in your hands toward your solution.
We encourage readers to send their questions and concerns to Kristin by e-mail to: jonabandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will be answered here in the family corner, of course anonymously and in full confidence.

It's a war!
Coleen Rooney hires a lawyer Johnny Depp in the Wagatha Christie bar at Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against the charges against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between the football partners were held, their acquaintances expected dramatism
Coleen Rooney has hired the Star Lawyer to defend himself in his so - called "Wagate Christie" dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday's simulation that Rooney commissioned David Sherborne to defend herself against the charges that she had been injured against Vardy, with claims that personal information was leaked to the media by her closed Instagram access.
The news comes a few days after the data was submitted to the Supreme Court, which states that Rebekah Vardy, who is married to the Witness Jamie Vardy in the football team Leicester City, suffered physically and spiritually following the claim of Coleen Rooney.
It states that the mother of 38 - year - old five children “have experienced severe hiding and panic attacks, so that she was afraid of going out of the house” and that Vardy, who was then seven months pregnant,“ has been hospitalized three times... because of a panic attack due to the introduction and consequences. ”
In addition to being a lawyer of Depp in his case against The Sun, because of claims that the actor beat his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, goes with the Duke and the Duke of Sussex in their private case against Associated Newspapers, publishers The Mail on Sunday.
After a peaceful discussion between the two football partners failed, those familiar with dramatism in the courtroom are expected.
“If you found the Depp trial to be a game of sight, don’t underestimate the future war of the football partners,” said one source.
“ Now it’s a real war, and Coleen doesn’t give up, and Becky doesn’t either.
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used Instagram access Rebekah Vardy had leaked up stories about her for a newspaper.
She was named “Wagatha Christie” after understanding how she spent five months gradually limiting the number of friends who could see updates to Instagram stories with her, until only Vardy’s account was left.
Coleen says that he had put a famous story on Instagram, which had since appeared in a gossip newspaper.
In Vardy’s case documents, which refuse to take part in the case, she argues that she was made a bleak after Rooney published the allegations “in a deliberate way, with the aim of causing great damage and tremendous suffering. ”

Biden's competition team refuses to “Fox News Sunday” about an interview one week after interview with Chris Wallace at Trump
In the last week’s interview with Chris Wallace, President Trump doubted that the forthcoming Presidential Prosecution of Democrats, Joe Biden, would handle the questioning code that Wallace had fallen upon Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least for now.
On Sunday, Wallace’s audience informed that Biden’s election team had told Fox News that he was “not available” for an interview.
“ In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his Democrat opponent, Joe Biden, would plum himself in similar circumstances, ” said Wallace.
“ During the week, Biden’s election party asked for an interview, and they said that the former Vice President was not available. ”
“ We keep asking each week, ” he added.
For months, Trump’s campaign has criticized Biden for avoiding election meetings and press meetings while he is attending interviews during the crowning epidemic.
Although Biden has recently begun his campaign again, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the former vice president for “hiding” in their Delaware home.
However, the reluctance of Biden to attend a public event has not been entertained by his offer, since recent surveys show that Biden has a good advantage over Trump in both national and major fighting states.
Real Clear Police reports that the president was 7 percent in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four countries in 2016 when he turned them over to the Republican Party when he won the struggle for the White House.
In the latest Fox News Poll survey, Biden is a frontline in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, outside of the field line in all cases.
Surveys also suggest that Biden has a slight advantage in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important battles in these elections.
And research suggests that a state that formerly was the stronghold of the Republicans, such as Texas and Georgia, is now divided between Trumps and the former vice president.
Presidential election in which the President of the White House invites himself to a second election period is often a vote for that President – and it seems to be the case now in 2020 in the struggle between Trumps and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the crowning virus and economics that are in decline because of the epidemic — and the performance and history of the president in both categories.
Kanye West and his argument with bipolar disorder
Today, the composer Kanye West apologized to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for the speech he had fallen into a man - made scandal.
The head of the Mental - Helper believes that he is taking his creative power in mental health, but a psychiatrist says that it is important for people to take drugs to keep their disease under control.
Rapparen Kanye West is not only one of the earliest and most influential musicians of the time, but he is not as famous as the husband of the reality star Kim Kardashian.
To a large extent, his personal life has been open.
He announced earlier this month that he would be proud to invite himself to the president of the United States, and he gave an emotional and dismal talk.
Later on, on Twitter, some of his peculiar attires appeared, claiming that his wife was trying to get him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram asking people to show understanding to her husband and family; he had bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to seek help himself.
He has since officially apologized to her.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people get psychosis.
Ferdinand Jonsson is a head doctor in a hospital in London, and he knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause so much distress to individuals and especially to their families and loved ones.
This mania can destroy relationships and work and cause unbearable sorrow.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often very dangerous, because there's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice for her to say that.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
The corner of Unnsteinsson, director of Psychotherapy, has struggled with psychosis — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very bright imagination.
If we are four strings of grounded double bass, then he is one hundred strings of heavenly harp.
And he's so overly creative, overly powerful and smart in his powerful thought of connection, because you'll be aware of this kind of thought that we've been given to try to go in a manic state so well know."
Kanye West doesn't want to take mental medicine, because he thinks they're reducing his creativity.
He has discussed the psychosis, including on the record Ye.
The side says that it is his choice not to take a medicine.
“ People feel that it is a source of this creative element, which is involved in this unwavering thought of connection and superpower of the fire he has, but that is the natural flaws of it often a great deal of suffering, and of the elder valleys, and of the dark cellars and darkness. ”
However, Ferdinand says that it is important for people with bipolar disorder to be treated.
“ If you have a lot of presumptuousness or mania, you’re not making anything wonderful, you’re just on your side.
And just like when people go into severe depression, people are totally paralysed by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take a medicine?
“ Finally, ” says Ferdinand.
“ And especially to work with someone to find the right dosages and this way that there will be a balance between that medicine helping him as much as possible and ruining as a memory of him and his abilities and his creative powers. ”

Delhi Metro casts the first pillar on stage four
Delhi Metro reached an important fourth stage when the first pillar was cast for the route between Janakpur West and R K Ashram Marg, which is being laid, according to a staff member on Sunday.
The chair was cast in Keshop and on an up - to - date part between Keshop and Mucarba Chowk on Saturday night.
“Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) took another important step in the fourth stage of the implementation, the first pillar at this stage of the expansion of the train system was dashed for the route between Janakpur West and R K Ashram Marg,” stated the DMRC statement.
In spite of a large shortage of labour and other organizational challenges caused by the pandemic, this “great workman ” was achieved.
The average height of the pole this way is 10 meters.
On the other hand, the poles will be 20 metres high at Madhuban Chowk, where the road intersects at route 1, and 25 meters at Haiderpur Badli Mother, where the road meets route 2.
At Haiderpur Badli Mother, the bridge road is 28 meters high, which is the highest in Dehli Metro’s history, as stated in the declaration.
The highest point of the train system is located at Dhaula Kuan, where a bridgeway leads 7 to a height of 23.6 m.
In the context of construction engineering, pillars are a relatively stress - bearing human activity that supports the adjacent ends of two paths.
They form a vertical human activity that reveals the elevated bridge of the rail system.
These pillars can be seen in the countless major railways under the Deli rail systems.
The number of the chair now plays an important role as a landmark for addresses in the Deli-largest city area.
The 28.92 km long route from Janakpuri West to R K Ahsram Marg is growing on the Magenta route and on it will be 22 stops.

On June 24, the DMRC began to cast up U-bits that would later be placed on the raised section of the route.
At the fourth stage of the implementation, 61.679 km of new trains will be provided with three different routes with 45 train stations.
These new parts will offer connections between the parts of the train system already operated by Delhi Metro.
Of these, 22.35 km below ground, while other parts are raised.

"Supplied" ambassador wants a gun, a armored car, and a stabbing vest - said the underlings were the ambassadors of the "Depth State"
Politically appointed U.S. ambassador, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, who said he wanted to carry a gun on him in CBS news today.
In effect, CBS reported: “Although in one of the safest states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is “a friend of his since he came to Reykjavík last year. ”
Refers CBS to 12 diplomas, government officials, and former representatives, as well as individuals who are familiar with the case.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that they ask for permission for the cousin’s ambassador to walk through an armed country.
He should also have wanted an armored car to travel with him between Iceland’s places and the pit vest.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to express its views on whether there was a threat to the safety of the ambassador, although representatives of the U.S. government said that the ambassador was expressed that Iceland was a safe country and that it was safe here.
However, there would have been a publication of lifeguards in Icelandic magazines, says CBS, and if it would have helped to meet the ambassador’s demands.
The CBS report says that the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on the issue with CBS.
On the other hand, the U.S. News Office, after its sources in this country, has said that no request has been made to the provinces of the government.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of by walking through an armed force, where it would insult the State of Bed and Breakfast, Iceland.
The ambassador was given his honor for supporting richly at Donald Trump’s election fund in the 2016 presidential elections.
Before, he was a dermatologist in California.
Since Gunter took office in May when he said that he has made a “inconvenient” job environment in the embassy, and he has already had seven subcontractors, known as the Deputy Chief of Mission, the ambassador’s subcontractors who are also sent out to the diplomats.
They were all tested diplomats from the U.S. State Department.
The first one was sent away by the ambassador “because he did not like his appearance. ”
Had he already prepared for a year and learned Icelandic?
The next one lasted only six months.
As a result, it was designed to root out staff, and the thought was to let Gunter try as much as he could until he looked at one of them.
Furthermore, CBS says that Gunter loved the embassy’s staff to pursue the “deep State ” mission and to undermine it with regard to the State Department in Washington, D.C.
The officials of the State Department of D.C. are well aware of the situation in their embassy in Reykjavík, but have been reluctant to take action against the lack of government in the light of Gunter’s relationship with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had difficulty following the orders of the State Department in Washington, and it is said that he refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 traveling.
He left the embassy in the hands of his staff for months.
When he is said to have planned to work from his home in California, unless appointed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Switching Back at End
Finally, the order was received, Gunter turned back to Iceland in May.
His new member, Michelle Yerkin, then came to the country this month.
CBS has not received an answer to their enquiries to the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to communicate with CBS, nor did DV.
Gunter is one of the many political ambassadors of the Trump government who has been paying attention to unusual behavior in the past few months.
Woody Johnson’s reaction was when the day came that he was trying to get the British to open the golf championship to the golf course in Trump’s possession.
The ambassador of South Africa has also been accused of running his number two man and then tried to appoint her son to the job.
42% of the ambassadors of the United States are political.
Thirty percent were politically appointed to Obama’s government, and 32 percent to George W. Bush’s government.
Protestants and police together in Seattle because Trump's plans to send the Feds to the Feds
The Seattle police used bombs and pepper sprays on Protestants who set off a motorcycle for young people in prison on Saturday, following a wave of anger among the public because of President Donald Trump’s plans to send the federal forces into major cities.
Repeated bombings roamed through the streets of Seattle City in Washington, and smoke came from the place where Protestants had burned into wheelchairs on the construction site at the juvenile prison.
The Protestants cut a car deck and broke a window in a trailer.
A police officer used protesters, some of whom held up umbrellas to protect themselves from the pepper spray capsules that rained over them.
The Seattle Times reported that 16 were arrested for suspected attacks on police officers, for preventing police duties, or for refusing to leave the area.
Poland will report on the European Convention for the Prevention of Violence Against Women
Poland’s right government says that the country will withdraw from the European agreement to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Agreement is the world’s first binding legal act, which aims to prevent violence against women, but the Minister of Justice of Poland, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “harmful” in requiring schools to teach children about sex from a social point of view.
During the weekend, Ziobro said that on Monday, he would begin to prepare a formal process for the country to comment on the agreement.
“ This ideological factor is linked to attempts to change education in schools and leisure activities, in terms of study, attitude, and conviction of a young generation of Poland, based on the conclusion that our opinion is wrong, that biological gender is old-fashioned and that everything is really about social culture. ”
Ziobro believes that the provisions on education and training of children and young people as well as family ties in the context of LGBT people are unacceptable.
“We also reject the LGBT factor in the discussion about family relations, because this is an opinion that is held by left-wing gays or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to become binding laws,” he said.
On Sunday, the European Council said that it was “treasury” about Poland’s mockery of the agreement.
In Warsaw, on Friday about 2,000 people, including women and other groups of people with rights, protested, apart from the offices of the right - side organizations Ordo Luris, who support the country’s termination of the agreement.
"We won't be victims," called them.
Objections also occurred in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Agreement to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, Engineer at the House of Honor, died 81 years ago
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, which was part of a quarter - mile - mile - mile - mile - mile - mile - mile - mile - mile - mile - mile - mile - size power, including his father Lee and his brother Richard, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While other members of his family were snuffed for their abilities behind the wheel, Maurice Petty entered the nickname “The Star” for his abilities with the screwdriver.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven titles in NASCAR, and he also built machines that assured the Honorary Queen Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton victory.
“ The manager was one of NASCAR’s most powerful mechanics, ” said the director and manager Jim France.
“ He came with the power that helped Petty Enterprises to achieve their excellence in the field of sports.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also played various roles behind the tents and did what was necessary to get his cars on the winning track."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the racetrack when he was little and his knowledge of machine activation soon became a major factor in landing Lee Petty in 54 races and three championships.
He competed 26 times in NASCAR in 1960-64, was seven times in the top five seats, and 16 times in the top ten.
However, he soon decided to focus on what happened under the hood rather than behind the wheel, which proved to be a good track for his older brother, who relied on his machine in his triumphal procession.
Richard, then known as the King, won the first championship with the Master in 1964 with the Plymouth Car.
They won back in 1967, then two years in a series of 1970 and 1971, reaching three additional titles before the eighth decade was over.
With these seven titles on their back, they shared the highest number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and was involved in his career at Petty Enterprises in building one of NASCAR’s top teams,” said Winston Kelley in a declaration.
“ Although Petty’s victory is recorded as 212, it calls for over 250 victories, if taken with all the machines he built for his rivals.
The boss will be remembered forever as one of NASCAR's greatest mechanics."
Lee Petty died in 2000 and Patricia, the wife of Maurice Petty to 52 years of age, died in 2014.
He was also a former driver’s uncle, and the mediaman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, a leader in the truck race.
“ Although we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and effective pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and name will be stored in our memories, kept in the air, and preserved forever, ” Kelley said.
"We're sending our deepest sympathy to the Petty family."

I would like to thank every fan for the support over the years, the partner for giving me the opportunity to wear blue, and my teammates.
You will always take place in my heart.

Serbia wants to grow military aircraft in ever-growing tension in the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more military aircraft as tension increases in the Balkans, said the president of Serbia on Sunday.
President Aleksandar Vucic said that “certain efforts” were going on to buy fleeting fighters, and accused the United States and other Western states of having armed Serbia’s neighboring state in NATO, as well as Kosovo, formerly ruling in Serbia.
“ The Americans, the Turks, and the Germans take care of their beloved seed, ” Vucic said, pointing to Cosovo.
He said that the United States had recently delivered a number of armed cars to the Kosovo security forces.
During a campaign on the Serbian Armed Forces, Vucic said that his people cannot compete with “the contribution of NATO” to the arms range of their neighbors and that“ this is why we are up to ourselves. ”
Vucic did not specify the type of military aircraft Serbia had to buy, but the media sideways governments say his government has officially requested the delivery of 20 attack aircraft from the United States.
It appears that Washington did not receive an answer to the request from Belgrade and that if it is rejected, it is likely that an attack plane of the Sukhoi-25 type from Russia will be purchased.
Serbia, who maintains a policy of neutrality in military matters, has recently been supplied with a highly developed air - protection system from Russia, which has also provided battle jets, attack helicopters, and armed vehicles.
China, which is also Serbia’s alliance, has provided the state with the dragons for military use.
U.S. officials have discussed openly to put in place sanctions against Serbia if more weapons come to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could endanger the security of neighbouring NATO Member States.
In the West and in the neighboring kingdoms of Serbia, people look at the weapons of Russia and China in Serbia.
Tensile tension is now increasing in the Balkans, which was dependent on a man - made civil war in the 1990 ’ s.
The Atlantic Alliance had an exchange of Serbia to stop Serba bloodshed against the Kosovo-Albana divorce campaign in 1999.
Despite formal efforts to join the European Union, Serbia’s populace has further strengthened its political and military relationship with Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not accept the independence of Kosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have accepted.
Heart attack: The likelihood of this fatal condition may be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that some kindness may be good for the heart muscle.
And how could it reduce the chance of a heart attack?
Scientists have performed a meta-analysis of coronary artery disease of over 50 years.
The main symptoms of coronary artery disease (also called ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina pectoris), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include palpitations and severe shortness of breath.
“Success contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoids, methylxanthine, polyphenol and stearic acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also called high density lipoprotein, collects “bad” cholesterol – a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart – and moves it into the liver.
The “bad” cholesterol (low density lipoprotein) is broken down in the liver and then removed from the body.
However, the new study does not investigate the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether participants ate dark chocolate, lactose, or other cocoa.
The results were based on an earlier study that concluded that the consumption of sucrose (as found in chocolate) reduced the chance of a heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vascular function refers to how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients around the body and removes waste.
No life-style factors were identified in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the evidence that those who had admitted to eat chocolate would be more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and experience less stress.
“ Each of these factors could have an independent impact on the health of the cardiovascular system, ” she added.
Coles divides plastic toys out of books on a new fundraiser campaign
“ We’ve really listened, and that was a key point in preparing a project, ” said Ronson.
“ We don’t believe that people want to recycle the books — we believe that they will own them, but they can be recycled at home if they want to. ”
Ronson said that the new campaign has been working long before COVID-19 came into existence, and despite the danger, she believes that the timing of the new campaign was “very good ” because of the time that parents now spend with their children.
The researchers have expressed concern because consumers have become tired of the ever - increasing toy - collection campaign of the largest major marketers, while Ronson says that there is no evidence of fatigue yet.
“ We haven’t seen anything like that yet, but we keep our eyes open, ” she said.
“ We track down a lot of data, from week to week, months to month, to ensure that what we give away finds harmony with our customers.
It was Cloes who laid the track for gathering campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first in my year 2018 was the driving force behind the best annual quarter sales of the big market from the beginning.
Woolworths followed along with Lion King Oosheis, who helped the big market also to their grander sales, and now the last time the environmental campaign Discovery Garden offers customers free plants and flowers for planting.
However, this time the new assembly campaign could have less impact, as UBS publishers predict an increase in sales in large markets in Australia over most of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said that customers can expect more diverse gathering campaigns in the future and that military campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to be less frequent.
“ There’s a lot about gathering campaigns in many parts of the world that we look at, and we keep getting inspiration from other countries, ” she said.
“We need to do it to make sure that we keep doing better with our customers. ”
5 laps around the country this summer
The photographer and the material manufacturer Jon Ragnar Jonsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and less famous in Iceland since the pandemic.
John completed a field study at the University of Reykjavík, a few years ago, but he now works to travel and produce marketing material for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early with Joni, or in April, when he traveled throughout the West and stayed in his car.
The rest of the year, he's gone about five or six times around the country.
Besides, he's been on countless day trips here and there.
What trip has taken place?
“ For someone like me, who is always on a plane and has seen everything, it’s hard to name a favorite place.
It is more the weather and the company that matters.
After they opened up in June, they have recently reached highlands.
They always stand up because it is so much adventure to reach their destination.
The last trip there is a possible favourite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together on five large cars up by Riverside and from there to River Lake."
What is ahead of you this summer?
“ I have a lot of excitement in my life, but I was finishing a choking course with DIVE and now taking suffocation trips here and there around Iceland.
Then I was adding surfboards to the “Dotting Truth” with me, so I get more into the sea than before.
I am so heading for a 10 - day “solo” journey with everything I need my back, but it will show up later in summer where I go.
Otherwise, I'll be a lot on highlands in the near future, as there's no way to look at that area all year long."
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
“ I always find it difficult to choose a place, but the Jökolklarlon has been part of my life since I remember.
My family and I spent every summer living at the foot of Björkarkokul, and since then I have always been well in that area.
I think it's safe to say that I've been there over 100 times."
What place in Iceland do you recommend that people visit?
“ I’m going to bring one pearl from each part of the country, but it’s the one part of the country that I’m going to bring, in Southland, in East, in North, in North, in West, in West, in North and last but not least,... in highlands. ”
What is indispensable for the journey?
“I’m not going to land unless I have the following: good flashlights, hangovers, lopapeys, fishing knifes, scarboxes, refrigerators, and ewes... those who know me know what I’m talking about. ”
Searching for 24 roes of fear of drowning from an island in Malaysia
KUALA LUMPUL, Malaysia (AP) — On Sunday, the government of Malawi said that it was a search for 25 rosy refugees who fear that after dropping off a boat from Langkawi, a tourist island in Malaysia, who is north of Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high - ranking officer of the Malasian National Court, said that the first police information showed that only one of the 25 men who had run off the boat had been able to swim to land.
The man who survived sought help from the police late Saturday and has been held while the matter is being investigated, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim minions have fled Myanmar for military operations, and many of them live in a crowded refugee camp in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the inhabitants of Malaysia, which has been a frequent destination for boats that promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and aircraft were used for the search.
He said that the territorial services also bear witness to seamen in the area and authorities in the neighbouring land of Thailand so that they can assist in their search.
He didn't give any more information about the boat.
Last month, the authorities in Malaysia brought 269 rosy refugees into custody and found a body aboard a ship suspected of being used to smuggle off the coasts of Langkawi, which required him to be damaged willingly so that he could not return to the sea.
Malazia’s territorial sanctuaries later stated that 269 persons were transferred from a larger ship with dozens of people who are thought to have died and that their bodies were thrown into the sea.
The prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malazia could not accept any more rosy refugees because it is economically infested by the crown virus epidemic.
He said, however, that those who are already in the land would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, there are over 2 million illegal immigrants, as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers — including 101,000 slanderers — registered at the United Nations Refugee Institute.
Residents in Aswan collect, watch and return a cargo of chocolate to Sudan after a car landing
The transfer to Sudan with many tons of chocolate selected on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the crossroads of the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell into a coma due to a heat stroke.
The people of the town flocked to help the driver where he was lying and to save the goods that had been sold.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position as “the driver passing by our village; we could not just stand by.
We're supposed to help people in distress, no matter where they come from."
He added that villagers had come on an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the truck’s cargo, estimated at three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr said villagers have been on the scene from morning to evening and saved as much of the cargo as they could.
“ What we thought most important was saving the driver’s life, protecting the cargo, and opening the international road again, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the injured driver with water and shelter, said Bahr, adding that they just wanted to make sure he got to and from the village safe.
There were already cataclysms in the council, and the crown virus could make them worse.
“ The global epidemic alone calls for our elected representatives to take the lead and vision we expect in times of difficulty, ” says a report produced by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communication studies at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“ But we are also faced with other debts that are related to the inherited sin of our people and to the racial inequality that has plagued our country from its establishment. ”
The study examines familiar subjects related to the pathetic state of the Congress: lack of real links between classes, a schedule that limits communication opportunities, over-compression of power in leadership stations, constant demands for finance, intergroupial data, negative effects of the media that are operating throughout the day, the fact that the most important elections for congressmen are often foresight and finally the silence of minorities.
It is also warned that the Congress is moving more into the Internet because of the pandemic, where such a system, which allows the election by means of replacements in the representative department without the need for congressmen to travel to Washington, could still increase the problems that exist.
If the idea of remote assembly reaches its base, it would be a serious setback for attempts to increase inter-group communication, as stated in the report.
“ The U.S. epidemic caused the Congress to move most of its activities to the Internet, and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
“ But even though it was necessary, it should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The document says that the Congress needs “more, but not less, communication between the congressmen, face to face. ”
They need to learn more about one another's districts, have polite conversations to find common surfaces and build a relationship based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
In particular, the call for politeness was made during the week when Mr. Ted Yoho, Senator of the Republicans of Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator of the Democratic Republic of New York with actions and his associates in the Republican Party, agreed to attack Liz Cheney, Senator of the Republican in Wyoming with hostile words.
Congresswoman Val Demings talks about the vice president, let Trump hear it from favors
The Congresswoman Val Demings (democracy, Florida) was not shy about discussing her interest in the office of vice president of the possible government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere gratitude for being accepted for the office.
This respected member of the Congress group of the blacks was interviewed with BlackPressUSA in a live broadcast because of the #FIYAH! The live factor and told about her story, energy and commitment that brought her to the place she is in today, beginning with the words “You know all my history. I grew up as a daughter of maid and housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida.”
Demings was one of the four defendants of the representative assembly in the trial of Donald Trump in the Senate in January.
Regardless of whether the Senate infected Trump, it will be recorded in the story that he is the fourth president charged.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, the former prosecutor of the council noted: “Was this worth it? It has been worth it every day. ”
She added that despite the disappointment of the decision, democrats would have been obliged to follow the case regardless of its outcome.
In the interview, Demings made it clear that she is opposed to Trump in the prison sentence of Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying before the Congress (including other crimes) as well as his mercy on other criminals who were convicted of similar crimes, when she said “The inaction of reaching your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover your iniquities.”
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of potential candidates for Vice Presidents, which also holds Karen Bass President CBC (democrats, California), Stacey Abram's former Congressman of Georgia, the Congressman Kamölu Harris (democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms Mayor Atlanta, Susan Rice, former ambassador of the United States and several others.
She noted, however, that only one person would decide who would volunteer with Joe Biden in the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she brought her hand to her mouth while she laughed and was whispering to those who looked at the live broadcast, adding, “If you want to call... you can do it for me. ”
There is no doubt that regardless of their political views, history books will consider this period as a time when American politics and attitudes developed.
It didn't go wrong with Demings.
She pointed out that the number of women involved — especially for women of African origin — is an opportunity to break through what remains of the “glass roof. ”
“ It’s exactly this opportunity that I’m working so hard on my whole life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they’re of the wrong sex, ” she said.
The Congresswoman intended to ensure that the Democratic Party’s National Committee and the election team Biden would advertise and work with Black Press of America to get as many people to vote as possible.
“I’ll call Tom Perez (President of the Democratic Party) and I’ll put this at the top of my list,” promised Deming.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the election campaign.
When she answered the words of former foreign minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he loses his election, and another editorial that says that the president is preparing to receive himself lived over Demings: “To the extent that I suggest that I should receive myself made me sick. ”
“ But who would ever do that other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to break laws and ignore the constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he can't stand losing.
I can believe that the president will not want to leave the White House, but we have our way to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those who let it happen."
Tetanus on the feet for children
There are slippers for those children who want to make a toast to their parents from their early age in bottles that fit the table in better days.
No doubt there are some parents who rejoice — or the parents who have had a way in their babysitters with ornaments.
But it is as if the children are reaching out for their parents ’ glasses, for they are more exciting to see on their feet.
These discussed glasses we ran into on the modernhousessentials.com page, which contains various gold moles.
The bottles have a good butt, steady foot, and they can withstand a lot of heat. So kids can enjoy soaps, whether it's hot or cold.
Each bottle contains approximately 150 ml.
Those who want to look at the glasses can look into the HIR website, but the bottles are on offer for these days at a small $3,400 in Icelandic.
Alibaba and Jack Ma are headed to court in Gurugram for a former employee
Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been brought to justice in Gurugram after the company’s former employee claimed that he had been driven to protest against editorials and false news in the company’s programs.
The case is set out in Gurugram’s District Court and the private court judge Sonia Sheokand has issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and more than 10 others and asked them to appear in court on July 29, according to news.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, takes up the 268 000 US Valley in damages, according to court documents.
“We are committed to the company’s commitment to the Indian market and the well-being of its employees, and its policies are in accordance with applicable law.
We cannot express ourselves about the ongoing process," said the UC India in a declaration.
“ The petition also contains “a list of sensitive words ” that contain a password in Hindu and English such as “the border between India and China” and“ the war between China and India” that is stated in the complaint that UC Web uses to publish material on its systems in India, ” says Reuters.
Last month, the Ministry of the Interior banned 59 Chinese mobile phones, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with increased tension between the two countries.
New York City’s firefighter’s representative says that it is “absolutely” right to exclude a white fireman from honorary.
According to a new report, a representative who deals with issues of diversity with the fireman of New York City says that it is “absolutely” right to keep a white fireman away from honorary values so that flag bearers can all be black.
White firefighter Daniel McWilliams has raised a case of racial discrimination after being taken from a group of flags at a memorial fair in November 2017 to remember the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a brotherhood of black firefighters.
Furthermore, according to the New York Post, the primary representative of the fire department in the field of diversity and accessibility, Lawyer Cecilia Loving, defended the decision in the hearing of the New York State Human Rights Department.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters of the League who, in a historical image, is seen lifting the American flag at Ground Zero during the days following the September 11 attack.
According to McWilliam’s case, the fire department had chosen him to be the only flag bearer in honor of the memorial ceremony.
Being a flagbarian at this ceremony was “great honor and privilege ” for McWilliams, according to CNN.
When he attended the ceremony, however, he was not allowed to participate in the honour of the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for as it were claimed, she had asked for all the flags at the Mass to be black.
She then asked McWilliams - a 29-year-old employee who was a fireman in New York City - to help in another way."
Amongst the claims that she asked him to do is to escort the civilians and set the uniform firefighters away from the Mass.
McWilliams claims that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of honor because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was, he said.
Wilson, who has served at the fire of New York City for 21 years and who also participated in the rescue work on September 11, will have exchanged McWilliams for one of Vulcan’s members.
McWilliams claims that he left the Memorial “to spare himself from further shame, humiliation, and shame, ” when friends and fellow workers heard what went between them, according to New York Daily News.
When Love, who is black, testified in court, asked McWilliam’s lawyer, Keith Sullivan, the following: “To pray that everyone is black in honor is not disparate? ”
“ No, it’s not, ” said Love, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it would be okay to ask that everyone be black in honor, which she replied: “Absolutely. ”
Loving explained that it would be okay to divide a white person out of a black person “to raise our specialties and different backgrounds in order to create pride, unity and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first filed a complaint for discrimination based on race by New York City Fire Force in January 2018.
He then filed a case against Wilson, the fireman of New York City, New York City and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliam made his complaint, Wilson’s supporters had avenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid hands on McWilliams, saying: “I have heard of you, they told me that you would behave like this, and now you know who I am. ”
In an exodus, Sullivan wrote that it had been “disturbed” to exclude McWilliams from honor at the fair and evidence that one was not valid for all of the fire.
“ If you are a black person and you differ from a white person at work, ” said Sullivan.
Wilson received “one hour’s advice” on her treatment with McWilliam.
Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a black person receives “mighty punishment, ” wrote Sullivan.
“The fire of New York City has created policies and processes that are intended to please members of the Vulcan Society, who conduct themselves in a racist way, excuse their actions and help them... and this has to stop,” wrote Sullivan.
A fear - inspiring roadman, demanding money
One was arrested in the city after a robbery attempt, threatening a pedestrian and trying to get money from the person.
The man was stored in a prison cell.
At that time, a man with a knife was reported in the middle of town.
The knife was confiscated and reported.
Over eighty cases entered the police board of the capital city area from 17 to 05 and were stored in a prison cell this morning.
Among other things, police stopped a driver’s car, who pulled a trailer at Kjalarnesi, where the wheelchair’s equipment was in a very bad condition.
The trailer was stationary and was intended by the owner to provide transport equipment to move it into town.
Then the police stopped the production of drugs in the Year.
Two were arrested for the matter, and they were released after the report.
There was also a report about people who shot up fireworks in the Yearby.
When the police arrived, they had already escaped from the scene “the shame that is still a long way to go. ”
Thousands of inhabitants of Khabarovsk still demand the resignation of Putin
Thousands of civilians led the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and objected to the arrest of the governor of the joint district of East Russia and the insertion of his successor, who has never lived in the province.
A former governor, Sergei Furgal, who was very popular, and tens of thousands of people protested when he was arrested and taken into custody in Moscow earlier this month, accused of having ordered the murder of three businessmen 15 years ago.
During the recent week, Furgal was formally replaced by the governor and his 39 - year - old class brother Mikhail Degtyarev, who was appointed to replace him, at the very little homage of the locals.
When Degtaryev was told inexperienced, and worse, without any connection to Khabarovsk, the inhabitants called his resignation the first.
They have been called Degtaryev as a wind around his ears.
The Protestants yesterday were little less than the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the release of Furgal and the release of Mr Putin, President of Russia.
“We want the governor to be released, because we think his arrests are very likely to be illegal,” has the AFP News Office after 30 years of protest, Alina Slepovu.
She claims that the agents of the Kremlin had Furgal arrested “to defend their own interests, but not the interests of the province. ”
A police force in Khabarovsk had Protestants disdained even though the requirement was a cloudless violation of the current ban on the Corona virus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, at least ten people were arrested by the police who met at Pusjkin Square to show Protestant support in Khabarovsk, says in the British newspaper Guardian.
Furgal's Party, the Free-Horse Democratic Party of Russia, is a group of tyranny-nationalists, and political commentators are considered to be somewhat loyal to the Kremlin regime in most cases.
On the other hand, the same political commentators inform the BBC that the victory of Furgal in the governorial elections two years ago — a great and undisputed — had been a major shock for Putin and United Russia, and yet it suggests that the arrest of the Kremlin in the East was weakening.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he awaits trial.
He is accused of ordering three murders during 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were present, but the third went out of the midst of them.
Sarah Rainsford, a reporter of the BBC in Moscow, says Furgal’s followers, who are very popular at home, convinced that the charge and arrest have a political origin.
They want to know why the government has waited to arrest him until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged crime.
Tree branches went by when the hurricane Hanna was riding over South Texas
The Hurricane Hanna fell into the strength of tropical storm after he landed on the shores of southern Texas on Saturday, July 25, but the government warned that the storm could still cause man - made floods.
The U.S. Weather Service said that great rainfall was the greatest threat in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico, as the storm moved west-south west on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this video on Twitter and told Storyful that he had taken it outside his home in Combes, Texas on Sunday morning.
Homeless women with disabilities participate in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman who is educated as a clothing pack, visits 250 homes each day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid infected area in Chennai, where approximately 10,000 cases have been reported.
The workday begins early at 7:30, and ends at about 16.
It measures the heat in the population, asks for symptoms, and teaches them the importance of using masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping away from others.
In fact, her work has led to an early diagnosis and treatment of infection in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 Chennai’s employees who care for their homework but are not healthcare professionals.
According to the authorities, the project has contributed to a 50 - percent reduction in positive cases, in the daily count of Chennai, while they are growing in other regions of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says that not all residents cooperate.
She adds: “Most people are cooperative when a disabled woman approaches them.
Some, though, become irritated.
This is not to worry about.
I think people should be safe.
When I come back the next day, the people are polite.
It helps build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the streets of the city for women with disability and fight against the Covid-19 team.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who also has disability, has also participated in the campaign as an overseer.
Although Kavitha has a specially designed wheel, she begins to meet people and hold her hedges.
“ I’m happy, ” she says about the reduction in infection, but she adds: “I want to see them go down to maybe about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can get it."
At the first height of the gistyl, where the two live, Matilda Funceca, a basketball woman using a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, send all the data from about 40 women to Chennai’s web server.
Matilda does not say that she is afraid of infection with the crown virus.
“ When we help others, God protects us, ” she adds.
When Manimekalai is asked what steps she takes, she says: “I use a mask, keep away, and often wash my hands.
I also drink Cabasura Kudineer, a Siddha drink that promotes the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first arrived at Chennai, these disabled women observed their time and ability to sew masks for health - care professionals in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the director of the Gistyl, as well as the Dorcas research station that runs the cloud, say: “They adjust to the needs of each hour.
In the past, masks were missing, and they did not leave behind.
Now it is time to intervene in the community, and then they answered the call."
Coronavirus infection in Tamil Nadu has now reached 200,000 after 6989 new cases in the past 24 hours, but it is also the highest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine have died and 7758 have recovered in the past 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206,737.
Police are trying to find out the last trip of a youth in Helensburgh
Investigators investigating the death of a youth in Helensburgh are now trying to set a timeline for his last trips.
The body of the 19 - year - old Church Allan was found in a home in Johnson Court at 6:25 a.m. on Saturday.
A 30 - year - old man was arrested, and the police confirmed on Sunday that he was now accused of death.
He'll be in court in Dumbarton on Monday.
Police chief Steve Martin said: “Our body is with Kirk’s family and friends in these difficult times.
Police will continue to work with the community and support it.
Our research is focused on getting a full picture of what happened, especially the journeys of Kirk during the last days before his death, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report their experience of discrimination
In the last few weeks, it has become clear that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial rights in sports in South Africa.
A upbuilding conversation must take place, and action must be taken to welcome everyone in sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former proteas crooked star, let his former white companions hear it and accused them of racial prejudice by saying he and other black soldiers are “wets. ”
Prince said that Protea’s black players have been officially named “wet players” by their white teammates.
He added that it was sad that even though black players like Makhaya Ntini and now reserving Rabada, some people still connected with their quota discussion.
Prince, now coach of the Cape Cobras team, had these comments dropped on the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organizations (UCSCBO) website on Thursday night.
The purpose of the organizations is to continue the firefight discussion of historical racial rights in South African sports.
“ As I said when I was relieved of social media, it’s not my intention to come and draw people’s names down in the sweat, but these are real incidents...
"You're doing everything right, but you're still getting infected."
Paul Roberts, a former musician and builder who became a NASA programmer, is now working with a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at the Methodist Hospital who looks at himself as an optimistic person, held out an amateur magazine on the Internet and attended a Comic Con event earlier in years.
Once a week, they're punching with their two daughters, their son-in-law, and a 7-year-old granddaughter, and playing intensely Uno games.
“ They are amazing geeks, ” says Roman, 38 years old, about their parents.
Sheryl Roberts, aged 65, is aware of the risks of the pandemic — diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put it at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a catheter that holds the previously blocked coronary artery open.
“We’ve been so careful, very careful, and kept away from people, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began working from home in spring, when the circuit fought hard in Washington, New York, and other parts of the country.
Paul has occasionally gone to the big market during “gamalennatime”, and the only real date they had in recent months was according to Sheryl when they began to look at wild flowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also careful.
But then she came home from work one day in the middle of June and thought she was allergic.
Soon she experienced cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all taste and smell, typical of the crown virus.
“ She said, “I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I had a mask, had gloves, washed my hands,” said Sheryl.
“ You do everything right, but still get infected. ”
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with positive crown virus infection, did not become seriously ill.
However, the situation became much worse with her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began to sneeze and then cough, just as their daughter did, and they had so much heat and pain in the body.
Then, “he became severely ill, disciplined quickly, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he became confused.
She was worried about his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency convention, for the second time in two days.
The former royal couple felt that it was “hidden” in the Queen’s Christmas speech, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaphrin found his grandmother, Queen Bretad, “averting” them in his Christmas speech.
The couple’s new life story, “Finding Freedom, ” states that they were identified as overlooking those in the library as seen in the Christmas talk.
The pictures on the desk of the queen’s office included Vilhjällm Bretaphrin, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretaphrin, and Kamilla’s wife, as well as Prince Philip.
Yet, Meghan and Harry were not seeing despite Archie’s birth in May, yet they were mentioned as her “spoken granddaughter, ” her Majesty.
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton “were never friends, ” where they“ struggled hard to cross surface politely, ” and met only a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that Harry and his brother William began some years before his relationship with Meghan began, but this peaked because of William and Kate Middleton’s marriage.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a “behaviour ” at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and it is claimed that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came into existence. ”
The Constituencies of the Iberian Party accuse the workers’ leaders of wanting to keep public employees “world forever. ”
Congressmen of the Iberian Party accuse workers of wanting public employees to be “worldly forever,” after the leaders objected to Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work
Labour force officers were accused of wanting to work “at home forever” after protesting against Boris Johnson’s call to return to work.
The representatives of the Italian Party were angry when the civil society of the public and public workers told their fellow workers to come to their feet when their superiors ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Former Minister Andrew Percy said that the necessary public service, such as the version of passports, would be stopped while general market workers had worked hard to keep society in the crowning epidemic.
“ It is unacceptable for people to refuse to return to their jobs while workers in factories and warehouses throughout the country have continued to work so that public workers could eat during this period, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to go on vacation but cannot do so because of the people who refuse to go back to their workplace, even if they are safe.
Job force officers cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever – especially now that we know that people can return to work safely."
Following a request from the prime minister last week, Alex Chisholm, the newly appointed head of the public service, announced that the service would “turn away from employees in the public service working at home, and speed up their return to their workplaces until August 1. ”
The civil society of public and public workers expressed the need not to comply with this requirement, and they asked about politics.
A representative of a civil society of public and public workers, the largest civil society of civil servants in Britain, said that the requirement to return to work was “not established with the health and safety of our societies in advance or to strengthen the economy.
This is based on political pressure from the members of the party that demand that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to the social partners is clear: If you are doing your job at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, do not, of course, take it."
The issue can be caused by increasing dissatisfaction with the late version of passports because of staff working at home, but some 400,000 people are now told to wait for their applications to be processed.
The Ministry of the Interior has now published that it will “seek to speed up” applications from the British for travel over the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a visa for more than four weeks.
The public and public employees’ unions have admitted that some had to wait up to 143 days for passports, but they argue that “small and often narrow offices” make it difficult for the 4000 personnel of the passport service to keep the necessary distance.
The former government minister, David Davis, urged the leaders of unions to ‘ act wisely ’ and seek ways of working with governments to get people back into their workplaces.
He added that if he were in government, he would ask a labor officer: “What is it you want, that people stay home all summer? ”
Similarly, several of Britain’s largest companies have ignored Johnson’s recommendation to return to work.
A study in larger workplaces with a total of 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
The emphasis on history can play an important part in peace
The hand has expanded, but understanding and sweetness should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by an Australian story.
The fact is, without radical action, the only subject that deals specifically with our history — “Saga Australia” for the 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even before.
Last year, only 628 students in Victoria completed a study in the history of Australia of a total of 49,324 graduates who completed primary school, or just 1%.
Over the past six years, this figure has almost decreased by half, but nearly 100 fewer students report their participation in the subject every year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about the history of Australia in the 12th grade is that there has been little work done in previous years to interest them.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the broader “thinking. ”
Therefore, the 7th and 8th grade students complete only one brief unit about “the natives and islanders on Torres Bay and their culture. ”
In years 9 and 10, there is another unit for Australia in the world war.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about the history of Australia during the primary school years.
In years 9 and 10, there is another optional unit for the period 1750-1918.
It is urgent to take three steps to save an Australian story in Victorian schools.
First, a story must become an independent subject, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is taught only as part of science, it has little room for study.
It is usually taught by people who have general education in the field of science but who have not studied history.
Histological skills, such as the analysis of information, are complex.
We must hire more specialized historians to ensure that such skills are taught in a accessible and exciting way.
Third, from 1788 to 1914, Australia’s history must become an obligation.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in the 12th year of study, as they would have had to learn the material from scratch.
A knowledge of history alone does not make a deep gap between races.
But without it, as can be seen clearly in the book of Victoria, the project is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is a Congressman of the liberals at the Congress of Victoria and former assistant director Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.
Aaron Elis in the playoffs of the European site - Isaki split by field in half
Aaron Elís Hørndarson has come to a final play on the European seat in the Danish Selection Department of Football.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only his first half with Norrköping’s top team against Falkenberg, Sweden.
Aaron Elis was in OB’s team in Denmark when the team continued to play a final game of seats in the European Union’s predestination.
The OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final play, but this will depend on whether the team ends up after the final tour of the top part of the Danish Selection Department later today.
Aaron Elis played the whole game in 1–1 equal to Horsens on the field today, while OB had won the first game of the team at home, 3–1, thus winning a total of 4–2.
Isaac was in Norrköping’s opening team, which was unexpectedly 2–0 below after the first half of the game against Falkenberg bottom team in the Swedish Selection Department.
Norrköping made a threefold division at the beginning of the second half, and Isaac was one of the ones who had to depart.
Norrköping reached an estimate, but Falkenberg reached 3 to 2 in 89 minutes.
However, it was still time for Norrköping to settle hell at the last minute, 3–3.
Norrköping is still on top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö, which is playing for good later today.
Falkenberg was able to get off the bottom for a while, but the team is a step above Helsingborg and Kalmar, who have a good game.
Collecting sources of National Festivals in Crown Virus Times
Anna Lilja Sigurdsdóttir set up the Facebook group “My People’s Party 2020” to gather documents about the festival that the Egyptians are going to hold next weekend.
Many people plan to lie down in their own ways and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja talked to Hjuta in the Helgins program at the Björðinn.
“ There’s nothing in there yet that’s very exciting, too, because there’s 600 people in the group so that people are clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilja.
There's something about the island's going to have tents at home in the garden.
“ People have talked about having their own [fest], perhaps tenting in the garden, and coughing up the family as they always do at this time, ” says Anna.
“ You expect people to spend time with their people.
However, it is likely that many people will simply not be there “but to observe some small festival somewhere else. ”
The National Assembly Committee is now working hard to repay the tickets purchased, but Anna believes that many locals are more likely to secure tickets for the next year.
“They are even investing in the tickets now and being valid for 2021.”
“I’m a great nationalist, I love the preparation and everything around this, but sometimes something comes into life that you don’t control the road, and that’s just how it is, ” says Anna, “but it’s said that people have something to do with asking if the Egyptians can’t let go of a national festival “that once. ”
Anna Lilja says that she has not set up the group for herself or to encourage people to hold their own national festivals but to gather documents about the weekends in the Islands that year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in one or the other, but there's some people who use such sources in something, but I was just creating some area where people can put in what they're doing."
At the same time, a burn has been uploaded on a four - year - old satellite set on fire.
“ I think many people are excited to have a burn on Friday night.
The only thing that, of course, makes a line in the account is that the prediction is no spew."
“ It will be lit in this fire, but it just has to show how it will be, ” says Anna Lilja.
You can listen to the interview with Anna Lilju as a whole in the player below.
Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in a new dossier on sexual immorality?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in court documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
The U.S. Judge has ordered that secret documents on Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Among these 80 pages of documents are parts of Maxwell’s 2016 testimony.
The display of these pages could also put great pressure on Prince Andrés, in which they can find communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, the alleged sexual slave of the disgraceful American financial man, claimed in 2015 in court documents that she had been forced to engage in a conversation with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrew is now preparing to defend himself from the possible publication of information this week with even more harmful accusations about his friendship with the Baranist Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged vitalist, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The U.S. district judge Loretta Preske made an order this week for the publication of 80 secret legal documents related to Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of pages.
The display of these enormously extensive documents would be a shock to the 58 - year - old Maxwell, where they have a large share of her testimony to lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “affecting questions” about her sexual history.
They could also put a great deal of pressure on Prince Andrew, since one of the documents contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, alleged the sexual slave of the disgraced American financeman, claimed in 2015 in court documents that she had three times been forced to engage with Andrew.
Andrew has repeatedly rejected these claims.
A 2015 email that has been leaked and the BBC published last year seems to indicate that Andrew asked Maxwell for help in responding to Robert’s claims.
We have no doubt that the duke will be upset
There he told the high - class woman: “Let me know when we can talk. I have certain questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied: “I have information, and I need you to call me when you have a free moment. ”
Last night, a source close to Andrew said: “The Lord of Jorvík has done nothing wrong, so we are not concerned about the opening of court records.
As the courts of the United States have tried to point out, this does not mean that, although it appears in court documents, an accusation is true.
The U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take full care in handling the charges contained in legal documents.
We totally agree with that.
We have no doubt that the duke will have full rebellion in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in custody at a Manhattan detention center and is waiting for court to find and seduce some of Epstein’s victims who were under the age of 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of perjury for denying knowledge about his misuse.
She rejects all the charges.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s criminal proceedings, now under the surname Giuffre, which she took up after marriage.
Some 40 pages of a total of 418 with that testimony were made public last year, but after the decision of the judge Presna in New York last week, several parts could be opened first on Thursday.
Lawyers Maxwell had one week to appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York last year when he waited for sexual abuse.
Detectives are looking for a gang of criminals after violent attacks on the streets of Edinborg
Three attacked a man in the city of Eden, and they suffered a lasting injury.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked in Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the Royal Hospital with serious injuries.
The investigator Dale Miles, who directs the study, said: “It was a violent and impulsive attack. ”
The suspects fled towards Newtoft Street.
One of them was considered to be in his 40 ’ s, about 18 inches [180 cm] high and highly grown.
He was short - cut and dark - haired in a white body, dark trousers, and dark shoes.
Detective Miles said: “I pray to everyone in this area at the time of the attack and saw something suspicious to report. ”
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, ambassador of the United States of America in Iceland, wants to carry a gun on this country and wants to increase security.
He is said to have been “sick ” about his safety since he arrived in the country last year.
This is stated in CBS’s report, which also says that this is what Gunter wants, despite his working in “one of the safest kingdoms of the world. ”
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. State Department to hide from the Icelandic government that he may carry a gun.
Then he has asked for a armored car and vest that protects him from a knife tongue.
The CBS sources, however, have repeatedly informed Gunter that he is not at risk in Iceland.
The CBS report states that Iceland’s State Department has not provided information on whether a request has been made from the United States for the possible weapons birth of Gunter, because the authorities do not express themselves about security measures taken by foreign agents.
The news office’s sources, however, say that no request has been made.
In that case, CBS has also since his sources said that Gunter was told that he should not seek to carry weapons, for it would be taken as an insult in this land.
Gunter has been a dermatologist in California for some years.
He's active in the U.S. Republic Party and President Donald Trump's impaled supporter.
He recently drew attention to this land when he was begging for “the invisible Chinese viruses. ”
CBS’s sources also say that Gunter was seriously downgraded by the U.S. Council of Ambassadors in Reykjavík.
He already had seven other members of the Council of Ambassadors from May of last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to “The Deep Kingdom, ” which is to be the network of American officials working against Trump, and he responded to the fact that one carried snow into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February before the conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS’s sources.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but eventually Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, had to order him to return and did so in May.
The home-game form is a key to Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has a easier chance when fans are allowed to return to play
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hots question has not lost a game at home since the beginning of the selection department, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain a good pace at home if the audience were allowed to play.
Asks has won 12 wins at home during this season, but lost four times — only one of the six pieces that are above them has lost more at home.
The coach portugalski said that while such a career was possible without the adherents, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
“We have to do this with the fans, and without them we can build some kind of fortress, where the game plan is in the foreground,” he said.
“ But I believe that it is much more powerful to do so with the fans, because then the emotional sides of the game, which only comes with the help of the fans in the home stadium, are added. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger rivals it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the long periods of victory at home that he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up for the last three seasons.
But this is also a key factor in determining whether the team achieves its goals at the end of the period, especially in equal games and neighboring laws, where the atmosphere of the field can change.
“ I believe that the policy of the Selection Department is that it is now more and more difficult to beat this unspoken record, because of the good things that have happened. ”
“ On the other hand, it is important to be strong at home and, at the end of the season, have brought in many ladders with victories in home games. ”
“ I am happy with the final results of home games recently, without the fans, but we need them back.
I imagine victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
It's sympathy that's built up gradually."
Buyers excited for life styles in Lovely Banks
“Better is better” is clearly the opposite of new owners of huge real estate in the neighborhood of Lovely Banks, recently sold at $1,270 in Australian.
Interesting buyers looking for a life style near the center of Geelong flew to inspect this 1.35 ha of land, where there can be a garage for 14 cars, a swimming pool and a view of the Corio River.
Joe Grgic, a real estate manager in Harcourts, North Geelong, said that the offer to the property that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of being placed on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back for sale
Home to use for isolation
“ We received many offers from various parties, ” said Grgic.
“ The property is sold to a homeman who is very excited. ”
The property comes with four rooms on two floors, including a special bathroom that is large enough to accommodate a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three living quarters and can use the kitchen and upgrade the outdoor area with a view of the swimming pool.
“ It was in the composition of the property, that it was three acres, and that it was in this place, ” said Grgic.
“ Here came interested buyers from Melbourne who wondered what the property was in the middle of the area, but still with a rural blur.
“I have people who have missed and buyers who are still searching. ”
He said that the large storage area, which includes a double garage and a free - standing cover of 10-12 vehicles, was perfect for industrialists or for storing a trailer and a trailer.
Thinks its security threatened in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed as one of the safest countries in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been a friend of his safety since his arrival at Reykjavík last year. ”
This is how CBS News’s detailed discussion of the ambassador of the United States in Iceland begins, but this is an expression of several sources of CBS from U.S. foreign service.
The CBS review claims that Gunter requested that the U.S. State Department provide special permission for Icelandic authorities to carry firearms.
Then he should have asked for a armored car, as well as for ideas about a vest that might protect him from knife attack.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether Gunter’s safety is really threatened in Iceland, but according to information provided by officials, Gunter has repeatedly been told that he is not in any particular danger.
In spite of this, the United States Council recently announced a full - time lifeguard, including in the late morning of July 18, but CBS reports that it is done to delay Gunter’s anxiety.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not express any specific security measures in connection with its mission, but it always sets out the objective of ensuring safety in a preventive manner.
The Ministry does not answer questions regarding Gunter’s request to cease arms and the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not want to say whether the United States has formally requested the ambassador to carry firearms, and it usually says that it does not express itself in foreign office security matters.
The CBS, however, has stated that the request for this material was never made, and according to three U.S. officials Gunter was given these plans, which could lead to an insult to Icelandic residents.
The CBS review also discusses the various difficulties that have been encountered by the US Council in Iceland since Gunter’s appointment as ambassador last year, but he will already have divided his alternates out seven times.
Thus, the first vice president is said to have been preparing for his work for a long time and has learned Icelandic only to have been denied the status at the last moment because Gunter “does not look at him” at their first meeting.
His successors have not been much better under Gunter’s control.
Governments of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs are said to be aware of the position of the Icelandic Council, but they are reluctant to intervene in matters related to the President’s close ties.
In addition, Gunter is reluctant to comply with the various rules of foreign service and respect the order of power.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a conference in Washington, and it is said to have refused to return to Iceland in the wake and have given his temporary place to his work for months, and that in the middle of a pandemic.
Mun Gunter even wanted to do his job in the distance and said that he would not return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically wanted it.
According to information from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take a personal permit until the end of the conference and the crown epidemic has delayed him further, but according to CBS, many members of the Ministry will have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, which he has not done until May, following Pompeo’s contact with him and kindly asked him to return to the Council in Iceland.
The CBS review also reports of Gunter’s enemies in Iceland, especially in connection with a ticking, where he calls the crown viruses “invisible Chinese viruses” and has received great criticism.
Gunter is one of the many, almost inexperienced members of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, which has been appointed during Donald Trump President’s reign.
Sachs Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; Bharatiya Janata Party says government crisis in the state; Congress wants a vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if needed, the Congressman would have to make a protest outside the home of prime minister.
On Saturday, a day after a peaceful protest to Raj Bhawan, Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, prime minister of Rajasthan, said that if needed, Congressmans would have to meet the president and material for a seat-to-face protest outside the home of the prime minister to lead the crisis in the state to a conclusion.
At the Congressman meeting, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to hold a vote to check that the majority of the Congressmans and their troops were in the power struggle.
“ He said the government has a majority, and he wants to take a vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi, the main party defender of the Congress Party, after the meeting.
The Congress conference was held in a hotel where the congressmen who support Gehlot have remained in office during the last days.
“ The prime minister asked us to be prepared to stay at the hotel longer.
If necessary, he said, he would meet the President and also keep peaceful protests outside the home of prime minister," said the party leader.
The prime minister of Rajasthan can summon the Congressman and have the Congressman show the majority of hiss, said the party leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, and indicated that the Bharatiya Janata Party's plan to overthrow Ashok Gehlot's government had been discovered by a chair.
“ The country is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and work with the authority of the people.
Bharatiya Janata’s decision to overthrow Rajasthan’s government has been revealed.
This is an insult to 80 million people in Rajasthan.
The prime minister must summon the assembly to bring the truth before the land," said Gandhi in the silence of Hindus.
Ashok Gehlot, prime minister of Rajasthan, told Congressmen on Saturday that he was ready to attend a meeting with the president of India to ensure that what he calls the “Bharatiya Janata addiction” of delaying a vote of confidence.
Gehlot, who protested for hours at the home of the governor Kalraj Mishra on Friday to press Congress, met with Congressmans and government on Saturday, and after the meeting, new proposals were made and approved by the government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to return to the assembly request and to refer to six objections.
The motion will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying the Congress meeting where he is “under pressure” to delay the vote that determines the trust in his government.
When Gehlot met his government, Bharatiya Janata’s delegation, led by the leader of Satish Poonia, and the leader of the government opposition to Gulf Chandra Kataria, met with the governor to discuss the position of COVID-19 in the state.

Spencer Gramram's playwright gave a ditch outside a restaurant in Manhattan.
NEW YORK – The actress Spencer Grammar said she was trying to calm down a man when he cut her arm and stuck her friend in the back outside of a restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Gramr, 36 years old, told US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation as they had been trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.
Gramer and her 32-year-old friend were sitting at a snowmobile on the Black Ant surface in East Villagetown of Manhattan about 23:30 p.m.
And it came to pass on Friday, when a man went up to them, and demanded that he be paid; and the restaurant was shut down.
Gramer and her friend were injured when they tried to “resolve differences between an unknown man and other visitors at the place, ” according to the police.
The man ran off the place after wounded the right arm of Gramr and stabbed her friend into the cramped back with an unknown odd thing, said the police.
Nobody's been arrested.
Gramer, who speaks for Summer in the "Rick and Morty" and previously played in the "Greek" series at ABC Family, is the daughter of the "Frasier" star Kelsey Gramr and the actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammar said that both her and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a statement to US Weekly, Gramram thanked those who responded to the scene and the staff of the Bellevue Hospital who liked them and mentioned the “incredible struggle” of this staff to the crown virus epidemic.
“ It really touched us to have an opportunity to thank them in person, ” said Gramr.
“ I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic night at UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The fighter Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now named as the next star of the UFC after registering in the history of Fight Island, but he does not say that he is heading to flag his wealth in a presumptuous way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried Colonel Rhys McKee in their fight in a thriving fight in Abou Dabi on Saturday night when he defeated his rival when three minutes and 9 seconds had passed by the first round by having the punched on him in the floor.
The victory recorded Chimaev’s name in the history books of the UFC for the shortest time between victory in the modern history of the race, where only 10 days had passed since he defeated the British John Phillips in a similarly decisive way, then in a medium - term way.
Chimaev, who has a victory ratio of 8-0, received 50,000 U.S. valley bonus for the performance of the evening at McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now called “Khalib 2.0”, which may be said to be an inescapable comparison because of the high probability of the superiority of Chimaev and the UFC Master in light and where he was born in Téténia, which is near home-high Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite recent fame and financial benefits, the translator Chimaev has said that he would not be willing to flag his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his peer in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“I’m not just doing this for me, I’m doing this for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," said Chimaev when asked about Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
Among other things, he has aroused the attention of Conor McGregor and the active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote in the community media that he could “unfortunately” defeat Chimaev by surrender.
It was not a poisoned answer from the fighter, who is named “Borz, ” or“ wolf, ” in his mother tongue, Thai, who said that he would “paint Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who is now staying in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country at 19 years of age, may give little attention to his financial strength, but he is evidently afraid of emphasizing his fighting skills.
“ I can paint anyone...
How many fighters are in the Velcritar?
I can beat them all," he said.
“ Give me 77 kilos of master, 84 kilos of master, I beat them both on the same day. ”
Israel continues to protest the reaction of prime minister to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel objected to protests against prime ministers in many parts of the country on Saturday and was the largest protest outside the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they began because critics believe that the government’s neglect should respond to the crown virus epidemic after the initial threat of the virus has been compromised.
Netanyahu’s charges for corruption have even further encouraged the protest.
“Bibbi, go home,” stood on a sign of one Protestant.
The second card reads: “Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Also, hundreds of Protestants gathered outside Netanyahu’s beach house in the prosperous town of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to disperse groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called the rapid and unorganized re-opening of economic life in May, the average number of new cases ran up to 2000 a day.
The economic situation of the country has been affected by the restriction of the virus, and unemployment has increased to nearly 20%.
The Protestants say that the government’s financial assistance was hardly sufficient.
The protest took place in the shadow of the trial against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
The hearings will begin in January.
He is accused of betrayal, confidation, and bribery in a series of scandals.
Hundreds of Protestants meet in the centre of Los Angeles to show harmony with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – About 300 Protestants gathered in the center of Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon to support two months of movement in Portland, Oregon, where attention is focused on federal police after conflict with Protestants.
Similar protests took place in many parts of the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The protests in Los Angeles were organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The group joined the Los Angeles Police headquarters at First Street and Main Street, followed by the Large Town Security Center.
The participants also moved to the Alameda route at 101, but later left it.
Part of the population was seen to break windows in federal buildings in the middle of town, and disfellowshipping was written on federal markings.
At least one individual was arrested in the protests.
50 members of the Eid Festival, and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, say government in Karnataka
The festival of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, takes place on July 31st and August 1st.
The Karnataka government has announced that only 50 may be gathered in musk for prayer for Eid-ul-Azha, and has banned prayer meetings in Eidgah and other places for the crown viral epidemic.
Guests who wish to pray in musk must wear masks and keep away, according to the order of AB Ibrahim, the head of the ministry of minority affairs and Wakf.
The order states that the Hild Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, should be held on July 31st in the province of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodama, while August 1st elsewhere in the state.
The order states that although prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid Festival, such events at Eidgah and other places will be banned because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Prayers, however, will be allowed in musks, provided that no more than 50 are involved.
More than that, the ministry says in the directive.
Prayer meetings must not be held elsewhere, such as meeting halls, social centers, or “Shadi Mahal”, as indicated.
The Karnataka Government allows for the opening of temples, mosques and other prayers to those who would like to pray from June 8, subject to good protection from COVID-19.
The U.S. Ambassador wants an armed bodyguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, ambassador of the United States in Iceland, believes that his life is threatened by foreign countries and wants to carry weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Council repeatedly announced “bodyguard” biopsies in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Bræk’s sources, the main reason why these jobs were announced is that Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes that his life is threatened in Iceland.
A fire has talked to Icelandic and foreign sources who tell the ambassador that he is in great danger, and the reason is that he is Jewish.
The threat is not as obvious, but Light’s commenters said that Islamic terrorists had been mentioned as a threat.
The CBS television station discussed the issue on its website this morning, and according to Washington sources, Gunter is a persecutor, demanding to carry his own weapons, to get a full vest, and armed escort, as well as a bullet - resistant car.
According to CBS’s sources, Gunter has repeatedly been told that there is no threat and that the advertisement after “bodyguard” is only for sleeping Gunter.
According to the sources of Klvík, the post had not been decided by the end of June, but the application deadline expired in February.
According to Light’s sources, a formal mission from the U.S. Council has not been received because of these changes.
No formal request has been made for increased guarding or for permission for lifeguards to walk around the walls of the Council of Ambassadors.
Icelandic law makes it clear that such a law is not permitted unless it has a specific authority from the Governor of the State.
There is no information on any kind of threat.
The recent risk assessment by the Governor of the State is a key factor in terrorism.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence that terrorist or extreme groups work here.
For reasons of permitting the arms of foreign agents on the streets of cities and towns in Iceland, the source of Light does not exist.
Gunter drew considerable attention to this country when he shared the title of President of the United States and called the COVID-19 “China viruses. ”
Then he had the American and Icelandic flag.
A radioman in Seattle who mocked Trump's reaction to protests now says he has to get a gun after the Starbucks café below his apartment was destroyed — NT USA News
Paul Gallant has received a new view of violent protests after mocking the President Donald Trump of the United States in June for saying that the Anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.
All that had to be done was move closer to the student’s home.
“I feel like I have to buy a gun because this is clearly going to continue to happen, ” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that the carnivores had “damaged” the Starbucks café on the bottom floor of his apartment building.
“ It’s enough, and it looks like a street party down the street from me, and it’s very angry now. ”
The situation was very different when Trump complained last month that Seattle’s mayor was allowing violent Protestants to take over the city.
“ These liberal Democrats are insolent, ” said the president.
“ The hypocrites burn and rob our cities, and they think it’s just wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, a co-director of the “Danny & Gallant” group of ESPN in Seattle, replied: “Go there for curiosity last night and see neither burns, robbery, nor death.
Gallant said last night that the police had advised the residents to stay away from his apartment, where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks café.
He published pictures of the damage and said, “Well done, idiots, ” and stated that he had also seen fire a few blocks away.
"I don't know what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out."
The twist did not pass people who mocked Gallant for his previous opinion and mocked messages such as “Just relax on salmon, ” and “Well, maybe Trump was right. ”
Jason Rantz, another radioman in Seattle, said, “We won’t finally go on this tour we discussed. ”
Gallant walked by the joke: “Awake and seeing that a lot of people were crying out to me, and I laughed. ”
He said he was standing up for his previous statement, where he had gone through the Anarchist CHAZ auto-control area and although it was not as bad as it would have been out of hand.
“ So it was a fire and a robbery after all, ” he said.
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, in an apartment search with his 28-year-old lover Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the venue of the White Lines, which deals with sighs and swallows in Ibiza, but in the search for housing for the past week, their appeal was second and quieter, away from the party’s pleasure.
The couple who play siblings in the Netflix season were seen looking at a magnificent farm in Oxfordshire, which is for sale at £1.2 million.
They arrived in the area of the Range Rover, which Laura, 34, drove, wearing jeans and white shirts, and there met a real estate worker who led them on a tour of the five - room house.
In the last fall of White Lines, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who knows the darker side of Ibiza when she investigates the murder of her brother, the album-like Alex, who is played by Tom, 28 years old.
Their relationship up until this month, within a year of the end of the six - year marriage of Laura and Sam Claflin, is known from the Hunger Games movies.
Together, the four - year - old Pip and the daughter Margot, who are two years old, are the four - year - olds.
When they announced the divorce last August, Claflin, 34, on Instagram, wrote: “I Laura has decided to understand legal divorce, and we understand in love, friendship, and deep respect for each other, and will continue our cooperation on the training of our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in an audition, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, described their wedding in 2013 as “unquestionably one of the greatest achievements of my life.”
Before Laura got her role in White Lines, she had played in the first Inbetweeners movie, and in the crime drama The Capture from the BBC, which was shown last year, where she played the lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom took a role in the second Inbetweeners movie and in the British series from Sky.
Counting too early to claim another wave here on the land
An expert on the field of disease in the land doctor’s office said that it was too early to claim another wave of the epidemic.
Three new inland infections were detected in the National Antiquology Department yesterday, and tens have come to an emergency.
Two domestic infections were detected on Thursday, one for a man in his 30 ’ s, and the other for a man in his 20 ’ s.
Then no infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, three additional domestic infections were detected, one of which had been at the Rey Cup football convention in Laugurdal.
In a conversation with a news office, John K. Jonsson, a government police officer, said that less had to be shown because of that infection than originally thought.
The second infection occurs in a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15.
At that time, rules on the so - called return portal had been valid.
Kamilla Ruth Sigfusdóttir, an expert in the field of disease protection at the National Competent Authority, says that the person did, however, follow the old process.
His vision was negative when he came to the land, but he became sick, has been isolated, and has been put into sickness by six.
They are all on the way to vision, but two of them are showing symptoms.
The third infection is then associated with the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and who has been infected with the disease.
It has been found that there is a new variant of the crown virus that has not been detected in this country.
“ We don’t know exactly where this type of virus comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
He who is believed to have carried the virus to the land had been in Israel, but also in other European countries."
It is too early to claim that the so - called second wave of epidemics has begun in this country, just as other countries in Europe are afraid.
“ While the majority still operate, it is not eating that it is.
But we're on our toes, and we're watching, thinking about ways to fail if something like that could start."
Megan Fox expresses himself about the relationship
Megan Fox says he found his twin soul in Machine Gun Kelly's rapper.
“ As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I am interested in constellations and I knew immediately that my twin soul was about," says Fox, 34 years old.
“ A double soul is when the soul has come to a level of existence that allows it to divide into two different bodies at the same time, ” said Fox.
“ So we are two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ When we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I taught him about the constellations and asked him about his life.
I decided to go to the depths immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly takes the same line, but they met on film.
“ I had begun to hang outside her trailer and hoped to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Only two months have passed since Fox left his husband to ten years of age, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim
The American musician, the Tiskukol, and presidential candidate Kanye West have apologized to Kim Kardashian West because of his speech that he had the family’s private affairs publicly dropped.
“I would like to apologize to my wife Kim for having discussed private matters publicly,” he wrote on Twitter last night.
The situation of their relationship has been a great problem, but Kanye has recently spent a great deal of time in community media and at a mass meeting he held on the last Monday, he discussed the birth of his daughter, North West, and said that he almost killed her.
Then Kim stepped forward on Wednesday and published a message to her followers on Instagram, where she discussed her husband’s illness, which is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously expressed himself publicly about her husband’s illness, and he says that this is because of her husband’s children and has given Kanye the right to privacy when he or she comes to his health.

Increased weight in protests against racial rights in the United States
Protestants have walked through many cities in the United States to draw attention to racial rights.
Objections have lasted for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd died in a police station in Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent federal police officers to Portland, and so it is still subject to the protest.
Protestants now also object to the presence of the federal policemen in the city.
In Seattle, on Saturday, after a protest meeting in support of the protests in Portland, the police used bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people.
According to police, more than 20 police officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was released into Black Lives Matter's claim.
The media’s sources say that man may have gone up to an armed rifle before he was shot.
“ The point is that it is terrible that someone should die in protests, ” said Steve Adler, Mayor Austin.
Adler claimed to be “harm beat and speechless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with permission to enter without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor’s boyfriend had first shot to the policemen, for he thought they were burglars.
One policeman has been fired for Taylor's death, but the other policemen have not been brought to justice.
The preface of the NFAC group, the armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in a police investigation in Taylor's murder.
According to police information, three members of the NFAC were injured on Saturday when a weapon was accidentally shot by the rebel army.
Possible group infection with termination
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside of the border.
Two of them were diagnosed with a previously unseen variant of the virus, and it appears that the origin of three out of five infections is completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected by a tourist who has left the country or by an asymptomatic Icelandic, who has probably infected much more.
The surgeon’s localist says that a possible group infection may be sealant in one of the infections.
Two were identified with Covid-19 on the country last Thursday, with each type of virus.
The origin of the infection is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by one of those detected on Thursday, the other came to the country on July 15, and was likely to be infected outside, but the third one is also infected with vague origins.
After sequencing in Icelandic genetics, it was found that the two subjects diagnosed with the virus associated with its new variants that have not been detected in the previous country.
Commilla Joseph’s daughter, a specialist in the field of disease protection at the Land doctor and the replacement of a disease protection doctor, says that Icelandic genetic analysis is now examining the most likely origin of this type of virus.
“ The other case was a similar virus that has been in operation in Switzerland, but not exactly the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it better and lead the odds of which part of the infection comes from," she says.
“ It seems, however, to be on this side of the Atlantic. ”
Thus, the infection is unrelated to the two who came up at the beginning of July and were brought to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has come outside rather than leaping in the country?
“ Yes, it’s different from what has been found here before that there’s really no chance that this was something to paint here, ” answers Kamilla.
“ These individuals are likely to have somehow come into contact with a person who has just come from outside without knowing it himself. ”
The question she asks says that there is still no evidence of where this new virus might have come from.
“ It could be a traveler who has left the country again, but it could also be someone who does not get symptoms and who does not realize that he has been infected, and then naturally there could be more infections.
We'll be on our toes the next few days to watch out for it."
“ To date, there is nothing that is a smart group infection.
But there are subjects who went into a disease in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have already taken samples," Kamilla continues.
“ We haven’t got the results from them yet.
So it could possibly be a group infection during termination."
Is it expected that there will be a social attack now?
“ That is not impossible.
It has not been recently, but it is not excluded because we do not know who has carried this infection in these individuals, which was detected on Tuesday and yesterday."
Would it be possible to talk about a new wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
But we naturally need to be very alert, and we need to keep this in mind even if there is such a limit to how much we can take in people’s visions.
We don't take samples from asymptomatic people, but since we're getting infections that seem to be irreparable, we need to be given a little more looser hands by taking samples from people with symptoms," she says.
In this way, it is expected that the National Anti-Virologic and Anti-Virology Department will give in the visions in the next few days to try to map the situation better in the country.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase vision of domestic territory and provide screening at the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there must be some basis for taking a sample in individuals who are not in the screening activities; the person must be in a condition and show symptoms or have had symptoms and suspects that he or she has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It notes that the infections that were detected yesterday are still in progress and that there is now much work to be done to obtain information about the travels of individuals.
It says that the origin of domestic infections seems to be irreconcilable, but it does not rule out that some of those who have now been infected can provide evidence that eventually leads to the original infection.
The restaurant that most people know about, but if one of them is the best
Not all of us have to find out where the restaurant Bjargarsteinn is located and probably has more fans in foreign countries than in this country if the comment on TripAdvisor and other pages is marked.
It has been heard of people who have flown to the land to visit him no wonder.
Berglind Höbsdóttir, food bloggers and cookbookwriters, fell on Bjargarstein during the day, and water was kept in love
“ I don’t know where to start, because the restaurant Bjargarsteinn on Grundstäjður is a wonderful place.
The story of the house is one of the most beautiful things I know, the food up to ten, don't look at the worse end and wonderfully fun servants," says Berglind.
“ The man, the owner of Bjargarstein, enchanted each beast’s right to his feet before us.
My wife and I sat with our girls all night to eat, so it must be said how good the food was," Berglind adds.
“ The house where the restaurant is run is an old apartment, which was moved whole on the Grundsfjörður.
Current owners drove their eyes into this house for sale at Akranesi, found a beautiful sea trail on the Grundstäldur, and brought the dream to fruition.
You can find out more about the history of the house on Bjargarstein's website."
“ The houses and all the surroundings of Bjargarstein are unique.
The congregation has been gathered from all the family, and it certainly puts its brilliance on the house.
On the upper floor is a living room and really a cosy and homely place to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and cooking then do not hide, and it is clear that a great deal of effort is being made to magic out tasty and beautiful restaurants," says Berglind, and when the pictures can be seen, nothing can be lied.

Mick Fleetwood praises Peter Green: “His music will live”
Mick Fleetwood praised Peter Green, a founder of Fleetwood Mac, who died today at the age of 73.
Green was the founder of this historic rock band with former Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Despite the fact that Green left the band in 1970, before reaching its peak with records such as Rumours, Mick has lauded this former band member and assured fans that “his music will live. ”
“ For me and all the former and present members of Fleetwood Mac, it’s to lose Peter Green’s great memory,” said Fleetwood in a conversation with PA.
“Peter was the man who founded the Fleetwood Mac band with me, John McVie and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined the Fleetwood Mac without having deep respect for Peter Green and his abilities, and the fact that the music should shine brightly and be carried by unfavorable passion."
"Peter, I will miss you, but be sure your music will live," added the 73-year-old rock star.
“ I thank you for asking if I wanted to be your drummer for all these years.
We did well, and we did quite a good track of music that so many have enjoyed.
“ God be with you, dear friend... with love and respect, Mick Fleetwood. ”
Green’s death was confirmed in the declaration by the Legal Service Swan Turton: “The family of Peter Green reports with great sorrow that Peter died this weekend, peacefully asleep.
A further statement will be published in the next few days."
Green leaves her daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, who had his ex-wife Jane Samuels.
Green founded Fleetwood Mac with Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, but the band was originally called "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac feeding Jeremy Spencer".
However, after four albums, the singer left the band in 1970.
Fleetwood Mac was to be very praised and popular around the world after more people joined the group, including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on Rumours and Tusk.
Prince Joakim's side is said to be stable
Joakim Danaprins, the younger son of Michelle Thorhild, Queen Danaprin, and Henry’s name Danaprins, are still in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he went into surgery yesterday because of a blood clot in the brain.
The Danish State Radio, DR, reports from the Danian Shepherd that the length of the prince, 51 years old, is uncertain at the hospital, but his feelings are constant.
The DR report states that the effects of the blood clot on the health of the prince are now being investigated.
The doctor Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who deals with health issues for DR, noted that the consequences of blood clots in the brain often do not occur until 24 hours after surgery.
“ It can range from insignificant symptoms to hemorrhaging, memory problems or difficulty in expressing, ” says Geisling.
He says that the prince could wait many months for restitution.
Joakim Danaprins, whose full name is Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian, is also a Count of Monpezat, who stayed in the family vineyard, Château de Cayx, in southern France when he got sick on Friday night.
He was first taken to a hospital in Cahors, a town that is not far from the farm but then moved to the university hospital in Toulouse, where he was undergoing surgery because of a blood clot in the brain.
Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
Double optical snapping enables the extra lens of Pixel 4 to be seen in a three-dimensional dimension, thereby providing a better mood in the background with a facial setting than in the previous Pixel phone, which trusted software to achieve this so-called "bogeh" effect.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google’s mythical photographer Annie Leebovitz was brought up to discuss his experience in photography with Pixel 4 during the last 12 months.
A robotic study is still in the foreground of all aspects of a new Google smart phone, and on this phone, “computer-controlled photography” is new to improve HDR+ setting by combining up to nine different images.
New dual lighting controls offer different brightness and contrast sliders and allow users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on a motor study to offer better automatic whitewashing and improved Night Sight night setting, which is so sensitive that it can capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to the other camera unit, Pixel 4 Soli presents a “rombler flag” on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense motion so that users can release a song, turn off timer, turn a alarm on the bell, or turn off the phone’s sound by waving their hand.
All motion Sense calculations are carried out on the device instead of connected to the Internet and the same applies to improved Google helpers, where the technology crisis is now emphasising reducing response time and improving the privacy of users.
The continued emphasis on Google’s full use of its robotic capabilities has also led to a new voice recording app that translates audio directly without sending data to the Internet.
The app is available only in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadium, a scene in the cloud that will be launched on 19 November in the United States, but will still report a date for Australia.
In addition to a new Pixel phone, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and another generation of Google Pixel Buds hearers.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart-hearing devices that are expected next year are completely wireless and have sound adjustments that listen to the environment and constantly adjust the sound accordingly to make the most of the explanation.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart ear tools are completely wireless and set the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also reported an update of its connected Wi-Fi home legs on the Nest WiFi line with a special bone, along with many foundations that work together to improve wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest vow, doubles its predecessors and adds built-in microphones and speakers to use the Google helper at each base of the home.
It's on sale in Australia on November 5th and costs 399 Australians for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or $549 for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but a new $79 Nest Mini improves the sound quality by doubleing the bass and has received a built-in wall fixture.
All Google video speakers will receive new calling system features for communication between devices in the home as well as the ability to call Nest Mini outside the home using the Google Home app.

A Starfisher “so love throw a bottle of beer to sell” in Devon
According to a charity organization, a fisher threw a bottle of beer into his mouth when he interrupted the fishing line.
The pictures taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay seem to show a man on a rock that throws a part towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the gray seal has been fishing when the barfisher emptied from a bottle and threw it into the animal’s back.
Kenny called it a “fearful and careless behavior. ”
He said he was picking up garbage in this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning, along with other people in the security company Seal Project when he witnessed the attack.
“ The seal tried to get into the fishing line, ” he said.
“ The fisher stretched the beer, emptied the bottle, and threw it into the harness.
“ The bottle landed on the back of the seal and he swam away. ”
A teacher said that “successfully sells strong - built animals ” but that it had simply been doing what was natural to him.
“ By throwing a glass bottle into him, ” he said, “you are stopping him on his hunts.
The Seal Project Society said that this was “not a unique event” and that it had recently received“ many reports of this aggressive behavior. ”
The Facebook entry says that its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the Collection at Hope's Nose on Sunday and that “many examples of antisocial behavior ” had been seen.
Everyone sells is protected by the law of the protection of sales, and people are asked to stay away from them.
A giant from Christian Pole, Laxá, Hides
The first centurion was caught in the Laxá in Hideum the second time today.
There was Arnor Isfjord Gudmundsson’s work.
This morning, he had been brittle in Christian Poland, and she was 89 inches [89 cm].
After lunch, he again had the opportunity to visit a Christian Poland and was thought of a story that he had heard that the slowness would take much after the hoarseness had been caught.
With this in mind, he took Collie Dog King and threw over Christian Pole.
Soon he got a shot and as he himself says.
“ After about five seconds, he cleaned himself up and I realized that it was the meter.
I got a little stressed because I had 11 pounds of time.
Usually I'm caught on fish, but I had this one for forty minutes.
In fact, he was quite comfortable.
I took a few trips up and down the pole, but then I got to strand it, and it was a great feeling.
Put the stick down and jumped on it.
He was measured 102 centimetres, and I doubled him," said a merry hunter in the fishing house Hørndargili in Laxá in Hides in a conversation with Spoke.
Arnor is like no beginner when it comes to hundreds.
It was his eighth.
He had such fish in Bröda, Black Sea, Rásphad, Kvarrá, two in Langadalsá, and one in Eystri Rangá.
According to Arnór, there is a good fishing in Laxá in Hides.
The secret that ends at noon tomorrow comes with 35 salmon, and our man has 18 of them.
We expect a great flood because of Hannah
Hanna, the first hurricane of the Atlantic Ocean this year, landed in Texas, U.S.A.
Hannah quickly lost power and became stormy, but in spite of that, there has been a great rain in the area and it is expected that there will be a great deal of floods.
It is expected to rain up to 30 inches [30 cm] in one day, but in special places it could reach up to 46 inches [46 cm], according to the AP news agency.
In particular, it warns of dangerous sudden floods that could occur as a result of rain.
The region where Hannah landed has been hit by large distributions of the new crown virus there.
In addition, lakes have gone ashore and caused damage.
There are now at least 43,700 people without electricity and there are numerous relief stations in the area.
Donald Trump, president of the U.S.A., disciplined the hurricane last night and said that it was important that people listen to experts and follow instructions.
Below you can see a picture that was captured by the photographer AP this morning.
Houses burned, shops robbed and internals damaged
More than sixty are dead and sixty more wounded after attack in the village of Masteri in Darfur County in Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in a series of serious security incidents during the last week in which houses were burned, shops and markets were robbed and internalised,” says a declaration from the United Nations Humanitarian Office in Kartum, a capital city that was sent out today.
Abdalla Hamdok, the prime minister of Sudan, has announced that security forces will be sent to the conflict - torn province to “protect the inhabitants and the harvest. ”
Only two days ago, an unknown army in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack.
“ The expansion of violence in different parts of the Darfur region is leading to an increase in overturning, it puts agriculture at risk, and threatens lives and lives, ” says the United Nations.
The conflict in Darfur, in western Sudan, began in 2003 when rebels who are not Arabs rose up against the governor of Kartum.
The forces of government and Arab troops who tried to put down the rebellion have been accused of extensive acts of cruelty, but some 300,000 were killed in the conflict, according to the United Nations’s assessment.
Omas al-Bashir, who was cast by a chair as leader of Sudan, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new Sudanic governments are now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
A TV reporter thanks the viewer for noticing cancerous skin
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A TV reporter in Florida thanks the audience for having noticed her neck nodule and sent her an e - mail that she should have him checked.
Victoria Price, WFLA’s reporter in Tampa, took this advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price told Twitter that she was going to surgery on Monday to have the tumour, the thyroid, and some lymph nodes removed.
“The doctor said it’s spreading, but not too much, and we’re hopeful that this will be my first and last action,” she said.
The viewer sent Price e-mail last month and said that her nod reminded her of the nod she had had.
Price, a 28 - year - old researcher, said this week that the slogan of her TV station was “8 on your side. ”
“ But the role was recently changed when the audience was with MER and I couldn’t be more grateful, ” said Price.

Components of the Jeronimo Open Space complex temporarily closed after two attacks by coyotes – CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by coyotes near the Oso Creek route on the Jeronimo route in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and had to close the route temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees a coyote almost every morning and usually she tries to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came straight to her and bit her in the leg.
The route has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
Mission Viejo City published a report that said: “Today, two different people reported that the coyote had bitten a person. Mission Viejo’s animal welfare service is working on the matter in cooperation with the Department of Fish and Animal Life, and the section of Jeronimo Open Space has been closed. Be careful and be on guard when you are travelling where there is much about wild animals. ”
Wittmer tried to beat off his coyote with a bottle of water.
She called the emergency line to get a ride to her car, but she could drive herself to an emergency.
The coyote disappeared in the hills, but public workers hope to be able to drive and test it for rabies.
Wittmer will be treated for rabies as a precautionary measure for the next two weeks.
She said that this frightening incident would not keep her from the morning runs, but that from now on she would choose another place.
The situation of the other person who was bitten is not clear.
The Protestants of racial hatred meet with the Seattle police.
The conflict in Seattle on Sunday between police and Protestants against racial hatred ended with the arrest of a number of people, but discontents among the public because of the US President Donald Trump’s plans to send a large number of federal policemen into major cities.
Objections against racial hatred and police violence have started after George Floyd’s death, an unarmed black man, in the Minneapolis, May.
The Protestants in Seattle cut off their bicycle - bearing cars and broke windows in wheelchairs on the protests on Saturday, which led to police declaring an outbreak and emptying the streets with pepper sprays and blast bombs.
Protestants also set fire to wheelchairs on a building site for a future juvenile prison.
The police said they arrested 45 people, but 21 policemen would have been injured.
The protest was held in support of the protests in the neighbouring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the light of the fact that the Trump decreed very radical measures by the federal police force, unthankful local authorities, which say the police force is exerting excessive power.
Protestants have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of the state of Texas, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in central town on Saturday night, according to the police.
Along with the protests, Trump is increasingly fighting for re-election in November, and has adopted tough law - enforcement policies.
