Greedy stewards are concerned about ‘ looking like a fool ’
Some stewards have suggested that their title be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The concern has come about because of a plan to change the Council’s name to the German Parliament.
All - party stewards are concerned that this could make them laugh.
One laborer’s steward said that his group was worried because “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers living outside Wales: in English, twp means stupid, and pwp means faeces.
A steward from the Plaid Cymru class said that the group in general was “unsatisfied ” and made other suggestions.
A well - known gymnastist said that his group had “open mind” about the change in name, but pointed out that there was not much difference between the words MWP and Muppet (flón).
In this context, it can be noted that the Velcian letter w is presented as in Icelandic.
The advice that is now working on a legal bill to submit the changes in names said: “The decision on all the names of the members of the council will, of course, lie with the members themselves. ”
The Law on the Government of Wales Act (2017) empowered the National Council to change its name.
In June, the Council published public polls, which showed great support for calling the council a well - known parliament.
With regard to the title of councillors, the WMP (Welsh Parliament Members) elected the council, while MWP received the most support from the public in the polls.
According to reports, stewards are now making other suggestions, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement with the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, who is to submit a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The bill on the reform will also include other changes in the way the Council works, including rules on the disfellowshipping of Councils and the committee system.
Councilors will be able to give final vote on their title when the debate on the bill begins.
The Macedonians vote in the elections on land name change
The voters will vote on Sunday to change their country’s name in the “Norwegian Republic of Macedonia. ”
This case was submitted to a vote in an attempt to resolve a decade - long conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province by the name Macedonia.
Athenian city has long claimed that the name of their neighbours in the north is equivalent to the requirements of its land area and has repeatedly protested their applications for EU and NATO membership.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change of name, has said that he will not regard the elections as valid.
However, supporters of the votes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the change of name is simply a price that needs to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bell is a difficult church in Harlem
“ The older people I have talked to said that before, there was a bar and church on every corner of the street, ” said Mr. Adams.
“ Today there is neither one found there. ”
He said it would be understandable for the tables to be reduced.
“ People have other ways to get together today, ” he said.
“Children are no longer the centers of the neighborhood where people meet regularly. ”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money that is raised from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect “and sooner or later they will return to their starting row. ”
He added that possible churches were replaced by residential homes full of people who would not help save the remaining local refuges.
“ The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings become white, ” he said, “and will therefore speed up the permanent closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these camps will be members of these churches. ”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin’s church decades later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930 ’ s.
The local congregation of blacks took over the building.
The Society of the Blacks took over St. Martin’s Church under the direction of Father John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative in evading traders on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who wanted to hire black workers or give them a higher position.
The building was seriously damaged by fire in 1939, but Father Johnson’s congregation members made plans to rebuild it and also made the clockwork.
Father David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson, proudly called the clock game “the clocks of the poor people. ”
The expert who played the clock game in July called it a different name: “Economic Fund” and“ A unique historical instrument. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first clock game in the world that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played, but he moved to a larger clock game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had no one else in his place.
Over the past few months, many architects and workers have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders, and others by the bishops.
The Church Council, which oversees the campaign and is appointed church leaders, wrote the Episcopal Empire in July and expressed its concern that the Episcopal Empire “will seek to bring the cost to the Church Council, even if it had not contributed to the recruitment of the architects and the workers sent by the Episcopal Empire.
Some attenders complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
A shark hurts a 13-year-old boy who dived after a lobster in California
According to the authorities, a shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy and injured him on Saturday when the boy was choking for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack took place just before 7: 00 a.m. near the Beacon Beach Coast of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then wandering over with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had at first thought that this was only tense about getting lobster, but then “he realized that the boy cried out,“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“ I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: “There is a shark in the water! ” Hammel added.
The boy was taken by a helicopter to the Rady Child Hospital in San Diego, where he was seriously injured.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
At a press conference, Larry Giles, director of the Coast Guards, said that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach Beach in Casablad to the Swam’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and safety purposes.
Giles said that over 135 different kinds of sharks were in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to take a turn in Britain’s cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s plans to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenham’s with cosmetic shelves in a shopping center style and with specialized assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter the UK cosmetic market, which is £2.8 billion worth and continues to grow while sales in fashion and household products are decreasing.
The investment in cosmetics is part of the way to a large market to use a hiccup, which was previously new to the skycasts, microwaves, and household warnings.
Sainsbury’s claims that they are planning to double their product choice for up to 3000 commodities, including trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L‘Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store also intends to re-start sales on its Boutique New Product Selection so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, while younger consumers demand it to an ever greater extent.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume store will test product positions in two Sainsbury stores, the first opened in Croydon in South London last week and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet commerce and an increased tendency for consumers to buy a small amount of food every day in local shops mean that large markets need to work more to get people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury’s, said that the shops would look like malls to an ever greater extent when the store chain tries to fight the low-cost shops Aldi and Lidl with more service and other products than food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos camp in hundreds of shops and has also introduced the history of a number of Habitat camp since two years ago.
The first attempt by the store to revitalize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed successfully.
Sainsbury’s tried to cooperate with Boots around the year 2000, which ended because of a conflict about how to share the income from sales of drugs in the supermarket.
The new policy follows that Sainsbury’s sales to Celesio, Celesio, the owner of Lloyd’s pharmaceuticals, at £125 million three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding to four shops a wide selection of luxury skin brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing manager of Sainsbury, said: “We have completely distorted the appearance of our cosmetic shelf to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specific training for staff who will be within the reach of advice.
Our choice of suppliers is designed to meet all needs. A healthful environment and comfortable location make us an exciting cosmetic store that transforms old trading habits."
Peter Jones, after Holly Willoughby cancels his 11 million pound contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became “rewarder” after the television viewer Holly Willoughby terminated a 11 million pound contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home product and accompanying brand, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, the brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37 years old, reported his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ It, with a painful end by ceasing to participate in popular lifestyles in the latter hour to focus on new and profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones has been “the commodity” at a difficult third - day meeting in the headquarters of his business power in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the TV lady popular admitted it did not have enough time for Truly’s domestic and secondary brand for the new contracts worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been likened to Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow brand, and was designed to double Willoughby’s property, whose estimated value is 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, reported on Instagram that she was about to withdraw from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to stay in one of her many summer homes.
One source reported: “Truly was a longtime leader on Holly’s list of priorities.
This was to be her future project that would gain her income for the next two decades.
Her decision to stop came all to a complete surprise.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so short of the line going to market.
There's a bunch of items in Marlow's headquarters ready to go to the store."
Experts believe that the elimination of this morning’s introduction, which is among the most popular stars in Britain, can cost the company millions because of a large amount of handcuffs, ranging from powders and candles to clothing and household goods, and possibly result in further delays in the sale of the product line.
This could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, her three children's mother, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends of Jones and Tara Capp, his wife, for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as chairman of the government in March.
The couples spend their summer holidays together and Jones on 40 percent of Baldwin’s company, which produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV factor I'm a Celebrity.
Last night, a source of close Jones said, “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
A difficult discussion “and then we became beloved”
He guessed the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate to President, and for being so positive toward North Korea’s leaders.
Why has President Trump left so much behind?
Said Trump and imitated the voice of a reporter.
"I haven't given up."
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On the other hand, discussions about the disposal of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief ambassador of North Korea, told the international leaders at the General Assembly on Saturday that the north had not received a “appropriate response” from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear disarmament.
Instead, he said that the United States continued to support business prayers in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was all the more positive in his discussion.
"We are very close to North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have yielded positive results — missile testing would have stopped, hostages would have been released, and an earthly remnant of U.S. soldiers were returned home.
He also warned against his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
“ It’s so easy to act like president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there, ” said Trump, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage to the island, hundreds of them have perished
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, international relief organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to flee their homes, an emergency situation was not declared, but it is a pretext that the international community can carry out relief activities there.
“ In many cases, they have unfortunately made it clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organizations, so that this is difficult,” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children’s organization is putting together a team to travel to Pala, it is not certain when foreign relief workers can take up jobs in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, spoke of the country’s disaster facility, said that Indonesian rulers were appreciating the situation in Pala to see if international organizations should help in the relief work.
Given the prevalence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the land is sadly ill prepared to defend itself from the forces of nature.
The flood waves have been built in Aceh, which are rare sights on other shorelines.
It seems that the absence of flood - wave missiles in Pala has still increased the risk of death, even if a warning has been issued.
Even under the best circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia may be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A hospital ship that has been at Lombok’s port to accommodate the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Pala, but it will take at least three days to get to the new scene.
President Joko Widodo made it the main point of his campaign to reshape Indonesia’s debased transport routes and has spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
However, a lack of funding has marked Mr Joko's government, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to deal with persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted more conservative religion.
More than 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes when Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with sweats, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equal to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the Selection Department by challenging in the 89th minute of Saturday’s game at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqi about 30 metres from Chelsea's target at less than 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to shoot to the point of the spring pole.
The ball flew high across the target and toward its right corner.
The ball eventually crossed the Kepa Arrizabalag, which jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as long as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“ I saw Kante come and touch once, and I didn’t think so much about it, but I just took the shot. ”
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
In the process, the Chelsea candidate gave the ball with a heel shot to Mateo Kovacic and then spread from the center to the stadium of Liverpool.
Kovacic made the ball walk fast in the middle.
Then he sent the ball on, and sent in Hazard for a vitite.
Hazard ran off his defensemen and scored the spring horn with a left leg shot past Alisson Becker, the goalman of Liverpool.
Liverpool will meet Naples in the front of the selection department at 15:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meets Videoton, UEFA, at 3:00 p.m., Thursday, London.
The number of deaths increases to 832 after a flood wave in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and the flood wave in Indonesia has increased to 832 as reported by the country’s disaster institute early on Sunday.
At a press conference, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, director of the Agency, said that a number of people had been buried when buildings fell into the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
The city of Pala, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with pitfalls from buildings that had fallen.
Police arresting a 32-year-old suspect of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been started after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44 - year - old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32 - year - old was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have encouraged people in the area to submit if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard something suspicious.
Also, I would like to ask everyone, especially a cab driver, who might have got some picture with his car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our investigation."
The police official has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found in an apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The study continues, and the police say they are working to inform the victim’s closest residents.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but a police officer told him that no one could come into the building or leave it.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
People have now been told that many hours may pass until they are allowed to go back in.
A police officer heard him say that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She repeats: “It’s so terrible. ”
At 14:00 a.m., there were two police cars inside the designated area of the police, and one car just outside.
A number of police officers stood in the marked area and watched the residential buildings.
Anyone who could have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Krypaline anonymously on telephone 0800 555 111 and give up the number 247 from September 30.
The support of the British Congress by Cromwell is the latest monument accused of “rewrite the story”
The statue’s ban would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his superstitious Puritan followers on so many cultural and religious jewels of England.
The Cromwell Society, on the other hand, said that Mr. Crick’s proposal was “fascinating” and“ an attempt to rewrite the story. ”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion about having a statue removed, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Hall would be at the bar.
The spirit of the English Civil War against cultural symbols was not the order or execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the preceding century.
The beautiful statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a goal of the 19th - century spirit and is part of a man’s history, many of whom believe that he still deserves praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is counted by many, perhaps rather late in the 19th century than today, as the guardian of the Congress against foreign pressure, in his case the kingdom.
There is still much historical difference as to whether this description is entirely correct.
However, it is certain that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century have shaped the evolution of our people and that Cromwell is a well - known person representing one side of their struggle.
It is worth favoring and remembering his accomplishments as the Protector of the kingdom."
Pigs attack a Chinese farmer and kill him
Swine attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on a market in southwestern China, according to local news.
According to news from South China Morning Post on Sunday, the man named only with his last name “Yuan” was found dead with broken arteries and covered with blood near the 50th of the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig in a pig’s statue on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
According to the report, he had traveled with his uncle from the neighboring region of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the uncle found him dead and saw that a door into a nearby pig’s house was open.
He said that inside theft there had been a huge gilt with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a trial confirmed that the 250 kg floor had killed the farmer.
“ My uncle’s feet were bloody and wounded, ” said the uncle, with the last name “Wu, ” to Guiyang Evening News News News.
A camera recording showed Yuan to be on the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not in the possession of Yuan or his uncle.
The market owner told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that no one else could be attacked while the police collected evidence on the scene.
According to news reports, Yuan’s family and the owners of the market have a discussion about the compensation for his death.
There are registered cases of pigs attacking people, although rare.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband at their home in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a well - known farmer put a 300 - kg [300 kg] pig on a tractor until his wife threw the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood taste can arouse aggression in them.
“ They're just playing.
They're curious, they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to show them due respect," he said.
The remnants of the hurricanes of Rose carry great rainfall over the southwest of the United States
As foretold, the concentration of the hurricane Rosa decreases as it crosses the cooler seas on the north coast of Mexico.
On the other hand, Rosa will bring with it a great waste that could cause floods in northern Mexico and southwestern America in the next few days.
Rose became a hurricane of class 1, with wind strength up to 136 km per hour, at 5 o’clock in the morning to the east coast on Sunday, and he was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa will go north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific Ocean is being formed, and it will travel east toward the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will follow up up to 25 cm of rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical run will be mixed with the approaching lowlands, making up a large and wide - fat rainfall over the southwest in the next few days.
Locally 2.5 to 10 cm of rainfall may cause dangerous sudden miles, soil movement, and possible crawling in the desert.
A large tropical rock will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall per hour at some sites, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall in some locations in the southwest, especially in the largest Arizona cell.
There is a potential for rapid shifts with rapidly worsening circumstances due to the distribution of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised against walking into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
A great rain can turn gilts into a dazzling river, and thunderstorms result in a stupor and duststorm.
The area approaching will carry local outages in certain areas at the South California coastline.
There is a potential of more than 1 cm of waste that could cause slight soil and road noise.
This is the first income of the area during the rain season.
A few distributed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall spreads across larger areas late on Monday and Tuesday.
High yields will spread over four states on Tuesday and last Wednesday.
In October all over the United States, major heat changes are expected to occur as the North Coastal region cools down, but the tropical zone remains somewhat warm.
Sometimes this can cause excessive heat fluctuations over short distances.
A good example of a high temperature difference in the middle of the United States was seen on Sunday.
There is almost 7 degree heat difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summer storms will try to build up and re-distribute.
A large part of the Central and Eastern United States is expected to have the warm start of October at temperatures of about 25 degrees or more from the plains of the south to the north-east.
Fever could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, about 6 degrees [6 ° C] higher than the average.
Our long - term forecast indicates that the average temperature of the eastern United States during the first part of the October month is high.
Over 20 million people watched hearings over Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge, on Tuesday, and the witness of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse that was to take place in the 1990 ’ s, sent out on six different channels.
At the same time, political patrols continued, and television stations interrupted a regular program to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, introduced a bill to enable the FBI to investigate the accusations for one week.
Ford told the elders ’ judicial committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had choked her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in a emotional testimony, said that he was confident that this had not happened.
It is likely that more people watched the trial than the 20.4 million that Nielsen reported having watched on Friday.
The company measured the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television channels.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels that showed the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen is usually in trouble measuring the audience of people in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar to the size of the football finals or the Oscar Prize Festival.
According to Nielsen, most of the polls that took all day looked at Fox News Channel, or 5,69 million, who have been loyally supporting the designation of Kavanaugh.
ABC was second with 3.26 million audiences.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest remained high.
Flake was the center of the game on Friday.
After the office of this congressman of the Republican Party issued a notice that he would prefer Kavanaugh in favour of the host, CNN and CBS received pictures of when Protestants shouted at him on Friday morning, when he tried to go into the elevator to get a meeting of the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while quickly raining over him in a live broadcast at CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right here in front of you. ”
“ Do you think he's telling the truth to the people of the country? ”
People told him: “You have power while so many women are without power. ”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door was closed, he said that he would express himself rather at the committee meeting.
The Kapal and TV stations were all directly broadcast later when the Legal Affairs Committee asked whether to forward Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Senate elections.
Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI examined the charges against the designated person next week, but a minority of Democrats have encouraged it.
Flake was partly convinced by a conversation with his friend, Chris Coons, Senator Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and some other senators.
Flake’s votes changed, since it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has given permission for FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
May, Prime Minister of Britain, accuses critics of being “in political games” for Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Theresa May, prime minister, critics of her plan to leave the European Union to “be in a political game” about the future of Britain and undermine its interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend the Conference of the Iberian Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In a second interview, published next to her interview on the cover page of the magazine, Mrs Johnson, her former Minister for Foreign Affairs, noted that the so-called Chequers program on Brexit and said that the proposal for Britain and the European Union to break each other’s customs would be “extremely scorn”.

Police have arrested one suspect for the death of Wayde Sims in a deadly shooting, 20 - year - old basketball player at LSU.
The 20 - year - old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second - grade murder, according to the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities published a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and said that Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found the genetics of Simpson on them, according to WAFB, CBS’s sister friend.
The police say Simpson admitted to questioning that he shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, a certain guarantee was $350,000.
The court investigator's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, saying that the cause of death is a gunshot in the head and down the neck.
The authorities wanted to thank the special police force in Louisiana, police crime investigation, the Southern University police force, and the local civilians for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of sport at LSU, thanked law enforcement officials for their “expulsion and search for righteousness. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two - foot [2 m] advance grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and took 2.6 instalments for each game during the last season.
Will Wade, a basketball coach named LSU, said on Friday morning that the team had been “harm hit” and“ in shock” because of the death of Wayde.
“ It’s something you worry about all the time, ” Wade said.
Mountains spewed ashes across Mexico City
A box from Mount Popocatepetl has reached south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention (the National Center for Disaster Prevention) advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after an increase in activity and reported 183 cases of gas and ashes release over a 24-hour period.
The center watched the vibrations and tremors from the volcano.
Social media pictures showed a thin layer of ashes in the streets of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Soilists have noticed an increase in activity in the volcano, 72 km southeast of the capital, since the earthquake of 7.1 on Richter was over the middle of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan divorcers just before the anniversary of a self-constraint payment
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent Protestants responded to a criminal police force, and thousands participated in protests on the basis of the first anniversary of the disputed elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned an apocalypse with eggs and threw a powder paint that formed dark dust clouds on the streets, which were usually otherwise filled with tourists.
Later, conflicts also broke out, and police forceed colds to keep the fight in check.
“ We do not forget and forgive ” for a few hours while opposers shouted, “Long live Spain. ”
Fourteen needed attention because of minor injuries they suffered in the protests, according to the local media.
A lot of tension continues in the independent area one year after the October 1 national vote was declared illegal by the Madrid authorities, but was welcomed by the Catalan separationists.
The majority of voters chose independence, but participation was poor, since most of those who opposed separation ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the elections at voting stations in many parts of the region, which resulted in conflict.
A group of independentists had stayed overnight on Friday to prevent protests in support of the police.
The line of protest took place, but it was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, 68 - year - old, participated in protests with his wife, saying that he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ In the past, we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
In spite of having achieved the necessary but short victory in regional elections last December, the independent groups of Catalonia have found it difficult to hold steam this year, since many of the most famous leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention waiting for trial because of their role in organising the vote and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old machine that protested to support the police, said that the politicians of both states had encouraged the conflict.
“The tension is increasing constantly, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned and waiting for trial from late last year, announced that he would invite himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My proposal in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and oppression that we have seen in the Spanish government, ” he said.

Convince score to 1-0 win Livingston against Rangers
The first mark Dolly Menga secured the victory of Livingston
The Livingston team, who came from the lower division, came the Rangers in a blinded position, and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the fortune and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with the Hibernian.
The Gerrard team has not yet worked on the field in the Selection Department this season and is playing against Hearts, who are eight points ahead in the top seat, next Sunday.
For this game, Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna in the European Union on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still unbeated in the division with six victories, and Holt’s main coach has not yet had to experience a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against bitter guests
L. Holts should have been over a long time before it hit a mark, but their bones caused Rangers much trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot past after wandering through the defense to receive a shell consignment from Graig Halkett across the line.
The visitors had Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause problems at the right places.
And that is how the goal was challenged.
The Rangers took advantage of an extra shot, and Livingston worked to create an opportunity for the target. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga in combination, who received a shipment and scored from the middle of the city.
At that point, Rangers had ruled over the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper, did not have to work hard.
So this continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was able to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Allan McGregor, the targetman of Rangers, and Lithgow shot from the mark after a visit from Livingston.
The questions were constantly in the viteig Livingston, but were kicked from, and two demands for the vitae--after the protection of the Halketts against the replacement Glenn Middleton, and one by hand--was turned aside.
Livington Analysis “Glossy”
Alasdair Lamont, reporter BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni stadium
Excellent performance and finals for Livingston.
For a regular man, they stood up wonderfully and continued to overcome all expectations on their way up.
Their style and teamwork have hardly changed anything since they returned to the top division, but Holt deserves great commendation for the fact that the team had been puzzling together since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the captain was very good and led a full-scale defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worralt on his toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s control, they played far below expectations.
They failed to finish their quests and only once managed to open up the field half of the locals, so this should be an alarm for Rangers who are now in the middle of the division.
Erdogan receives a dazzling reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29,), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, they smiled and lighted the sky.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two NATO nations.
There have been disagreements between them on issues such as human rights, media freedom and the entry of Turkey into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new giant musk.
The city is the home of most Turkish people outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from being gathered in front of the musk, but many of her supporters were able to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of them Churdar - also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The two Protestant groups reflect the complexity of this visitor, who is honored as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Conflict in Deptford: A biker died in a collision with a car
A biker died in a collision with a car in London.
The collision was near the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a multiplicity street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. to British time.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics gave attention, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months later, the crash took place after another biker died in a collision where a driver drove away on Childers Street, 1.5 km from the scene of Saturday’s accident.
The police said that she was working on identifying the man and informing his closest audience.
The road has been shut down and road traffic has been directed, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in annoyance
Six jailers were injured when annoyance broke out into a men’s security prison, as reported by a prison police office.
Annoyance broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 p.m. to a British place on Sunday and still gazing.
“Tornado” Special Forces have been called in the area to try to control the riots that eight prisoners are engaged in and are only in one branch of the prison.
The guards received attention due to minor facial injury.
“ Specially trained prison guards have been called out to deal with cases that are ongoing in Long Lartin prison, ” said the president of the prison.
Six employees have been treated for injury.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the officers will be handed over to the police and may have the prospect of spending even more time behind locks and bars."
Over 500 prisoners sit in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the jailer had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October last year, a criminal police force was called at the scene to deal with a serious disturbance in peace, where billions of people were attacked.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with a rapid flow (dry areas could benefit from)
Although it is rare for the tropical region to pass over Arizona, it is likely that it will be early next week when the remnant of the Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest, at the risk of sudden floods.
The country’s weather service has already issued warnings for a sudden month before Monday and Tuesday in west Arizona and south and west Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rosa will go straight across Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with an exit.
On Twitter, the Phoenix Weather Service stated that “only ten fells have reached a level of strength to be classified as tropical storms or lows for less than 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 64 km away from Arizona's border."
Last forecast from the hurricane center of the country predicts 5-10 cm of rainfall, with a single rainfall of up to 15 cm in Moglon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that the rainfall will be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin (the Great Basin), with the possibility of individual rainfall up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of getting into a sudden generation, Rosa’s departure could be a blessing, as there are many droughts in the area.
Although the flood can cause great damage, some of this waste will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, at least 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest group," according to reports from weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rose will land on Baja California shanks in Mexico.
Rose was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm goes across the cooler sea in the Pacific, and its power decreases.
So it is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon on Monday or on Monday night.
There is a potential for high rainfall in some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of floods.
“There’s a shipment up to 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of up to 25 cm of rainfall,” said a report from weather.com.
Rose will then be held north of Mexico as a tropical storm and will reach Arizona’s border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical day, and will then continue up through Arizona to the south of Utah late on Tuesday night.
“ The main risk expected of a rod from Rosa or its remains is a very high rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area of the United States, ” said the Federal Center for the Land.
These offspring are expected to cause life - threatening sudden floods and movements of soils in the deserts, and to crawl at the end of the mountain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four murder arrests
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old man have been arrested suspected of attempted murder, after a 16 - year - old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4 p.m., at a British local time on Saturday.
He was moved to a hospital where his condition is said to be “steady”.
One 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - olds, and one 20 - year - old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to a police officer from Avon and Somerset.
The police have been waiting for witnesses who might have phone records of what happened to them.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “felt the evil and anger ” from the Democratic Party
“The motion for the support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the unmerciful and shameful methods of the Democratic Party,” said Trump of a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “felt the evil and anger ” from the Democrat Party out of his entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to the assembly on Thursday, where he strongly denied the accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed to the Committee his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that “Americans had seen genius and mass and courage” Kavanaughs the other day.
“The motion for confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a magnificent CV as a public employee,” he said to the group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment as he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republican supporters in the mid - term.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't volunteer, but I do, though, really," he said.
“ That’s why I’m going around the world to fight for great candidates. ”
Trump claimed that the Democrats were working “to thwart and hinder. ”
The first key vote on the Board floor on Kavanaugh’s appointment should be held no later than Friday, according to the director of the Republicans in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after earthquakes and floods in Indonesia, and the number of deaths is likely to rise
At least 384 died, and many were swept away when a huge century hit the shores, when a great earthquake and a deluge rode across the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Pala on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] high in the beach at sunset, a lot of people washed out on the sea and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The Deluge was formed by an earthquake of 7.5 points on Richter.
“ When the flood wave was formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t escape immediately, so they died, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spoke of the Indonesia disaster facility at a information meeting in Jakarta.
“ The earthquake didn’t come alone, she pulled cars, a tree-drum, a house, and all that was on the land, ” said Nugroho, adding that the storm had traversed the open sea at a speed of 800 miles [800 km] before it arrived on the beach.
Some climbed up into a tree to escape and survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Pala.
The photos of the air published by the disaster facility showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and ineffective bridges and musks surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to ride over the beach city on Saturday.
The sequence of earthquakes was observed in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The establishment of Indonesia on food and technology stated in a declaration that the hurricane, which was released from the great quake on Friday, would have been about 200 times higher than that of the atom bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow flood, may have increased the size of the flood wave, said the Agency.
Nugroho said that the damage was “real” and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had fallen apart.
A number of victims ’ bodies were found trapped under a crash from a broken building, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death and property damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Pala in a region called Doggila, which is closer to the earthquake.
“ Communication is completely down, and no information is received, ” said Nugroho.
“ Over 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in a declaration, adding that their employees and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“ This has already become a tragedy, but it could be much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The Agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not informing us that a flood had struck Pala, although official representatives said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on the community media, you could hear a person shouting from the upper floor of a building to warn the people on the street below about the approaching flood.
Just minutes later, the floodstorm strikes on the beach and carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the video immediately.
The earthquake and the deluge caused powerlessness that hindered communication with Pala and made it difficult for the authorities to organize relief work.
The army has started sending aircraft with relief from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped from the area still need food and other needs.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for relief operations and will be closed until October.
Mr. Joko Widodo, president of the United States, is going to visit the refugee centers in Pala on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800 after a flood wave in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision workers from Doggila have reached the city of Pala, where they seek refuge in tent cities set up in the park outside their offices. Destruction was struck by them on the way, according to Mr. Dosesba.
“ People said they had seen many houses destroyed, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Helpful groups have started a difficult relief job, but some have complained that foreign relief workers with high expertise would be prevented from traveling to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign finance, supplies and personnel can only begin to come if the accident site is declared a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“ It’s still a local accident site, ” said Aulia Arriani, the spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government has declared that this is a disaster zone, we can open up foreign aid, but no declaration has yet been made."
When the second night fell upon Pala after the earthquake and the Flood on Friday, friends and their families still missing held in the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracle stories that shed hope in the destructive headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a booty.
On Sunday, a fellow worker saved a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body at her side.
Gendon Subandino, coach of the Indonesian flight crew, had been coached by two now missing flight pilots for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were locked in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“ As a man with a long experience on a fly, I have my own emotional burden, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after the news was received within the flight crew because the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed, he would have sent whatsApp a message in despair to the keppends who stayed in Pala and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a grey signal, instead of a blue one.
“ I think that means that the message was not received, ” he said.
The thief steals $26,750 when filling a quick bank in Newport on the Year's Eve
On Friday morning, thieves kidnapped $26,750 from Brink’s employee, who was filling in a speeding bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a news report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying a quick bank in the entertainment area and was about to fill more money on it," said Detective Dennis McCarthy, police officer, of the announcement.
When he was doing his job, another man “came running behind the Brink employee ” and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects flee from the scene, according to the announcement, but police did not give up on how many things were involved.
Those who might have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper turns his name into Ye
The Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name--in Ye.
He reported the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: “The creature previously known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change is due to his participation in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to report his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi on the show, but she quit for “emotional reasons, ” said the producer.
In the past, West has said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a shortening of his present name.
“ I believe that “ye” (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and the Bible means“ you, ” said West earlier in the year when he discussed the name of his album with the radio director Big Boy.
“ So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and over to just Ye--to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former co-workers of West, has also written his name with and without strings and capitals.
The elected president of Mexico, therefore, is promised not to use the military against public citizens.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against public cities, now that the country will soon remember the 50th anniversary of bloodshed to students.
On Saturday in the Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot a peaceful protest campaign in the square, killing up to 300 people at a time when the leftward movement of students was shooting roots across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening up free public colleges.
He has said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities attracted young people to crime.
The United States of America should double funds for artificial intelligence
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funding it has in research in that field, says the inventor and the intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The reports were reported after various branches of the U.S. government issued reports of intelligence, even though the United States has no formal comprehensive programme of intelligence.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be in the first place in the creation of a artificial creation by 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the amount of money spent in intelligence research, compared with the fact that all other countries are so far beyond the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of intelligence, ” said Lee.
A double funding could double the chance of the next major discovery of artificial intelligence being made in the United States, Lee said to CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the head of the company Sinovation Valves, which has invested in Face++, one of the major artificial companies in China.
He worked on a satellite system in the '90s at Carnegie Mellon University, who won the best American player in Othello, and later he was the director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch at Google.
Lee spoke of former technology competitions held by the U.S. authorities, such as the robotics competition, and asked when the next race would be held, to identify the next pioneers.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to gain the strength of the government, Lee said.
“ It’s not China that grabs the most thought, but the companies, ” said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have advised their geniuses from colleges to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration could also help the United States to strengthen their intelligence research.
“I think that those who have a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should be allowed to remain automatically, ” he said.
The Chinese Congress published its future satellite programme in July 2017.
China’s Natural Science Institute provides funds to people who work at universities, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defence set up a satellite center designed to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of special committees on intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF, it invests more than 100 million dollars annually in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, U.S. legislation, which was designed to create a safety board for artificial intelligence, has not continued for many months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country’s name
The people of Macedonia chose a referendum on Sunday about whether to change the country’s name to the ‘Northern Macedonian Republic’ in an attempt to resolve from decades of disagreement with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, whose province is Macedonia, claims that the name of their neighbours in the north is equivalent to the requirements of their jurisdiction and therefore refuses their entry into NATO and the EU.
While the two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, nationalistic opposers argue that the change will undermine the self - image of the majority of Macedonian inhabitants of Slavish origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required for the vote to be valid.
The question of the campaign is, “Do you want to walk in NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece? ”
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a fair price for Macedonia to become a member of alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that it can live freely under the protection of the European Union, for it means a safer life for all of us, ” said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, enough congressmen have said that they will follow it and tie it into law.
The change of name would require consent of the two thirds of the Congress.
The election committee said that nothing unusual had been reported at 1 o’clock after noon.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent of the last referendums in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters paid their vote.
“ I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 - year - old in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko paid his vote in the Macedonian referendum on whether to change the country’s name, which would make its way into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the council in Skopje, Mr. Kavardarkov, 54 years old, worked to prepare a small field and set up chairs in front of tents that had been built by those who will ignore the vote.
“We are pleased with NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with the head loud, not going through the service door,” said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor land, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn into something else like China or Russia and become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that a member of NATO will bring the necessary funds to Macedonia, with over 20 percent of the unemployed.
“I believe that the vast majority of people will agree that more than 80 percent of people are treated by the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after paying his vote.
He said that approval would be “confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonian Institute of Policy showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another television poll showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said yes.
So that the national vote is considered valid, it has to be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious shock to the policy of the Western government since last May.
See: Sergio Aguero, player Manchester City, goes through all the protection Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling went lightly with the defense of Brighton in victory Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his mark in 65 minutes.
At the beginning of the campaign, the Argentinian campaign received a transmission in the middle of the field.
He spread past the three defenders of Brighton and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green - dressed defenders.
He got past a defenseman and then ran away from a few more just as Brighton knew.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English foreman used the first touch within the suite to send the ball back to Aguero, which used his right foot to play at Mathew Ryan, the target Brighton, with a shot at the right side of the target.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” said Pep Guardiola, director of City, to reporters.
“ We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky that he scored a mark at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal of the high school game.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received a long way into Brighton's field half in that quest.
He sent a beautiful long ball left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball a few times and then sent to Sterling towards the remote pole.
In front of City, the ball was sent into the net just before it ran out.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Championship at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhine-Necker stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play prom against Rockies
Since the Nationals have been excluded from the final vote, there was little reason to force a second start.
But the zealous Scherzer hopes to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a chance to get to the finals, but they have one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rockies received at least a wildcard seat with a 5-2 victory at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to reach their first member.
“ Even if we play for free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver as well as the rest of the team will probably play their best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete in such a situation?"
Nationals are still going to report who will be the first thrower in Sunday’s game, but they are thought to have Scherzer throw at these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to play for the 34th time, took a training session on Thursday and would throw on a Sunday, which is usually a Sabbath with him.
The right-handed Washington castle is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 gusts for 220 2/3 rounds during this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the issue of Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge, when he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republican supporters in the mid - term proselytes.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
There are five weeks in one of our most important elections.
It's one of the big, big... I don't volunteer, but do it, because that's why I'm going around the world to fight for great bidders," he said.
Trump went on to say: “You can remember this terrible, radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means you need, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go to get control, they just want power and control, we don't give them that.
He said that the Democrats were working “to hold back and to prevent. ”
“ And it has been seen in the past four days, ” he said, “and the Democrats said that they were angry and wicked and cruel and false. ”
He named the Senator Diana Feinstein, the ruler of the Democrats in the decision - making committee of the Senate, as a name, and was answered with a loud paw from the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who painted the document?
Ha, what.
No, look no, I was waiting for one... it was really bad body expression, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The workers ’ party is no longer a tolerance church.
He does not tolerate those who express their minds
When Momentum of my class chose to accuse me, it was hardly surprising.
After all, I am the last of many Congressmen of the Labour Party who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our mind.
Joan Ryan, my associate, received a similar treatment because she protested harshly against Jewish prejudice.
In my case, the suggestion to challenge me was that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having responsible economic policies, of national security, of Europe, ironically similar issues to those of Jeremy, who disagreed with previous leaders.
The report of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to understand nothing outside and to be effective. ”
During my eight - year career as the Congressman of the Workers’ Party, Friday meetings have often been exactly that.
Sadly, it is not the tone of many today’s meetings, and the promise of “a stronger and better ” policy has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions have not been passed in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged by whether the leaders of the Party consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader when colleagues, whom I thought had previously had similar political opinions as I did, began to expect me to take a complete reversal and supported opinions which I had never previously agreed, whether it was on national security or on the common European market.
Every time I speak publicly - and then little difference is what I say - it follows the creeping abominations of social media where my disfellowshipping is called, the central government is denied, and I said I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, since most of the comments I get are usually political.
I admire the professionality and determination of those who have to endure the horrific sexual or prejudiced insults every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing things in this political period is the natural nature of attacks and insults.
Jeremy Corbyn last week said that the Workers ’ Party should be concerned with a tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a permissive church, and with every distrust or change in policy, the group becomes increasingly narrow.
I have received many counsels in the last two years to be modest, not to be too loud, and then “all right” would be with me.
But I did not decide to participate in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the failure of the government of Thatcher, who left my schoolroom in decline, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether in town control or at council.
I have never assigned my political opinions, nor at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with current leaders.
With those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will damage our homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But my only message, which I want to send from me, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those who are within my ideal, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I serve you proudly and I promise that no threat of deviation or political departure will hide me from doing what I think is for the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeated team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns could have enhanced the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory separated in this soon-paced game of the day in the Tennis's Premiership division.
They are now in the top of the list and one of the ten still undefeated.
Finally, it was their stronger protection and better use of opportunities that made homemen more successful, and Coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be content.
“We have had a tough opposition in our games until now and are still undefeated, so I must be content,” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “Indeed, they took advantage of their opportunities better than we did. ”
Mark Grant Anderson came Ayr over in 14 minutes after Frazier Clemo turned the attendance, but a yellow card on the Scottish leader, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot reached the touchdown.
Climo increased at Ayr’s leadership with a hell before he scored with a kick just before the half and then touched the touch mark and came Ayr over 17-5 in half.
However, after Baggot turned his campaign, Melrose started the second half with power and touched Patrick Anderson’s line of action, reducing the difference to five points.
Then, a long pause was needed to deal with serious injuries from Ruaridh Knott, who had to carry off a playground, and after that Ayr still increased his leadership with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned over.
Blair Macherson, captain of Ayr, then received the yellow card and Melrose used to be a man again with a touch mark from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard quest.
The locals, however, came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for taking Clemo without the ball, MacPherson scored the touch mark behind the Ayr campaign, after an extra shot.
Climo turned the quest back, as he did again immediately after the renewal, after Kyle Rowe reached the kick David Amrstrong from the viteig and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touch mark of the team.
The Star Still Game components are ready for a new career in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game components, seems ready to move to a restaurant crash after finding out he was hired manager of the restaurant company.
Kieran, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC, the popular ones he writes and plays with his old partner from the entertainment business, Creg Hemphyll.
The twin has announced that the future ninth series of factors will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan has plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to official files, he's the manager of A driftmorn Limited.
The actor didn’t want to say anything about the story, but Scottish Sun’s source suggested that Kiernan wanted to become a participant in the “living restaurant business” of Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: the shoreless land of Bolivia hopes that a court will open a way back to the Pacific Ocean
The Seamen are guarding the headquarters of the fleet in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flags.
“ We have a right to the sea, ” says the title, “from Titicaca to Amazon.
It is our duty to restore it."
In many parts of the world, Bolivia’s landlocked monument to the shoreline, lost to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century, still in its fresh memory — along with its desire to sail through the Pacific.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, when Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1st, after five years of long debate.
“ Bolivia has the power, the consensual spirit, and the extravagance, and, of course, awaits the decision with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomate.
Many of Bolivia’s inhabitants will be watching the International Court’s ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will rule Bolivia in favour of the requirement that Chile be obliged to give Bolivia access, after decades of difficult conversation.
The Monday decision is also very important to Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indian lands, who will have a controversial campaign for reelection next year.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised in late August.
However, some commentators are unlikely to think that the Court would rule Bolivia in favor, and that if he did, it would be a small change.
The Court, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to give a land from Sile, has stated that the decision will not affect the conclusion of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the court comes only six months after the hearing indicates that the matter “had not been complicated, ” said Paz Sérate, a Silean expert in international law.
It is also possible that in the past four years there was no advance in Bolivia, but they had led the country back.
“ The current regime of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea, ” said Zárate.
Morale’s military speech has reduced any goodwill from Shile, she thought.
Bolivia and Sile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult after this.
Since 1962, the two nations have not been able to put up with ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia, and representative of the region of The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusual short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Shile, ” and he said,“ to put an end to a conflict lasting 139 years, both countries for the benefit of each other. ”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this topic as a political hedge.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
“ The operation is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past. ”
North Korea says there will be nothing of nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Secretary of North Korea, says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons until it can't trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave his talk at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His statements are now being made by Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be in the process of relaunching talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is “dreaming ” to think that continued business prayers and protests against a declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever knock North Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes clear action first to take down his nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
On the other hand, there is great doubt that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of big hats that will come in the fashion world near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or stay completely hidden from the sun, you don’t have to look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a number of strange hats in excess of the SS19 line in the fashion field that enchanted the jet in the fashion week in Paris.
A number of images of extremely unending hats have been published on Instagram this summer, and these designers have had their latest creations in the fashion visions.
The main work of Valentino was a large brown - light hat with a wide range of borders that looked like feathers and covered the heads of the modelers.
Of other upper-sized components, watermelons were to be set up with gemstones, seismic hats, and even pineapples, but these items are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were composed of composite lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than of high fashion.
One mask resembled a choking device with a pipe of breath and glasses, while others resembled a melting ice in a bread form.
If you want to take a toll in the tithe, you're lucky.
Tactical experts predict that the big hats could soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
Large hats come in the heels of “La Bomba”, a strata with over 60cm of hair that has decorated its head from Rihantanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion mark on the back of the extremely inexhaustible hat that was seen on all social media was inspired by another major feature that appeared in the fashion field — a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the swim - covered model that carried it.
The orange stretcher, with a stringed and white handle from the leather, was the main part of La Riviera SS10’s clothesline Jacquemus at the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, a starist of the famous people, said in an interview with FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags published in fashion stores for the next summer - where the designer has caused such an impact should be difficult to ignore requests for oversized components. ”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding success of their students and have continued in 2018 with new, magnificent test results, which are still supported by individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music and other social sciences.
These schools have up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in their defense, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education, the career they have chosen, and their position as a world citizen.
As a teacher who can put together and teach by specially designed study aids, we see that new languages continue to be popular in school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother's language, it touches his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot just trust in English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest proportions of students who receive tests in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received the A.
The data collected from 74 schools within SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the excellent A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received the A grade.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages that will surely need the skills of children and young people in the future.
At the moment, languages, as an alternative, are placed in the same place as science - related subjects (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) in personal school and elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons that employers gave up, it was 17 percent because there was a shortage of people with language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future work.
Now that more and more jobs are needed in languages, these skills are needed in a global world.
No matter what career people choose, they will have a real advantage in the future if they learn another language, but it is a knowledge that lasts out their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a large person an advantage on the competitive side.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak the other language well enough to maintain conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two-digit percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest immediately in language teaching.
Multiplicity, especially in newly market countries, will give children a better chance of finding a significant job.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies from school to school.
A certain number of schools will focus on classic new issues, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important to Britain when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools commit themselves to offering a study environment, which will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to achieve success, no matter what the future will bring.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, languages will continue to be necessary for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, today’s language should be viewed as “an international knowledge of communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity, and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le fiaire.
John Edwards, chairman of the Scottish National Council of Education
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Coach Laker, has announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
“ It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48, ” Walt said on Laker’s public website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, on Twitter said that James would probably play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked his plans for six Laker’s game schedule before the start of the season.
“ During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare, ” he said.
Timer for the Trump election meeting in West Virginia and YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will hold a lot of election meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his choice of a new Supreme Court judge has been suspended, Trumpet aims to build support for the next mid-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when votes are paid in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch him on the Internet?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is due to begin at 7:00 p.m. to the east coast time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the Internet below through a direct broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will refer the trial to Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge, where tension was caused by the accusations of sexual harassment, and the order of the Senate to confirm him as a judge was suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates the accusations.
But the main objective of the Trump meetings is to help the Republicans get better, but they are waiting for difficult elections in November.
Thus, the message from Trump’s campaign was that these five meetings that will be held next week aim to “fill volunteers and supporters of enthusiasm as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and in Congress, ” according to Reuter’s News Office.
“The government of Congress is so necessary for the president’s plan that he will travel to as many states as possible at the start of the second campaign,” said an unnamed spokesperson from Trump’s campaign at Reuter’s News Office.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and that the media from Pittsburgh tell him,” according to West Virginia Metro News News News.
The meeting on Saturday will be another visit by Trump to West Virginia this month, which won by over 40 percent in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the publisher of the Republicans in West Virginia, to the Senate, who is at the bottom of the polls.
“ It is not good for Morrissey to know that the president has to come and try to increase his popularity, ” said Simon Haeder, a political scholar at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuter’s News Office.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team shows a willingness to keep hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one - side circles, the fourth, which was tomorrow’s afternoon, could be exactly what was needed in this race for Ryder Cup.
Changes in success are sports that have been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in the race like this.
Where would they say success is now?
“They had six points ahead and now it’s four points, so that success lies rather on our side now, I guess,” said Jordan Spieth when he launched the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has its head start, four points ahead, with an additional twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth said, believe that they have a little wind in the sails and they can be hopeful over many, especially the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played a great deal away from the surface and leads by his example.
The good news increased as the ring passed, and he put down an important cushion to provide all four stages of the game after he and Thomas had been two points below after two games.
His putt, which gave them victory in the 15th floor, received a similar shout of joy, a cry of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team still has a victory hope.
“You just have to dive deep and think about your own game,” said Spieth.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to work in a step.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but fascinating European couple has won four games out of four and cannot do anything wrong.
“Molwood” was the only couple who got schooling on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid schooling on Saturday morning, on Friday, and on the nine hole field on Friday morning.
That game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audiences clearly shows that they are the pair that have to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the potential victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, when the sun sits on the Le Golf National Square.
The best option would be for both of them to do so simultaneously on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European people.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the quad in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
A school and two doubles in the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Swiss digged into a hole that they never got to scratch.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The quadruples and the quads are so exciting to watch in the vicinity because of the communication between the pair, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how the game plan can change at one point.
Europe has played better as a team to date and has a considerable lead for the final day, but this quadruple also showed that the American team has the will that some had doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 leadership for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good start for the final day of the Ryder Cup after a quadruple and the fourth of Saturday, with a head start of 10-6 to the United States.
Astrology Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who had difficulties, and have got four points in the Le Golf National field.
The European team Thomas Bjorns, who would like to get back the prize cup, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the American team in the quadruple of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States showed more opposition in the quads and played two games than did it.
Jim Furys needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European freshman to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who shared the nickname “Moliwood” after a wonderful weekend, are only one pair who win four points from their first four games in the history of the Røder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quadruple game, they showed a great teamwork and won Wood’s downpour and U.S. freshman Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius occasionally, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four ball games and four games and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the four-ball game of the morning, came back to his partner, Henrik Stenson of the Fourth, and worked 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in the first and third seats on the list of the best golfers in the world.
However, Europe did not take full advantage of this mild and gustious day southwest of Paris.
A three -fold winner in golf, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They worked with troubles 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in quadruple games and later came back and won Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quads after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has worked up four points a difference at the start of an individual race, although Furys’ team only needed a tie to continue the cup.
However, after two days of second - grade service, they appear to be overwhelmed by a terrorist attack on Sunday.
North Korea says one - sided disarmament “unstable” without trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea said that continued business prayer would only increase their distrust in the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons one-sidedly under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho, in the annual General Assembly of the United States, said that North Korea had taken “substantial measures to show goodwill” over the past year, for example by halting nuclear and missile testing, taking down the nuclear testing area, and promising to risk the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“ On the other hand, we have seen no corresponding reaction from the United States, ” he said.
“ Without trust in the United States, there is no guarantee of our country’s safety, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons one-sidedly first. ”
Although Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about the resistance of Washington to the “staged” approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed special in that he did not deny one-sided nuclear disarmament clean, as Pyongyang had done before.
Referring to the joint statements made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work on the "Korean nuclear disarmament" and Trump made a promise to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a solution to the formal end of the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted allegations to relax a strict ban on trade against North Korea.
“ The United States demands that “nuclear disarmament take place first, ” increasing pressure by using commercial prayer to reach its own goal, even protesting the declaration to end the war, ” said Ri.
“ It is only a dreamy person who knows nothing about us to think that business prayer can get us wrong.
But the problem is that continued business prayer increases our distrust."
Ri didn't mention any plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump that the leader of the United States spoke about earlier this week.
Instead, the minister spoke about three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea for the past five months, adding: “If the party that this nuclear weaponry was South Korea instead of the United States, this position would not be the position in the nuclear disarmament issue on the Korean coast. ”
In spite of this, the tone of his speech was a very different one last year when he told the General Assembly that it would be inevitable to label missiles from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after “the demonic president” Trump called Kim “a fireman” for suicide.
Last year, Trump threatened to “destruction” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much work was still left and that business prayer had to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the Swedish Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
But Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State at the Swedish Security Council on Thursday, said: “The security council’s request must continue until total nuclear disarmament has taken place and it has confirmed. ”
The Security Council agreed to increase business requests to North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to close the funding for nuclear and missile programmes Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the General Assembly of Sweden and said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for making “wrong demands. ”
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to take down the missile area and nuclear power station if the United States resorted to “equal measures. ”
He said that Kim had told him that the “equal actions” he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and actions toward normal relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard take a course at sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an effort to resist the growing tendency of students to watch and learn all night using caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little or nothing when it comes to thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard medical school and expert at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes that it sees its first species in the United States.
He was given the idea of doing the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep failure on learning ability.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked: “Why is this first said to me, in my final year? ”
She said no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
The first - time study this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help to study and perform sports and even contribute to general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of mental health care at Harvard medical school and director of health care school, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were very sleepy over the week.
The study period is an hour long and includes several interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room at home, where students click on a cup of coffee, window tents, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance may get worse by lack of sleep, along with the importance of a good bus before sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long - term lack of sleep may increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive signs encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“ We know that this will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we feel that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that favors those who stay awake and learn all night is still present, he said and added that modern technology and the constant pressure on students meant that sleep failure was a growing problem.
Ensure sufficient sleep of good quality should be “secret weapons” students to protect themselves from stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid fatting, for the lack of sleep increases the brain’s desire for food so that the body’s body is sanitized.
Raymond So, 19 years of age in chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, but he sat one of the professor's cows last year in Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step must be to ask all masters to complete a similar course before they begin their university study.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting the alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them up, and consider the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can confuse the inner clock of the body and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrd's men
Rangers were still in trouble at the field, where Steven Gernard’s split team had to accept 1-0 losses on Livingston, by goal from Dolly Menga.
Team Ibrox wanted his first victory in the field after his victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gernard's only second loss in 18 his games as manager. The team is now eight points behind the Hearts, which is in the top seat of the Ladbrokes Premiership division.
Menga scored seven minutes before half a game, and Ranger’s team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to equalize.
Rangers now fall down to the sixth seat, but Livingston goes up to the third, and is only following the Hibernian in a goalline.
Rangers could have any further trouble after the Liner Calum Spence had to get attention because of head injury after some object was thrown into him from the field half of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that swept Ayr away and came in front of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stuck to the same Life 11, which reached a level of Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased with how well - trained his troops were fighting over the opposition.
Rangers may have had more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball that it reached.
They should have scored only two minutes after the start of the game when the first shipment from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's mark, but he shot past.
A long spare shot from Keaghan Jacobs then ended up at Craig Halkett, while his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, shot past the far pole.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live in hope rather than faith in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have been given a hell when a quarter had passed the game, when he and Steven Lawless put together, but Judge Steven Thomson referred to the Colombian’s appeal.
Rangers only took two shots to the first half, but Liam Kelly, a former Ibrox target, did not have to have much to do with defending shells from Lassana Couulibaly and easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although an opportunity from Livi in 34 minutes had come even though the other team had the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, but only because of their perseverance.
Rangers failed again to do anything out of Jacob's long spare shot.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his peace and chose to send to Menga, who then scored easily.
Gerrard took half the board and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly, and the exchange had an impact as soon as the backguard came in, but Kelly responded quickly and ran forward to close the shot.
Still, Livingston continued to fool the guests to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy playing and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long transmission on their feet.
Led Holts could have increased their leadership on the locusts, but McGregor did well to deny Jacobs the opportunity before Lithgow ran to the point of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's backup, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell down, but Thomson pointed it away again.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a newspaper from our calendar “Sunny Morning”: September 30, 1882, a year ago 136 years ago, and AFFRAM... This is the day that future archaeologist John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to study and measure radioactivity, and that invention eventually led to a device called Geiger.
The Geiger meter has been established in the scientific world since then but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 “Bells of Coronado” movie, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: “What the hell is this? ”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger measuring device, used to detect radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put these hearing tools on you, you can hear the effects of the atoms due to radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “It really is going down right now! ”
“ Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.

Treatment includes taking immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory
Then they can “see” proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and are then injected back into the patient.
Experimental vaccine has shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months; the vaccine teaches immune cells to identify dangerous cancer cells.
The procedure involves taking immune cells from a patient and turning them into a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancer, then the cell is injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute, Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that the vaccine is very effective. ”
HER2 “lets various types of cancer stop growing, ” including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colon and rectum, said Berzofsky, professor.
A similar procedure in which immune cells are taken from patients and the “known” to attack cancer cells has been effective in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long monologue in support of Trump and carried MAGA there after appearing on the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well
Baulad was at Kanye West in Saturday Night Live’s studio after a long talk, where he commended President Donald Trump and said that he would invite himself to the president in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he carried Make America Great Derhufu, he spoke long against democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
“ I’ve talked to white people so often, saying: “How can you like Trump, he is a race - hater? ”
If I was worried about racial hatred, I would have long moved from the United States," he said.
The SNL began with a plug in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate judicial committee on the charges of Christine Blasey Ford for sexual harassment.
Although West’s long-term closure was not sent out, its recording was placed on community media by Chris Rock’s comedians.
It's not certain if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
Also, West had complained to the audience that he had received a bad backstage reception because of his captivatorship.
“ I was laid in a backstage.
They said to me: “Do not go up to the ground with this hat. ”
They laid me alone!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to the news from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole? ” and said that he would put on his superhero garment “because that means that you cannot order me to do things, do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments were made with a box from the viewers at least twice, and the actors SNL seemed ashamed, according to Variety, and one present said to the newspaper: “There was a silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to join the singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his field performance when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, the model of the conservative class TPUSA, who on Twitter said: “To one of the bravest souls: TAKE FOR THE VIEW OF THE MEAT. ”
On Twitter, however, the chatmate Karen Hunter said that West was simply to be “he himself and it’s absolutely wonderful. ”
“ But I did not choose to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “list ”), who I feel like supporting and spreading the ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the creature previously known as Kanye West. ”
He is not the first artist to change the name and feet in the footsteps of Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the musical legend Prince, who changed his name in symbol and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Charge for attempted murder after a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45 - year - old man has been accused of attempted murder after he was taken to a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to attend a courtroom in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Crying Games, criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fairy tales of the HBO, the Crying Games.
On the other hand, the actor, 31 years old, has criticized the standard picture of the male hero, saying that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be harsh in order to gain respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married her partner from the Crown Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions” on how to deal with this matter.
"Personally, I feel at the moment--what has gone wrong with the masculinity?"
“ What have we taught men in their growth, about the problems we see now? ”
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for an increase in toxic masculinity, because of a lot of male people on TV.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel like they have to be a type of man?
I think it's one of the most important questions of the day--how do we change this?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also admitted during the interview that he would not be playing in any other part of the games after the series was similar to the next summer and said that he had received “a lot of battlefields and horses. ”
From November on, Kit will play in the regeneration of True West, a picture by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a movie producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about having played in the games was having met his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these matters, so that they gave me my future family and my life after that, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover Jon Snow, who Kit played in these Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018, on the land of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Essation: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with the HIV virus or with AIDS.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Some 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were transmitted by sex, which is a change since before.
In the past, HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the donation of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus in this way has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus or AIDS has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Since 1997, homosexuality has not been illegal in China, but a major difference between LGBT and LGBT is still reported to occur.
Because of conservative values in the country, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections are caused by inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised access for all to HIV medicines as part of a plan to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked data from the senators of the Republicans, criticises “hazardous lies” and “conspiratory teachings”
On Saturday, Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied the accusation that one of her staff had published the personal information of three members of the Republican Senate on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said that these claims came from “super-righted” extremes and Web sites.
“ Lies, lies, and other horrible lies, ” said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published contained the addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of them from Utah.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown party at Capitol Hill during hearings with the Senate of Brett Kavanaugh, designated as a Supreme Court judge, on the grounds of sexual harassment.
Some time after the three senators had been interrogated by Kavanaugh, the leak came.
The conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState stated that the IP numbers identifying the source of the information were related to the Waters office and published information about one of its employees, as reported by Capitol Hill.
“ This unscrupulous accusation is absolutely wrong and pure lie, ” continued Waters.
“ My staff member — what personal information and security is now in danger because of these false accusations — had no responsibility in any way for this information leak.
This untruthful charge is absolutely wrong and pure lie."
Water’s statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, former White House News Agent.
“ This denial is full of anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“ It suggests that she does not have the mood to sit on a council.
When a person is accused of no reason, do not respond with anger.
It must not be opposition.
This is not to be asked for the cause of the accusation.
There must be peace and consideration."
Fleischer seemed to compare Water’s response to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics said was too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the provocative Republicans against Waters in the mid - seasons, also said his opinion on Twitter.
“ Larger if true, ” he disciplined.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had made “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials aware of these false claims.
“ We will make sure that the guilty are found, ” she continued, “and that they will be brought to justice for all that is corrupting and dangerous for all my employees. ”
Photo criticism for Johnny English Strikes again - a spy movie with Rowan Atkinson is shown to be powerful
It has become the custom today to look for Brexit references in all new forms of Britain, and it seems to be true in this resuscitation of the Johnny English comic series - which began in 2003 with the picture Johnny English and just awakened back to life in 2011 with the picture Johnny English Reborn.
Will this queer satire about how clearly miserable we are to be a new export tool for the country?
Whether it is or not, Johnny English has received a second - time renewal of permission to screw up all - his name shows above all that he is a creation designed for a show in other than English - speaking lands.
He is, of course, a wise intelligence officer who pretends to have a fascinating charm but is a little mix of Clouseau, a date of Mr. Bean and a little deleted by the man who played one note for the Chariots of Four at the opening festival of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the mysterious world citizen once played by Atkinson in the forgotten Barclaycard TV advertising, where he left everything in confusion.
There's one or two good things in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walk to a chopper dressed in a medieval brow, and the chopper blades hit his helmet.
The Atkinson clearly shows his jokes, but the mood seems rather unpowerful and strangely superficial, especially already “several” movies such as James Bond and Mission Impossible also offer fun.
It seems to be more for children than adults, and I felt that the adventures that Johnny English had had did not have as much of an idea and focus as the silent jokes of Mr. Beans.
The eternal foundation of the picture is that Britain is in great trouble.
A computer hijacker has been able to break into the secret British spy network, and has come up with the identity of all British spies, to a great extent for the spy on the watch - but there Kevin Eldon is unfortunately in too small a role.
This is the final piece for the prime minister, who is proud and divided of people and is already in great trouble because of a huge political enemy: Emma Thompson does his best with his role as a person to remind Theresa May, but the script is not up to many fish for her.
Her advisers tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already sat in a holy stone.
And there comes Johnny English itself, now head of school in some fine school, but also gives secret teaching in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers to a spy school that reminds you of the school of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets Bough, his former long - tired partner, Ben Miller playing again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that energyful role Vicki Pepperdine does not quite get to let his light shine.
The spying noise that screws up everything in Her Majesty's service is now back in the gear and meets the peril Ophelia Bulletovu, played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is to be impressed by the enchanting billionaire of technology, who says he can solve the computer problems of Britain: that's the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crash: they light up in a fine French restaurant disguised as slaves; they make a noise as they smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury ring, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to study the inn of Volta's house.
There is nothing to be saved in that final point, but although the picture is frail and energyy, some of its child material as a whole is found in it.
Medium stuff.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, could I not but think: can British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his abilities?
The workers ’ group refuses to make a plan for a four - day working week for the British, with the same salary as for five days a week.
The group of workers, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but will be paid for five.
According to the group, the group wants companies to make use of savings generated by the revolution in artificial intelligence and to benefit employees by receiving one extra day off.
In that case, staff may spend three days on weekends, without a reduction in wages.
Sources say that the idea would “match” with the economic strategy of the group and its policy of improving the benefits of workers.
The Trades Union Congress Association has supported the shortening of the work week for four days, allowing workers to make use of changes in the economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “A policy review is planned to be reported before the end of the year.
“ The change will not be in one night, but four days’ work week is a goal appropriate to the approach of the group to change the economy in the interests of workers and the overall industry of the group. ”
The workers’ party would not be the first group to support this idea, but the Green Group promised four days of work on its campaign in 2017.
The objective, however, is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A member of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not on the group’s policy, and the group is not considering introducing it. ”
John McDonnell, Minister of State for Economic Affairs, used the Labour Party Conference last week to describe his ideas about social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from “unknown presidencies” and“ caverns” of merchants.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get all their share back, since the government of the Workers’ Party could put on “absolute ” for alleged errors.
He has also confirmed plans to place employees on board executive committees and to create a common holding fund to place 10 percent of the property of private enterprises in their staff, which could receive 500 pounds of money each year in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI study at Kavanaugh could get them to change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has led to at least a weekly delay in the final vote on his appointment as a Supreme Court Judge, and raises the question of whether her findings could have the Republican senators withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, a reporter in the “60 minutes” Republican and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could reveal something that led them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his South Carolina collegiate.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“ I said when the trial began, I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusations were made and asked, “Did you do this? ”
He was determined, firm, indisputable."
Graham’s vote, however, seems unchangeable.
“ I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it took an amazing accusation to change it, ” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” Graham added and addressed Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone named by her name could not confirm that.
This case is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new will change."
What is the international festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York City, an annual music event in which a series of big stars will appear and with a similar impact; to end poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Civil Festival, and tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park, not only to listen to music scenes from among them Janet Jackson, Cardi B, Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to end poor by 2030.
The International Civil Festival, which was first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, a global struggle organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those who fight it.
To get a free ticket on the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), concert guests had to complete various projects, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending e-mails to any of the world’s leaders, calling a phone call, or using other valid means to help draw attention to their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival been, now that there are 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concerts really a way to convince people to call for action, or is it just one so - called “interaction” - where people feel they do something that matters by signing a list of demands on the Internet or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded by their supporters, calling for a variety of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped the world’s leaders to declare commitments and policies that amount to over $35 billion that will affect lives of over $2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications due to its operations, of which at least $10 billion have been invested or collected.
The group estimates that the amount of money gathered has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in Britain, who works to “help children to enjoy themselves to the full, ” and promised to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end up with malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“With the support of Britain’s government, its sponsors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of past malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullmann, representing The Power of Nutrition with audiences at London’s concerts in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were sent that Britain should improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On a list of common questions on the group’s website, one question is, “Why do you think you can end up in poverty? ”
Global Citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult task — sometimes we will fail constantly.
But, like the movement that fought for the rights of citizens and the removal of racial separation before us, we will reach our goal, for we are stronger together.
Amongst those who appear on the event this year are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York City and the introductions are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a “container” to prevent the energy export of Russians, says Minister for the Interior
“ If necessary, ” says Ryan Zink, U.S. Minister of the Interior, according to a report from Washington Examiner, “Dr.
Zinc claimed that aid from Russia to Syria, especially where the country works under the authority of the government there, was an excuse to explore a new market.
"I think their reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like in Eastern Europe and its southern parts," he should have said according to the sources.
And, according to official announcement, there are ways and means to resist it.
“ The United States can use the Navy to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to form obstacles to ensure that the energy from them is not on the market, ” he said.
Zinc addressed a meeting at the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called herself “the voice of energy consumption ” in the United States.
He went on to join Washington in dealing with Russia and Iran and told her to be more or less the same.
“The economic choice for Iran and Russia is more and less beneficial for energy supplies and replacing them with others,” he said, “and said Russia has only one game in its sleeve with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations follow that the Trumps regime wants to increase its exports to Europe and replace Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, official Trump employees, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” North Stream 2 project to set up a new energy supply, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the 11 billion dollars of North Stream 2 energy supply, which will double the current transport capacity up to 110 billion feet [110 billion m], is only an economic project.
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply delayed for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we have a view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the supplies,” said Aleksandr Novak, Minister for Energy, Russia, after a meeting with Rick Perry, Minister for Energy, U.S.A., in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticised by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial association of Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I am very displeased with the fact that foreign states share our energy supply, ” said Dieter Kempf, Chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Mr Putin, president of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will “consider seriously” to invite herself to the presidency in 2020, she says.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, on Saturday, said that she would “consider seriously” that she would invite herself to the president after the mid - term election.
Warren confirmed that she would consider inviting herself to a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“ It’s time for women to go to Washington and track our government, and then we need a woman as a leader, ” she said, according to a report from The Hill.
“ After November 6th, I will seriously consider inviting myself to the office of President. ”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting and said that he was “to take the land in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been unmistakable about his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court Judge.
On Friday, Warren told Twitter that “of course we must have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote is taken. ”
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that the majority of the voters in Warren’s state do not feel that she should volunteer in 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of “likely” voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not volunteer, according to a poll published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent claimed to support her offer.
The poll showed more support for Deval Patrick’s former governor, who claimed to support his potential offer, and 48 percent claimed to be against it.
Among other popular democrats discussed for possible presidential contributions in 2020 were Joe Biden, former Vice President, and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said that he was going to make a public decision in January, according to a report from Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the shock stress disorder Track Palin at a election meeting at Donald Trump
The 26 - year - old Track Palin was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
“My son is going through a great deal of trouble after coming back, I feel with other families who experience the effects of the stress disorder and the spiritual wounds with which our soldiers return home,” she said to listeners at a election meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room ” and said that her son and other warriors“ would come back only differently, they are harsh and wonder if any respect is given to what their military companions and the air force and other military departments have done for the land. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, for trying to prevent the announcement of domestic violence, and for arms abuse under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the police officer in Wasilla.
18 states and Washington D.C. support a challenge against a new asylum search strategy
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge against a new U.S. policy that denies victims who escape gang or home violence.
According to a report from NBC News, representatives of the 18 states and the city submitted a trial report on Friday in Washington to support the searcher who opposes the policy.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union presented against the federal policy, has not been given up.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons, who were walking members, ” had used her violence, but on July 20, U.S. government officials rejected her application for refuge.
She was put in custody in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems related to walking and home violence are increasing.
The new asylum search policy reverses the decision of the appeal committee of immigrants in 2014 to allow unwanted immigrants who fled home violence to apply for refuge.
Karl Racine, D.C.A., declared on Friday that the new policy “over a decade of state and international law. ”
“ Federal law requires a decision on all applications for asylum based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule, ” said the Court report.
In the report, the lawyers further stated that the policy that refused immigrants to enter was harmful to the economy of the United States, claiming that immigrants were more likely to set up a business and “provided an important workforce. ”
Jeff Sessions, a national prosecutor, ordered immigrants to stop giving a refuge to victims who fled home violence and walk violence in June.
“ Those who leave their country because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular community group or political opinion can apply for refuge, ” said Sessions in their announcement of the policy on June 11.
Helms were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in the race to find survivors in Pala, who double the number of dead
Conditions are becoming more and more difficult for survivors.
“ There is great tension in the air, ” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, when she comforted her sick son at the relief center in the city of Pala.
“ Sick cars bring a body here all the time.
There's little clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes and looking for their water - supply property to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals are overfull and damaged by the earthquake, which was measured at 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke their backs and shoulders, lay outside the Pala Army Hospital, where patients were required to be extra-doord because of continued strong resurgence.
The tears filled his eyes when he told of how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed up to the walls, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go for a wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "persecution" with "promotional advertisements"
A week after a public newspaper in China published a four - page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper to discuss the mutual benefits of trade between the two countries, the ambassador of China Peking accused the United States of using the U.S. media to distribute propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, spoke on Wednesday about the commercialization of the Chinese magazine Des Moines Register - which is the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accused China of trying to get involved in the U.S. Congresses that will be November 6, China denies this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. Congresses marketed what official U.S. agents told Reuter’s News Office that there was a new stage in a growing campaign from Washington to use China’s pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertising to promote business, Beijing and Washington are in constant business wars, with new customs duties on import goods in both countries.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that China’s revenge interpreters in the early business war were designed to harm immigrants in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trumps.
Terry Branstad, ambassador of the United States in China, and former governor of Iowa for a long time, a state that moved out a lot of farming supplies to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad, in his insidious opinion in the Sunday of Des Moines Register, stated that “China was now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free media. ”
“ By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the United States’s loving freedom of speech and our free media by publishing the cost of advertising in Des Moines Register, ” said Brynstad in his article.
“ In the back, there are few Protestants in the newsshops on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection can be found on the various views that the Chinese might have on the worrying economic policies of China, where the media are stuck under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party, ” he wrote.
He added that “one of the biggest newspapers in China came from the offer to publish” his article, but he did not say which magazine it was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female voters consider them for the mid-term election with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned against negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid-term hearings, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, who has suffered sexual harassment.
Very strong feelings have been around this issue, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted to start voting.
“ It is not possible to back up with these things, ” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Institute Maxwell School at Syracuse University, at The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Jeff Flake, the senator of the Republicans in Arizona, was calling on the FBI during the last minute of his investigation to calm down his voters.
“ Women will not forget what happened last night, they will not forget it tomorrow and not November, ” said Karine Jean-Pierre, president and spokesperson of the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang “November Draws Close! ” when protesting at the elders ’ walks, the Republicans who controlled the committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“ The interest and zeal of the voters will be out of control, ” said Stu Rothenberg, independent of a political writer, at the news website.
“ People will say that interest has already been great, and that is true.
But he could be bigger, especially in female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who don't like the president, but rarely choose."
The reporters predicted a setback if the Republicans were to press for confirmation of Kavanaugh, even for the testimony of Ford, where she described her accusations of sexual harassment from him.
“ This has become a big mess for the Republican Party, ” said Michael Still, former member of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s votes or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it’s also about how the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats, at the news station.
On the other hand, the United States seems to disagree with whom to believe according to both Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and nearly the majority support the latter.
A recent poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents probably believed the testimony from Ford, while 35 percent claimed to believe or likely the testimony of Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that they were likely to play Kavanaugh, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
The FBI is now investigating the accusations made by Ford and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to a report from the Guardian.
Ford witnessed the oath before the decision committee of the Senate last week, saying that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh had her sexual organs in front of her when they were both attending a party at Yale University during the 1990 ’ s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the network, is going to set up a seed business to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technological myth, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, the Open Workshop of Berners-Lee.
Solid enables users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access what information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in joke that the intention behind Inrupt was “world government. ”
"We have to do this now," he said about the seed business.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal data store on the Internet ” or POD.
It includes a list of contacts, list of tasks, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work - related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all present in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is absolutely up to the user who can get access to what information.
The company calls it “personal selection by using data.”
According to John Bruce, director of the company, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides employees, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Today, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security service purchased by IBM, some programmers hired as contractors to work in the project, and a group of programmers in volunteering.
From this week on, technology developers around the world could create their own independent programs with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not discussing “Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on the head in one night.
"We don't ask for permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday on Media that Inrupt had “the goal of creating energy in business and ecosystems that helps protect the honesty and quality of the new website based on Solid. ”
Berners-Lee replaced the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the discussion about the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he comes up with Inrupt.
“I’m full of optimism for the next period of the Internet, ” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Head of the Victorian Cross from World War I honoured
The only English priest to be honored with the Victoria Cross during the first world war that a soldier has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
On September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt, Father Bernard won the military position.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper, and he never learned that he had received the highest reputation of the British army.
Two of his grandfathers exposed a monument to him on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandfather’s sons, Michael Vann, said that the monument was exposed exactly 100 years from the performance of his grandfather’s glory.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Van Vant led his underprivileged army over the Canal de Saint-Quentin canal “through a very thick fog and under a hard gunfire. ”
Later, he ran to the line of fire, and with “a great deal of courage, ” he led the line ahead before attacking a cannon on his side and overturning three soldiers.
Colonel was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather’s heroic band was “something I could never do, but something that makes a man humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vatten, also laid a flower crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he would be “a great privilege of participating in the parade, ” adding that“ the daughters of a true hero are shown with the support so many show. ”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of seeing Gurru Pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the overfull Bellator 206, just to be denied to see the main event.
The program included 13 battles from San Jose, six of whom were shown live all night in Britain, Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences had an unexpected appearance when the broadcasts turned into Gurru Pig.
After all night, some were dissatisfied to watch the battle.
One admiral on Twitter described the switch to the child material as “some sort of sick joke. ”
“According to official regulations, the material was not suitable for audiences at six o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s material,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Marketing and Communication for Bellator, when he was asked to the broadcast.
"Gurra Pig, yes."
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said that they would go over their time plans and take the audiences in Britain into account in the future.
"I think that when I think about the replay, we could probably work it out," said Coker.
“ But it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday there, and we cannot solve it until Sunday of our time, which is Monday with them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, many text messages were sent forward and back, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought this was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a public problem.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We limit the evening to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and went beyond us.
This is a bad condition."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “disadvantage” because of sexual orientation
The Olympia immersive man Tom Daley says that he has felt displeasure with other people as a result of his sexual orientation, but that he has been encouraged to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different from anyone else” until he went to high school.
In the broadcast Desert Island Discs on the Radio 4 Channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope. ”
He also said that his parental role reduced his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual director, has taken a few months off from illness.
The first part of Laverne, Mr. Daley, said that he felt that he was “a smaller man ” than anyone else when he was a child, was because“ it was not agreed in society to enjoy both boys and girls. ”
“ Until today, ” he said, “these feelings of feeling lower and different have given me the power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “anything, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The dual Olympic Bridge Sea has been a great supporter of LGBT and used its participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legislate homosexuality.
He said that he was hearing because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The three times World Champion said that it had been “a surprise” to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar Prize winner 20 years earlier than said that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When a man goes through so much at his early age,” he participated in his first Olympic Games of 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later, he said that it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
In June, the couple adopted a child, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his “perceptive powers ” had been oppressed.
“ If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold prize, ” he said.
“ Know what, there are more important things than a gold prize in the Olympic Games.
Robbie is my Olympic Gold Prize."
His son is baptized in the head of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years of age, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had already received their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t say to him that he would not live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was not until his breath stopped and he was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible, ” he said.
The next year, Daley competed for the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze prize.
“I only knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, that I would dive in front of the audience at home in the Olympics, and that there was no feeling better, ” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goose-skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 p.m. to British State Time.
Mikelson in a bad shape, and he's dead on the class in Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will beat his record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old beat again so that it is not estimated around bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the 12th race, who is assessed, was assigned to sit on the class following the decision of President Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the hash’s course, as it has been so often before for the United States, the day of the fifth-time champion is divided between being a cheerleader and practicing the games on the field in the hope of correcting what he is doing.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot the foxes, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, where long globs often punish for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, the winner of the British Open, in the ninth game of Sunday. Molinari has a new team of Tommy Fleetwood and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the four - step - below Americans take the first of 12 single - game games, a good start could be the game of Mickelsons.
Fury declared confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“ He fully understood the role he had today, clapped on my back and took hold of me and said that he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
“ He has great confidence.
He's in the famous hall, and he's been so much better for the past than this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but that's how it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everybody else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fallo's record in a number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could bring the end to the process of the Ryder Cup, which has never been as high as other achievements on its file.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses, and 7 peers, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain vague effect on the team.
“ He’s funny, he’s sarcasm, he’s snuffy, he likes to make fun of people, and it’s great to have him in the joint room, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed working with him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, the leader of Europe knows that a great deal of advance can disappear quickly
European leader Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good start for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily change into unpleasant experiences.
The dance was first played in Valderrama in 1997, where a gate under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but it was right to press ahead at the end with the lowest possible score difference, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big head start in Valderrama, we had a big head start in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only right then,” said Björn, who is shown here, after watching the 2018 vintage work 5-3 on Friday and Saturday, and reaching the head start 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over yet.
We're going to make every effort tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not finished until all the levels are on the tablet.
We have our goal, and it's trying to win this cup, and we focus on it.
I've always said this, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we're very conscious of our resistance to the other team - the best golfer in the world."
Bjorn was delighted with how his players had faced a difficult situation and added: “I never get ahead of myself in this.
The morning will be different.
Tomorrow, it's the performance of the individuals that matters, and that's another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you play alone, you're trying to have all your talent as a golfer.
It is the message that has to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he also has to play his best game by himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Fury, will seek to make his players better in individual games than with partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this major transformation on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed “the miracle of Medinah. ”
“I remember every fucking word, ” he replied, asking how Ben Crenshaw, the leader of 1999, had continued to encourage his players before the last day.
“ We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
As the shrine builds up, it causes great pressure on the game that is in the center.
We sort our players according to that and let them play as we think we'll be doing the best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
“I chose these players in this row because I think they’re going all the way through,” said Bjorn about his choice of players in the individual competition.
The new German Armed Forces has been delayed again
The latest German Navy warship should have been built in 2014 to replace old military ships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until the first year of the next year for broken systems and increasing costs, according to local news.
Building on the “Rheinland-Palatinate”, the leadership of the brand-new military ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the sources of the military spoke to the Die Zeit magazine.
The ship was supposed to have been taken advantage of by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the delivery of the project.
The four of the Baden-Wuerttemberg classes ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to be replaced by the British Armed Forces, which have come to their year.
They should be equipped with more powerful cannons, many air and ship protection missiles and hiding techniques such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer periods of use - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their homes.
However, this ship of the most recent type - which is said to enable Germany to show its strength at sea - will become obsolete when it is finally taken advantage of, says Die Zeit.
The F125 heard the news last year when the German army officially refused to accept the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss release in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Although little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, the German media spoke of a number of women seriously “a defect in software and hardware” that made the military ship useless if it was sent to a campaign.
Software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg military ship will be controlled by 120 crews, half of which is less than on Bremen military ships.
It was also found that the ship was too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to make improvements in the future.
The 7,000 tons of ship “Rheinland-Palatinate” is thought to be twice the weight of ships of the same class as the Germans used during World War II.
Apart from hardware defects, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is starting to cause problems.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), but it was originally to be 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest ships are particularly important in view of the warning that German superiority is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, director of the German Congress Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was actually becoming “a body of operating ships. ”
The agent said that the problem had occurred over time, for older ships were decommissioned, but no ships came in their place.
He was sorry that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
The National Trust Natural Protection Association is spying on the secret life of leather ink
A new study in the highlands of Scotland aims to find out how bats use the landscape when fishing for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these individual flying mammals and help to guide natural conservation in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland Association, will monitor different types of leather flashes in the Inverewe plants in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be installed in key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the leather bladders over the period.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also take monitoring trips with hand-held sensors.
Experts will sound all recordings to find out the frequency of the bats and what kind of things do.
A map of the habitat and the report will then be published to produce a detailed picture of their behavior on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a NTS naturity Protective Counsellor, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of habitat is most important for the bats and how they are used of each type.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other associated species.
In the last century, bats have decreased considerably in Scotland and throughout Britain.
They are at risk from construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and lights can also pose risks, including fly paper and certain chemical treatments on construction materials, as well as domestic attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
On the other hand, their ears are much better than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because they are usually fishing at night.
They used advanced rock-making techniques to find insects and objects on their way.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares around the country, takes bats very seriously.
For the organizations, ten experts regularly perform checks, nest reviews, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only baton land of Scotland at the Threeave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten bats of Scotland have their homes.
David Thompson, the manager of the ranch, says that he is a perfect territory for them.
“ The area here at Threeave is great for bats, ” he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees, and plenty of good habitats.
But there is still much unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us understand better what they need to clean up."
He stressed the importance of checking bats before maintenance, since possible accidental destruction on one nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young people and destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected, and it is forbidden to kill them, to frustrate them, or to disturb them, or to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about bats, and we don’t know how well many of their species are going. ”
Ronaldo denies the accusations of rape when lawyers prepare a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called charges against him for rape “forgery news ” and says that people want to“ pay attention to themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the accusations.
The promotion of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's been said to have paid her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Some hours after the accusations were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, in Instagram Live video with 142 million of his followers, said that they were “fake news. ”
“ No, no, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion five times to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," added the actor to smiling.
According to Reuter’s newspaper office, the lawyers Ronaldos are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have called “inviolable disclosure of suspicions of personal life. ”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would demand a “harm of the same amount as the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
The alleged incident has occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he should have raped her in the rectum, according to documents submitted for the province of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on the knees of the incident and told her that he was “99 percent good man ” who died in temptation because of “1 percent. ”
The documents claim that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that it had both consents.
Mayorga argues that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but finally agreed to make peace outside the courtroom because she was “dead afraid of revenge” and was concerned about being “decreased publicly. ”
She now says that she wants to stop the smear because she is still in shock after a supposed incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was due, and this summer he went to Italian giant Juve with a EUR 100 million contract.
Brexit: Britain would “see after forever” to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “see after it forever ” if it lost its position as an international leader among car manufacturers by Brexit, says Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was “an issue of concern” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit without a contract were to be a real job, the effect would slow down the border.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis automobiles, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European countries.
“It is my opinion that if Britain falls out of the EU by the end of March, we will see production stations in our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed concerns about EU exit without agreeing on how to conduct inter-country trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that what manufacturers say is a chain of captivity risk if Brexit, without a contract, becomes a reality.
Toyota’s production line is based on acceptance at the “last minute”, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for cars manufactured after ordering.
If Britain withdraws from the EU without a contract on 29 March, there could be interference with the border which industry believes could lead to delay and lack of participation.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's stock in his factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Theresa May Chequers programme for a future relationship with the EU “was specifically aimed at preventing these views on the border.”
“We must have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us to enjoy not only success in today, but as an opportunity we can use ourselves,” he said on a radio show on BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with a very effective approach.
Toyota could not say how long their production would be stopped, but it warned that, for a long time, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a confidant of the trade union at the factory, said that his colleagues were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs never go away, they never come back.
The government’s spokesman said: “We have presented an accurate and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again, according to the White House.
On Sunday, the White House declared that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, an assistant prosecutor, could be “tasted again for one week,” now the conflict with Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President.
For weeks, history has been in Washington about whether Trump is going to run an assistant prosecutor, thereby endangering Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a recording device to discuss a conversation with Trump and the possibility of turning the President off the seat by using the 25th additional section of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But on the last Monday, he visited the White House, including the news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he “did not” want to drive Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed that he was not at the same time as the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI study on the charges against Kavanaugh, which further suspended the Senate vote.
Sarah Sander, Trump's media agent, was on a broadcast on Fox News Sunday.
When asked to attend a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not been decided on a date for him, it may be this week, and I think it is possible that he will be postponed for another week because of everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we see, and it's always my pleasure to inform the media."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The director Chris Wallace asked for its reasons.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not because of dissatisfaction over the fact that TV reporters had “visibility, ” but she said:“ I don’t disagree with the fact that they have sporadism. ”
She then provided evidence that a direct connection between Trumps and the media would increase.
“ The President answers more media questions than any other president has ever done, ” she said, without referring to the source: “We’ve gone over these figures. ”
“ If the media has an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do a lot of it over the last few weeks, and it'll replace the media when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown his reason for this week in New York, when he displayed his unimpaired and at times strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Minister for Health writes to EU staff in the health system in Scotland, due to the concern of Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to staff from the EU working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to declare the gratitude of the nation and wish it to continue to work after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months of leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of an application for an employment permit for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
Miss Freeman wrote in her letter: “Over summer, discussions between the UK and the EU have continued to take place on account of statements that are expected to be made in the autumn.
The British Government has also worked to prepare if there is no possibility of a contract being concluded.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I would like to make it clear again how much I appreciate the work of all the staff, no matter what their nationality is.
EU partners, and in many areas, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare activities and provide benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we want you to stay here very much."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after having had a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineer for the Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having had a head injury in 31-27 games against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, according to a report from Mike Organ, journalist Tennessee.
Rod Reed, director of Tennessee State, told reporters that the damage had been done shortly before half a game.
“ He came to the sideline and fell down there, ” said Reed.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a bar and carried out for a closer look.
An agent from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, radioman WSMV, Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there was “no information about the type or severity of the impact yet” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in the final year of school, plays his first period with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five funds all on Saturday before he left, which increased his total number of cookies to 18.
Foreign buyers will be caught up in higher pylons when they buy real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will be hit by higher pylons when buying real estate in Britain.
The operation will bring Corbyn’s campaign to an end in attracting young voters
Increases in the amount of plungers will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in Britain
A government fund estimates to earn £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be caught up in higher public debt when they buy real estate in Britain. The surplus will be used to help homeless people. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation will be considered to be an attempt to put an end to the success of the campaign Jeremy Corbyn to attract young voters by praising housing at more affordable prices and taxing people more.
Persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in Britain will have to pay higher plunger fees, and the surplus will take action by the government to help the homeless.
The increase - which is added to the current amount of the plunger, including the increase applied two years ago in an additional home and a real estate allowance for rent - could be up to three percent.
A government fund estimates that the increase will generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s new buildings are purchased by foreign parties, resulting in increases in prices and making it more difficult for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become “dreamy cities” because of the number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the amount of plungers to help other young people to have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel household allowances at an affordable price to fix the “house-time” of Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of valuable improvements in household affairs, including rent monitoring and the end of rentals without charge.
He also wants to give more authority to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “In the past, I said that I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream during my first period — that every new generation should have a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our useless real estate market.
The door of Britain will always open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for foreign parties and companies with headquarters abroad to buy homes as well as for successful British citizens.
For many, the dream of their own house is far too far away; and the shame of the homeless is still too real."
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland”
Jack Ross, Coach Sunderland, says that it is his “main goal” to become a coach of Scotland at some point.
This 42-year-old Scot now enjoys the challenge of blowing a new life in the North-East Club, which is now sitting in third place in the first ward, three steps from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Selection Department during the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I got hurt on my knees, and so it was over," said Ross in an interview with Sportssound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be possible if I were to work out the training of the division."
Ross’s predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Alloa Athletic Club said he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names of such a large club, but he had previously rejected training stations at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ As I am, I will measure my success by thinking, “Can I get this club back to the selection department? ”
This club has no doubt at home in the Selection Department because of its structure and situation," he said.
“ It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only look at myself as a success here if I come back up there with the club. ”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a training course for Hearts.
He helped Alloa to recover from falling into the third division, and changed St. Mirren, who was about to fall by division, to the next season.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he was ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
“ It was probably a real date, ” he says of the period when he became coach of Alloa.
“ I really believed that the coaching was suitable for me, even more than playing.
It sounds amazing, for I went well, I had a decent income of it and enjoyed the proper success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I am still going through stress and pressure from my job, but the coaching seems to me to be right.
I always wanted to train, and now I do. I've never felt better with myself in all my adult years."

The best time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a poll
This summer’s heat has proved to be profitable for a British bar that has a bass, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, there was a 2.7 - percent increase in the sale of crackers and tables, while in restaurants a 4.8 - percent decrease in the sales volume, according to numbers.
Peter Martin, of the CGA’s business consultant company, said: “The continuing sunshine and unexpected success of England in the world cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as in June, when barracks increased by 2.8 percent, except for what restaurants sold less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent in restaurants in June and got worse again in July.
Pubs and bars, which are mostly for drinking sales, stood by far the best with more swings while restaurants went down.
In the sun there was also difficulty in selling food, but not as much as in restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out drinking.
The sale of potable drinks and tables increased by 6.6 percent per month, but food stores decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the diagnostic company RSM, said: “These results remain on the swing we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social events or sports events are still the biggest factors in the sale of outside markets.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still face difficulties, even though sales reductions of 4.8 percent between months are particularly painful over continued cost - related pressure.
These long and hot summers could hardly come at a worse time for food sales, and only the time will reveal whether that temperate temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
The overall growth in sales in mobs and restaurants, including in newly opened sites, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowness of the openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the surveillance company with sales in the British mob bar and restaurant, collects and reports data from 47 management groups, with a total of 9 billion pounds, and is the industry target for the company.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, down to the age of 11, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the results of surveys.
A poll of 20,000 students showed an increase in the “genus of Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students say they have a "primary" account that they show to parents
One in five children, down to the age of 11, make secret accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A poll of 20,000 students showed a significant increase in the “genus of Insta” accounts — a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students said that they had a clean “primary” account to show parents, as well as secret accounts.
One mother, who fell onto a secret website of her 13 - year - old daughter, found a youth who urged others to “deprive me. ”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HRC showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts and half of them admitted to carrying secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “There is concern that so many youths are tempted to make an area on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “Red of Sportsmen” of the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the government.
Doyle is the happiest free sportswoman in Scotland and Ian Beattie, chairman of the Committee, said that the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her great experience in the international field during the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, Britain and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money to get it on the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can make my contribution and help to further the sport in Scotland. ”
The American, who worked among ananthrs 200 feet and 400 feet [400 m] of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, but a total of four Olympic gold, and is now a regular visitor to the BBC, became paralysed after a transient ischaemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would reveal whether I would recover and how much.
This has been a difficult job, but I did a lot of work, learned to walk again, and do sports practice today!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
A breast pump advertisement that compares mothers to cows causes a difference in the net
A company producing breast pumps is now mentioned on the Internet because of advertising that shows lactating mothers to cows that are milked.
The company Elvie published a clever advertisement to mark a presentation of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that can be carried on the outside. ” The advertisement is inspired by music videos and should show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers who are breast-feeding.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and kiss a song with words such as, “Yes, I’m milking, but you don’t see any tails on me” and, “If you didn’t notice, it’s not a weed but my chest. ”
The comment continues: “Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, pump, pump milk from the jullls. ”
However, the advertisement, published on the Facebook website of the company, has produced an online talk.
The video has 77,000 audiences and hundreds of comments and has had a different response from the viewers, many of whom say that it was ganting with the “hungry” that follows the milk industry.
“ Really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
As we do, they must become fattened and bear to produce milk, except what the calves are taken from them only a few days after they are born," said one comment.
The Elvie breast pump fits comfortably in the breast care provider (Elvie/Mother)
Another observer wrote: “A real challenge for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast-pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertising is completely out of time. ”
Others came to the defense of the advertisement, and one woman admitted that the song would be “expulsive. ”
“ I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt just like a cow when I was pumping my milk out.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a genius," wrote one of the audiences.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement that is directed towards mothers pumping milk (often in workplaces or in toilets) and feels like “cush. ”
This is not an advertisement that commends or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the women’s group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breast arms.
The idea behind the commercial campaign is based on many women saying that they feel like cows when they pump milk out.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or wires and fits comfortably into the chest restraint, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, co - director and manager of Mother, said: “The Riverie pump is so revolutionary that she understood a prominent presentation that would bring up a talk.
By likening women to cows, we wanted to direct the castlight to breast-pumping and all her challenges, even showing in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would give.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has found out about the news.
At London’s fashion week, two children presented a fashion show to the designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants moved quietly to camp at the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in custody has suddenly increased even though the number of cross-border residents has remained roughly the same, the reason being that harsh speech and policies put forward by the Trump government have made it more difficult to put children into a temporary pregnancy.
In general, foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have been afraid to put their chances of staying in the country at risk by offering themselves to father a child.
The risk increased in June, when the official authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults in the home would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the import control.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a head of the Finnish import and customs department, witnessed before the Senate and said that his institution had arrested a number of people who applied for the birth of single children.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on a criminal record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in a home that fosters children are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants on a criminal record.
“ That’s why we keep looking for them, ” said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up children’s affairs, representatives announced new rules requiring that some children appear in court within a month of being placed in custody, rather than after 60 days, which were the first criteria, according to personnel working in the elections.
Many of them will come through a video conference, rather than in their own person, to provide evidence of their legal standing before judges in immigrant matters.
The children who are convicted of being eligible for entry into the country are sent out of the country quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or escape attempts, according to the workers of the residences and reports published by the system over the past few months.
As spokesmen said, these problems were even more likely in a larger institution such as Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that a child has difficulty because of the number of them.
They added that the transfer of children to the tabernacle without giving sufficient time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could increase the shock that many of them are already facing.
Syria says that the U.S., France and Turkey are to withdraw immediately
Walid al-Moualem, Minister for Foreign Affairs, also said in his speech to the General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign army was illegal in Syria, under the false pretext that they fought against terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly. ”
“ They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions, ” he said to the council.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism was nearly over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this holy struggle until we clean up all Syrian territory“ out of both terrorist groups and all illegal foreign parties. ”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, where most of them train and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Syrians who fight against the President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - torn country.
As far as refugee affairs are concerned, Moualem said that circumstances were good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western countries” to“ spread out no reason for fear, ” which encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called upon an international community and a human society to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“ They make politics out of something that should only be a matter of humanity. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a neutral area at the last great battle of opposition created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a great deal of attack by the Syrian troops strengthened by the Russians, in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, on the other hand, stressed that the agreement had a “excellent deadline” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed towards the Jihadites, including the Nusra Front fighters, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, and that they “were destroyed. ”
Staffan de Mistura, ambassador of the United States, hopes to be able to attend the first meetings with a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition, to write a constitution for Syria after the war and to pay the street for the elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that her work should be limited to “a review of the regulations of the current government, ” and warned against all interventions.
Reasons why Trump will win another election period
According to this argument, Mr. Trump would win the re-elections by 2020, unless charges and scandals would end his presidency, as many liberal audiences are likely to hope for.
In what would be doubtless “the most dramatic end of a presidential career ever! ”
As you can see, the audience has no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, audiences at best have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN, and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and a factor of MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show,” has peaked audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
“ This is a fire that people are attracted to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of ABC dramatist “Designed Survivor” about a government employee who will be president after the House is completely destroyed by attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced joke writer and writer of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another point.
She remembers a trip to a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he was going to choose Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
“ He said, “Because he makes me laugh, ” said Miss Scovell to me.
There's an entertainment value in the mess.
However, unlike television, Washington’s stories could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrants’ families can be united and the health of the world economy.
Only those who enjoy what is the greatest privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than being an informed citizen when you look at the sixth time at the team of experts reasoning the use of Bob Woodwards on “the very near” sources for their book “Fear,” or $15,000 jacket made of ostrich that Paul Manafort wore (“the kind that is fed with pride”, Washington Post) and the consequences of detailed biological descriptions of Storm Daniels on Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again.
“Consequently, what he’s doing is making a person feel like a reality factor, is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director Wheelhouse Entertainment, author of the “Pawn Stars”, who discussed the employee business in Trump’s exhibition and daily changes in the narratives (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.L. and commending Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one factor, or you lose the thread.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, there was a 26 degree temperature and sunshine outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he remained indoors and looked at MSNB while he took up CNN.
He could not break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to witness before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“ I remember when we were creating all these crazy things in the old days, and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization, ” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“ I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right. ”

Money on the outside in the nearest elections of the middle period
It is not surprising that the 17th area of Pennsylvania sees the money flow to it, thanks to reorganization in the ideal areas that led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area sends the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another electoral area in special elections last summer.
Lamb invites himself to another representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old 12th elective region of Pennsylvania, who is now very closely involved in the new 17th.
The maps were reorganized after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court ruled in January that the old selection areas were organized in the interests of the Republicans and that they violate the Constitution.
The race for the new 17th place has started to compete in the funding of campaigning between the main funding partners of both categories, the Democratic Committee on the Elections (DCCC) and the Republican Election Committees (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in special elections in March before the 18th voting area in Pennsylvania, but many followed them.
The Republicans had previously been living for more than a decade, and Donald Trump, president of the ideal area, won 20 points.
Political experts have given democrats a little advance.
The United States thought about punishing El Salvador for support from China, but then stopped.
The government noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, with small objections from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama in June 2017, and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners drove the Trump team away.
The Foreign Ministry officials decided to call back the U.S. Ambassador of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for “new decisions to admit the Tenn no longer, ” said Heather Nauert, U.S.A.’s spokesperson in a declaration early this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received 140 million dollars from the United States for relief work in 2017, including for drug monitoring, development and financial support.
The penalties imposed, which included, among other things, a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the release of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American countries, with high levels of unemployment and mortality.
As internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed the Conference on Security and Economic Success and were to follow a similar meeting held last year and considered to be a step forward in action to prevent people from moving to the United States.
However, in mid - September, representatives of the top line made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending all the shortcomings of punishment against El Salvador.
Mike Pence, Vice President, is now addressing the conference, which is to be held in the middle of October, as a sign of its importance in the eyes of the government, said the reminiscents.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new message or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss further the discussions of the three U.S. representatives, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the inside argument against being left unnamed.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the government and also spoke about the issue of anonymity.
Let’s Learn History
The next scandal may be Robert Mueller's special prosecutor's report on possible measures by Mr Trump to prevent justice, but for that charge there are numerous official evidence.
It is also said that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign worked with Russia in attacking our elections.
If the Congress is controlled by another class, Trump may need to be responsible for it, as he prepares to meet his voters again, and perhaps the abdominal sentence of his appointed equals.
However, this is very uncertain, and I do not want to call for the fall of Trumps to be clear, nor for the fall of his colleague in Europe.
We all need to choose, both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect the length of our struggle.
In 1938, German rulers were prepared to rob Hitler, only if Western countries had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the calamities that followed.
History turns around such important points, speeding up or delaying the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing such an important sentence now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires the prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's fate investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had made secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was incompetent in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the news from Times is wrong.
“ How will we react if the newly requested FBI study at Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court Judge despite likely accusations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote for Congress in the middle season that will let Mr. Trump shoulder responsibility?
If we fall on these tests, the democracy will have to tire out long winters.
But I think we're not going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and was previously sitting in my ambassador’s home.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to turn on Sabbath candles on the table with the chin cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I but look in favour of our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Ranger's team, hope for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get up from the G-group of the European Union.
An injury to the knee prevented the centre guard Graham Dorrans from playing his first game during the season until the game against Error Area, which ended with a 2-2 draw, but he believes that Rangers can use the finals as a jumping board for better results.
“ It was good to get this point for us, for Villarreal is a strong team, ” said Dorrans, 31 years old.
“ We started the game in the belief that we could reach something and ended up taking one step.
Perhaps we could have endured a victory at the end, but overall, the equal was probably a reasonable outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got strong into the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European Union.
I hope we can reach three points, but it will be a difficult game because they did well in their last game, but with those who support us, I'm sure we're going to have a positive outcome.
The last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the place.
The team is good, and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can go further now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing pension savings
Although participants in the poll had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed this with their family members.
About half of the subjects in the Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long - term care with their mates.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children.
“People want family members to take care of it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have those conversations,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Insurance Department.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not give them a good warning about your wishes.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and when you are being cared for, because these options can change much at cost.
Get your financial advisor with you: Your adviser can also help you find a way to pay for this expense.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are standard life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay the cost, or self-insurance with your own money--as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal differences in advance.
Get your healthcare professional’s responsibility so that you can appoint someone you trust to supervise your health care and ensure that your health care professional will respond to your wishes if you cannot tell them directly yourself.
Consider, too, getting procurators for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is going to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please provide the exact information in your written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It’s not just about the finances, but also who the doctors are, ” Martin said.
“ What are the drugs?
Who will guard the dog?
Keep that plan ready."
A man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was repeatedly shot with an air gun when he was on his way home on foot after having been out having fun.
The victim is a man in his 50 ’ s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, abdomen, and hand.
Representatives describe the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 p.m. to a British local time, as “a random attack. ”
The victim did not see his attacker.
The man was not hurt life - threatening, and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 died after a powerful earthquake and a flood wave in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, representatives said, and the number of dead persons is expected to rise.
Since all communications are down, relief workers have not been able to provide any information from Doggala County, which is a region north of Pala, near the center of the earthquake, 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left to leave their homes in Pala after the calamity came upon them.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Doggila, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of central Sulawes and is located at the bottom of a narrow river on the west coast of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and the deluge were due.
Doggala is a region that covers over 380 miles [380 km] of shoreline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The local government, which is a regional government, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Danube coastal area.
Nickel study is also important in the province, most of which are in Morowali, which is on the beach opposite Sulawes.
A few times over the past century, according to Indonesia’s disaster institute, flood waves have washed down in Pala and Doggila.
In 1938 more than 200 people died when the floods and hundreds of houses in Doggila were destroyed.
In 1996, where nine died, there will also be floods in the western part of Doggala.
Indonesia sits on the active cycle of the Pacific and there are earthquakes on a regular basis.
Here are the major earthquakes and flood waves in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province of northern Sumatra was struck on December 26th and began a wave of floods that started in 14 lands and killed 226,000 people on the Indian coast line, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes crossed the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people die on the island of Nias, from the shore of Sumatra.
2006: Earthquake up to 6.8 on Richter crossed the southern part of Jöva, the largest island of Indonesia, and caused a wave of floods that exploded on the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: Earthquake up to 7.6 on Richter ran across the city of Padang, a capital city in the west of Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake up to 7.5 on Richter rode over one of the Mentawai island, near Sumatra, and raised up up to 10 meters high flood waves that destroyed many villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake raged over the Pidie Jaya County of Aceh and caused destruction and panic as people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and a flood wave in 2004.
There was no flood this time, but over 100 died when construction fell.
2018: Large quakes ride over the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, and over 500 people died, mainly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska, and president’s candidate, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, for trying to prevent domestic violence and resist arrest, according to a report from the Alaska State Police, published on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report alleged crime.
The Palin is held at the Mat-Su station where he waits for the hearings for judgment, and he is held against $500 insurance, according to a report from the KTUU.
On Saturday, when he was asked to declare guilt or innocence, he came to the news office.
Palin is accused of three class A offences, which means that he could be sentenced to prison for up to one year and had to pay $2500,000.
He has also been accused of a class B crime, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been accused.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now being dealt with before the Vegas Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing domestic violence from being reported, and of carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the groups of surrenderers in 2016 after she taught the shock stress disorder of her son’s violent behavior, following his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and wave in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - year - old earthquake in Richter started a flood wave and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems are down and the number of persons dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake was right in the middle of Sulawesi Island, northeastern of Jakarta, capital of Indonesia.

Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pala when the Deluge hit the beach.
The prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
New York prosecutors want the death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for a violation of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is thought to have taken the Home Depot truck on a taxi to attack people on a bicycle path along the street West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan, driving down walking and riding road users in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “willingly” and caused serious physical injuries “willingly, ” according to the order to use the death penalty, registered in the South District Court of New York.
Both of these accusers can lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Many weeks after the attack, Saipov’s 22 - generation federal court charged an allegation, including eight charges for murder for a criminal purpose, which is usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized criminal organizations, and Saipov was also accused of violent crime and of destroying the car.
The attack included “a relatively planned plan, ” declaring the actions of Sapiov as“ terrible, cruel, and immoral. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov became the cause of physical injury, injury and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Claves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” says the Will Declaration.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade ago, in the south of New York, the death penalty was the last one to be treated.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York City in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, couples who were killed after being convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both marriages were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of repentance during the days and months after the attack, according to legal documents.
He said to an investigator that he was comfortable with what he had done, said a police officer.
Saipov told the authorities that he had received the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, as stated in the charge.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said a police officer.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 parts of the charge.
David Patton, one of the official guards, said that they were “unwittingly disappointed” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to ask for a death penalty instead of accepting a death penalty declaration against life imprisonment without the possibility of a resolution will only prolong the impact of this event for all parties,” said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
The Congressman of the Academy says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “work the army of the people” today at a protest at the conservatives’ Conference.
This former leader, Ukip, said that politicians had to “find pressure” from doubters about the EU, at the same time as one of the Congressmen Theresa May suggested that he conduct the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative Peter Bone told the protesting passage in Birmingham that Britain would “be gone out” now if Mr. Farage were the leader of Brexit.
However, the challenge that May faces when it comes to making a deep distinction between her own team members was made more clearly known when conservatives who wish to remain in the EU took part in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has difficulties in keeping Chequer's plan in the right direction and is subject to criticism from those who are opposed to Brexit, those who are opposed to it, and the EU.
The allies claimed that she would continue to fight to reach agreement with Brussels despite opposition - and force those who oppose Brexit and the Workers' Party to choose between her plan and her “worship.”
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Means Leaven protest tunnel in Solihull that he wanted to “let Chequer’s plan go off.”
He suggested that Mr. Farage be involved and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“ If he were at the government, we would have gone out now, ” he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequer’s plan. ”
He explained his opposition to the EU, saying: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own law in our own country."
Mr. Bone pointed out from the evidence that the opinion of the public had changed from the elections in 2016: “The idea that the British public has changed its opinion and wants to stay is totally false. ”
Andrea Jenkys, a conservative supporter of Brexit, also in the protest tunnel, said to reporters: “I simply want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequer's plan is unpopular among the public, and opposition will not choose with it.
Please, stop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prior ministers keep the job when they keep their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians would have to “find pressure ” if they were to fail the decision taken following the vote in 2016.
“ It is now about trust between us — the people and our political party, ” he said.
“They want to try to betray Brexit and we are here together today to say to them, “We won’t let you get away with these things.”
He added in his messages to the crowds: “I want you to put pressure on your political party, which is about to be betrayed by Brexit.
We are active in the public army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters held protests in Birmingham, which ended a two-time protest meeting in the city centre.
A small group of operationists waved the flag against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party made jokes about security problems that came up in the phone program of the group when the conference was opened.
“ These are the people who tell us that it can have all the computer systems right, and all the technologies for Canada plus, for borders without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders, ” he added.
“ This is a total scandal.
There's no such thing as good Brexit," he said.
Warren is going to “remember seriously” to invite himself to the presidency.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senator, says that after the November election, he intends to “consider a serious offer to the presidency. ”
A report from Boston Globe reports that the massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a civil meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has invariably criticised Donald Trump President of the United States, offers a re-election in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, a co-director of the Trump election campaign in 2016 at Massachusetts.
She has been the center of the ignorance that she could offer herself against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with the inhabitants of her district, from the time Trump accepted office.
One present at the meeting asked her if she was planning to invite herself to the president.
Warren replied that it was time for “females to go to Washington and track our government, and then a woman also needs to be a leader. ”
Arresting after a fatal attack on Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
Baton Rouge police reported arrests at Dyteon Simpson, 20 years at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man who was seen on the tape.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near Southern University University University University, early Friday.
“Wayde Sims had a bullet wound in his head and died because of it, ” said Detective Murphy J. Paul, at the press on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde came to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had been on the scene, with weapons in his way, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without trouble and imprisoned by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two feet high and grew up in Baton Rouge, playing 32 games, of which 10 during the last season, playing an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, and reached 2.9 outcomes per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the prize seat on command from their team.
It was clear from the time that the Valtter Botttas took a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday’s start, that orders from the Mercedes team would play a big part in the race.
Botttas had a good start at the start and almost left Hamilton behind when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight against his partner.
Vittel first went to the pit and allowed Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been possible to decide.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one ring later and came out after the Vettel, but Hamilton came out after a near conflict where the driver Ferrari was forced to leave the inner side after having been at risk of remaining, after the defense attempts on the third corner.
Max Verstapen started in the back of the group and was in the seventh place at the end of the first cycle, on his 21th birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he delayed changing tyres to try to finish quickly and step out of Kimi Raikkonen and reach four seats.
He eventually went to the pit for a 44th round but could not increase the speed of the eight remaining rings, and Raikkonen took the fourth seat.
This is a difficult day, for Valtette stood up all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me out of my way.
The team has stood up wonderfully to achieve this result," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body expression.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, because of her statement that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with an accusation against Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, about sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not speak directly of the testimony from Ford to the decision committee of the Senate, saying that what went on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and untruthful. ”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and cruel and untruthful, ” he said.
“ When you see the lights and leaks and then say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you see this?
Remember her answer... did you look at the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I won't take it."
Wait a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't,' he said, and imitated the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the charges came from Ford against Kavanaugh, which was leaked early in September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“ I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, ” said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did as she asked me to. ”
But her denial did not seem to go well with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I'll tell you, it was really bad body expression.
Maybe it didn't hurt, but it was the worst body expression I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and urged that the Democrats be taking advantage of the charges.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods are needed.
You see the cruelty, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to choose to get control and control," said the President, according to a report from Mediaite.
Elite League Section: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two limits for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars added for their loss on Friday in the Elite League division against Belfast Giants, by winning the next game later, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants received an early two - mark advance from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie settled for locals, but Dwyer brought Giants back over.
Francois Bouchard, who used Dundee, and two boundaries from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen, then secured their victory.
This was the third game of the season before Adam Keefe, Elite League, who had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the team during the season, and the Giants had won the three before.
Dwyer scored the first target in a quarter of a minute, at 335 a.m., after a lead from Kendall McFaul. David Rutherford came with a lead when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Then there was a lot to be in the first few minutes, and Sullivan returned to the game when the clock showed 13.10, and Cownie returned from Matt Marquardt’s support in 15 minutes.
Dwyer saw to get the Giants over half a game when he scored his second goal in the game at the end of the first third game.
When Bouchard was one man in the 27th minute of the second third game, he and his family got together, and Bouchard returned by goal.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen get Dundee over for the first time in the game late in another third, and he secured his team victory with the fifth goal when half of the last third was over.
Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will receive Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
A flight manager will kill to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape an earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia has been honored as a hero after he died to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take off the air whole and the gear.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missed after a great earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and followed by a wave of floods.
Many of them continue to suffer, and many are trapped under ruins in the city of Pala.
In the 21 - year - old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his associates had fled the tower of government, which was overwhelmingly swinging at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Pala.
He stayed to make sure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake struck, could certainly succeed.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He later died in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision possibly saved hundreds of lives, according to a report from ABC News in Australia.
We prepare a helicopter from Balikpapan, California, to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, this morning he died before the helicopter reached Pala.
“ We are very sad to hear about this, ” he added.
The authorities fear that the speech of the dead might go more than a thousand when the country’s disaster institute says that access is limited to the towns of Doggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
“ It is estimated that the number of dead people is increasing, because many bodies are still under ruins and cannot be reached, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the institution’s spokesman.
Up to a hundred feet [6 m] high has caused an enormous destruction in Pala, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft are working on providing relief and supplies.
In an interview with Sky News, a 35 - year - old mother named Kusuma said: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There's little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, interviewed CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross competes to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widod, president of Indonesia, came to Pala on Sunday and said to the army of the country: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the missions related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said a report from CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes crossed Lombok, Indonesia, where over 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that the same thing is missing after the plane crashed into the loon
After saying that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane, the airline that had a plane that crashed into a lion in Micronesia is now saying that one man is missing.
Air Niugini reported that from Saturday afternoon, it did not know about the delivery of one male passenger.
The airline said that it worked with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, representatives said that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in a hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane had landed in the loon shortly before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had gone too far across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the aircraft’s approach was very low.
“ It was really good, ” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could water the waistdown and find emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots had been afraid and screaming and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were working a while away from making up a dock also helped rescue by using an inspired boat to transport people to land, before the plane sank for about 20 feet [30 m] deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Agency show that 111 people died in the plane crash of PNG-registered aircraft during the past two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
Expert describes the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in a re-opening trial against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the United States Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described how he used cell phone records to puzzle the accused, 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said that she had received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, on the contrary on his previous claims, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, a police officer went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed Saturday and said that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said that it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another difference was that Tellis said that she had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only been known for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact information from his phone.
“ He destroyed her, ” Hale said.
It is estimated that the guards will deliver their final speech on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected that the matter would be put before the abdomen later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip jump?
Hipp jump trio wants to fight against negative views against the music type by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop hope was removed from its origin, containing political messages and discussing social issues.
They want to seek the origin again and make conscious hippo jumps popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revolution in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Born in New York, a couple are suing for disfellowshipping after “prejudicing” text messages
Born in New York, a couple are prosecuted for illegal expulsion after she was accidentally given a text message from her mother, where she complained that she was a “other black person. ”
So the couple refuse to be prejudiced and liken the petition to “crow. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out that her new foster, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first arrived at work in 2016.
“NEEEEEIIII OTHER SPIRIT MANNESKJA,” wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the messages to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman, Dr. Maurice, reported that their ex - mother, who was black, had failed, and that she had expected to have a Filipino woman, according to a New York Post report.
Miss Maurice was paid for one of her work days and then sent home to Uber's car.
Maurice is now suing the couple and seeking compensation for her expulsion, that amount of 350 dollars a day for the six - month job she had originally hired, even though no contract had been signed.
“ I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do this, ” she said in an interview with Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is a difference. ”
The couple have objected to the accusations that they are prejudiced and say that it was the right thing to fire Maurice, for they felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“ My wife sent her a message she didn’t want to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced people," said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But who would trust their children in someone after showing such rudeness, even if it was a surprise?
His newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to “the treasury, ” saying that his wife had arrived seven months and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
That's not very nice," said Plasco, who works in the investment venture.
The matter is still before the court, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple in the community media and ashamed of their conduct and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers were afraid that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
“ It’s very funny now that we know of Paddington’s tremendous success. ”
She said that her father, who worked at the BBC before being inspired to write a children’s book about a small toy bear, had accepted his actions with a calmer positiveness and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was “loved” after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which she describes as “a very important family member, ” she added that her father had been silently proud of his success in the end.
“ He was a very quiet man, ” she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who does something, and you're proud of it even though you haven't really done anything.
I think he looked something like this at Paddington's success.
Though Paddington was creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the credit."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called me regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Since then, Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart rate up were gradually losing her activity and leaving her body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn't go to bed or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned for her dead daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the trouble she experienced.
"No one knew anything," she said.
“ I killed my head, and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a lot of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Anxious women hang up messages to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and telephone numbers that people can call and get help.
A 13 - year - old named Tyler, a son of Miss Davis, began to suffer from depression and suicide when he was 18 years old.
“I don’t want any parent to feel as I need to feel every day, ” she said.
Ms. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, saying that her son had been a successful chef with a contagious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, for he “was sunk down into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, 11 - year - old, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that there will be consequences for it. ”
Ms. Davis made the message “to let people know that they can go and talk to others, even friends.
Don't sit and say nothing. You need to talk to someone."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost his wife, Mark to 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about feeling bad or depressed or anything like that, ” she said.
“ Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his spirit.
He was up on his worst on Christmas day. When the children opened their presents, he didn't look in their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a shock to them, but they had to work out: “This tearing hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we must endure and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaughs hangs on blue thread as the FBI has its investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for — a study with limited time and scope — maybe we could get a little peace,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be “jointed apart” in the middle of differences between the classes where everything was in the trunk.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate the matter?
Their slowness is because of the timing.
In fact, in just five weeks, on November 6, the mid - term polls will be held in the middle of the year, and if Republicans are not doing so, as expected, they will seriously weaken their efforts to get their husband elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was a private secretary to Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its study report?
A vote will be held at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting as they are.
It is still not certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, which would enable President Mike Pence to break up the balance and confirm him in the office of the Supreme Court judge.
Number of people fleeing North Korea “decreases” under Kim
The number of people fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a Congressman from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the South Korea Joint Council and said that 1127 people had fled last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stronger border guards between North Korea and China, and higher charges were broken by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not published any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border that lies in North Korea, and it is easier to cross it than the well-being of the neutral area between North and South Korea.
China views refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
North and South Korea, which is still in war, has, technically speaking, improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions mainly about delayed negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was after a historic meeting in June between the United States President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in rough ways towards nuclear-free Korean.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, the Foreign Secretary of North Korea, taught American business farmers about the lack of progress since then.
“ Without any confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about our country’s security, and under such circumstances it is impossible to take down our nuclear weapons one-sidedly first, ” said Ri in his speech to the General Assembly of New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “mothersick” and says he is unfit to perform the work of a Supreme Court judge
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the regiment of the minority, called Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge named “Motherly Sick,” and told him too proud to be able to serve in the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, Pelosi had these words dropped into an interview.
“I couldn’t but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called a mother’s ill, ” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the decision - making committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he had attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both youths.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he cried up and got a cookie in his neck when he spoke to his family and school years.
He also publicly condemned the Democrats of the Committee and called the charges on him “an unholy and organized murder of reputation, ” organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss of presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial to democrats.
"I think that these statements and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is incompetent to the job," she said.
Pelosi did not answer when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if he is confirmed and if the Democrats reach the majority of the council.
“I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only incompetent to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now, ” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now serving as a judge at the appeal court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Health Law of the Deprived Care Act or the abortion laws of Roe v. Wade, where he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh turned to questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“ This is no time for a motherly, partial person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say “great is wonderful. ”
And women need to take advantage of it.
It is a righteous proverb; months and years of wrath flow out, and it does not come out without crying.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon, do you?"
She continued, “I received much assistance from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she was crying too when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and started to cry, she said to her interviewer, “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was very clever."
Wipes are permitted to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstandings.
One of my most clear memories of the previous job that I performed in an office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out of anger that I couldn't express, came an older woman and took into my neck drum. She was a cold boss that I had always feared a bit and she dragged me into the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
They don't know you're upset.
They believe that you are sad, and rejoice that you have come in."
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was on a presidential proposal, but she was then a senator of the Democratics from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair aboard a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew, Ms. Schroeder thought that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
“ It was not a well - planned decision, ” she said to me, 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone named this name "Mixed White and the Seven Dwarfs."
With a long run on the campaign, she was behind what was to be financed, so she promised not to volunteer unless she would be able to collect $2 million.
There was a loss of struggle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“ Do they think that I will be rejected? ” she wondered.
When she gave her talk and announced that she would not formally offer herself, she was so overwhelmed by feelings--thank the people who had supported her, resentment towards the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and focus their sights on the voters instead of representatives, and angered out into the difference of genders--that she burst into tears.
“ I could think I had a nervous breakdown, ” said Miss Schroeder, remembering how the media responded.
“ I think Kleenex is my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
The reason that a business war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first round of the business war between the United States and China was hot, and even though the war is far from over, between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the longer term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, shot the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing on the major exports of China, including solar batteries, steel, and aluminium.
This week, the highest rate came with new tariffs that cover products worth $200 billion ($150 billion), taxing as much as half of all products imported into the United States from China.
Peking has responded in the same way each time and recently put 5 to 10 percent of customs duties on American products worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States’s customs legislation, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be left behind.
In order to get Washington to jump, demands must be given, but it would be far too debilitating for Xi Jinping, president of China, to bow publicly to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing holds the cards right, the pressure from the commercial war with the United States could have a long - term positive effect on China by reducing the mutual need for both economies.
“The fact that an urgent political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to circumstances leading to economic collapse in one country is actually far more dangerous than the audiences have previously accepted,” said Abigail Grace, an investigator who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria “surgery prepared” for the return of refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for refugees to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad state after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, a foreign minister, spoke at the UN General Assembly and said that conditions in the country were improving.
“ Today, the conditions on earth are more stable and safer, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism, ” he said.
The government continues to face the usual situation by building areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
All of this is now ready for refugees to return to the land they were forced to leave because of terrorism and one - parallel economic decisions directed against their daily lives and jobs.
It is estimated that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more still living in the land need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would like to take assistance in rebuilding the country.
On the other hand, he stressed that they would not accept assistance in terms of conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by winning the United States team with the final score of 16.5 to 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutively on a European basis and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again reached the crown when the team, led by Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points needed to conquer the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had the most trouble in the race, struck his beginning into the water on a 16th hole, a par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and became 1 of 4 players to get the results from the start of the race in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5 / 4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was in the lowest position in the order of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who played potential in his second race for the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times on the Ryder Cup, became the winner of the race with 25.5 careers.
“ Usually I don’t cry, but today I can’t.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that I have chosen and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get that cup back.
This is about the team, and it was my pleasure to be able to help," said Garcia's emotional attitude after Europe's victory.
He handed his country the John Rahm tortoise, but he won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2/1 in a solo game on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him, ” said the 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the race for Ryder Cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 big titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had a hard time all weekend finding themselves in the field, apart from Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
The president of the United States, Jim Fury, said of disappointment with the performance of his team, “I am proud of them, they fought.
It was some morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'll take over for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA in the United States, and I'll call the Ryder Cup and we'll go on.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take it down.
They played better than we did."
