>>cmn_Hant<< When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from their original major populations (e.g., they cross mountains and rivers, or they reach a new island so easily that it is impossible to return), they usually find that their environment is different from what it was before.
>>cmn_Hant<< This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so new populations will require different characteristics or adaptability to become a strong competitor instead of those they previously needed.
>>cmn_Hant<< The original populations have not changed at all, and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
>>cmn_Hant<< Over time, new populations began to adapt to new environments, and they began to become increasingly less similar to other populations.
>>cmn_Hant<< After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will eventually look very different, so that they cannot be called the same species.
>>cmn_Hant<< We call this process "species formation", that is, the formation of new species. species formation is a corollary of evolution and is an extremely important part of evolution.

For example, the world's most common still image photography format is the 35mm format, which is the film size dominated by the end of the film era.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is still in production today, but more importantly its aspect ratio applied to the format of the digital camera's image sensor.
The actual size of the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high, so the format is actually a bit confusing.
Thus, the aspect ratio of this format (divide by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats, such as the APS format series, are the same or fairly close to this aspect ratio.
>>cmn_Hant<< The trivial method, which is often abused and ridiculed, is not lost in creating dynamics as a simple guiding method, but also keeps images in order.

>>cmn_Hant<< For example, one might say that cars inevitably contribute to the development of roads.
>>cmn_Hant<< However, only a handful of cars have a national road network, which is not economically feasible, so new modes of production should be born in order to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Volkswagen's high retention also leads to higher road accident rates.
Romanticism has strong cultural determinants. It derives from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, geography-related customs and cultures emerge, which are much better than arbitrary imposed laws because they harmonize with the localities in which society is located.

>>cmn_Hant<< Wild children may experience severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or left home.
>>cmn_Hant<< Others are said to have been raised by animals; some live in the wild alone.
>>cmn_Hant<< If the wolf child is raised entirely by non-human animals, the behavior (to the extent permitted by physical conditions) will be very similar to that animal, such as showing fear or indifference to humans.
>>cmn_Hant<< While the project learning method should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding learning method goes further.
>>cmn_Hant<< Bracketed teaching is not a learning method, but a means to assist people who have just learned to use a new computer program or start a new project.
Bracket teaching can be done online or offline, in other words, a teacher is a form of bracket teaching, just like the paper clip assistant in Microsoft Office.
>>cmn_Hant<< Virtual support internalization is used in software to question, prompt, and interpret programs that may be difficult for students to handle alone.
>>cmn_Hant<< Children are fostered for various reasons, for neglect, abuse, and even blackmail.
>>cmn_Hant<< No child should grow up in an environment where there is no upbringing, no care, no education, but something goes against it.
We think foster care is a safe place.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
>>cmn_Hant<< The foster care system should provide all the necessities that its native family lacks.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
>>cmn_Hant<< The distinctive features of the Internet add extra dimensions to its uses and ways of satisfying it.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, "learning" and "communication" are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In researching audience responses to websites, Emerson and McDermott (1998) cited "individual engagement" and "continuous relationships" as new motivators.
>>cmn_Hant<< The use of the video led to major discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions (face movements that last for a few milliseconds).
>>cmn_Hant<< Specifically, it is said that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting a microexpression.
Oliver Sacks points out in his paper "The President's Speech" that those who fail to understand the language due to a brain injury can still be able to accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
>>cmn_Hant<< He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior could be a shared skill for animals such as domestic dogs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two libraries of genetic variation: explicit and implicit.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mutations add new genetic variations, while selection removes the mutations from the pool of gene variations expressed.
>>cmn_Hant<< Due to separation and recombination, variations change back and forth between two libraries of each generation.
>>cmn_Hant<< On the savanna, primates have a human-like digestive system, and existing plant resources are difficult to meet primates' demand for amino acids.
>>cmn_Hant<< In addition, failing this will have serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and eventually death.
>>cmn_Hant<< The most easily available plant-based resource should be proteins in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting this protein unless cooked.
>>cmn_Hant<< In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only prone to digestion, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
>>cmn_Hant<< In summary, we should not be surprised if the pathway of our ancestors to solve the "protein problem" is the same as that used by chimpanzees in today's savanna.
>>cmn_Hant<< Sleep interruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
>>cmn_Hant<< This is easy to do, using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without being fully awakened.
>>cmn_Hant<< If you find yourself resetting the alarm while you sleep, you can put the alarm on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed to turn off the alarm.
>>cmn_Hant<< Other biorhythm-based options include heavy drinking liquids (especially water or tea—known to have a diuretic effect) before bedtime, forcing themselves to urinate.
>>cmn_Hant<< The degree of inner calm in a person is the opposite of physical and mental tension.
The less stress, the more active the vitality is. Everyone is likely to find absolute calm and satisfaction.
>>cmn_Hant<< Everyone can reach the realm of enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own tension and negativity.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and universal love methods.
>>cmn_Hant<< In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (initiation energy) is awakened through yoga posture, breathing exercises, reading and visual image.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Tian Yoga. To achieve the realm of enlightenment by visualizing different deities, purifying energy channels and activating chakras.
Germany was the common enemy of World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
>>cmn_Hant<< Two years after the war ended, former allies now became enemies, and the Cold War began.
The war lasted for 40 years and proxy troops fought in many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish line had been breached, and the only hope left was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and adapt the army.
After violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties that invaded Poland's eastern regions, more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and made positions in Belarus and Ukraine.
>>cmn_Hant<< To date, shipping is the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
>>cmn_Hant<< Traditionally, the Navy's task is to ensure that the State maintains the ability to transport personnel and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport their personnel and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II.
At the same time, the German navy, dominated by U-boats, tried to intercept the transport.
>>cmn_Hant<< If the Allies had failed then, Germany would have probably conquered Britain as much as the rest of Europe had conquered.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time in Iran's Zagros Mountains around 10,000 years ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< Ancient civilizations and tribes began domesticating them, consuming and using their milk, meat, fur and skin.
>>cmn_Hant<< Domestic goats are usually herded in groups of mountains or other pastoral areas, they are usually tended by goat herders (mostly children or teenagers), who are similar to the more widely known goat herders.These methods of grazing are still in use today.
The British built truck lanes as early as the 16th century.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the Mara railcars were simply carved from parallel planks, at the time, in the light of the slightly sloping road, these cars allowed the puller's horses to run faster and pull more.
However, people gradually realize that if you put iron on the rail, the rail will be more stable and effective.
>>cmn_Hant<< This became common practice, but iron tablets would make the wooden horse wheels more worn.
Eventually, the wooden wheel was replaced by the iron wheel.In 1767, the first all-rail track was introduced.
>>cmn_Hant<< The first known mode of transportation is walking. Two million years ago, with the advent of Homo erectus (meaning Homo erectus), humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestor Australopithecus had no habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specialization has been found in fossils from the Southern Ape between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although the Chadian Sahelanthropus may have walked on both legs as early as 7 million years ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< We can start living more environmentally, join the environmental movement, and even become environmental activists, to some extent reducing future disasters.
But if we don’t just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and eradicate it.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is obvious that due to human scientific and technological advances, the world has changed considerably, while overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of humans have made the problem even worse.
>>cmn_Hant<< The handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary General Charles Thomson was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 and then sent to the John Dunlap Printing Plant a few blocks away to print.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed overnight, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th and Washington read the letter to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The remaining 25 Dunlap single-sided editions are the earliest available versions of the document. The handwritten manuscript was not preserved.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have survived to this day, what we call "birds".
>>cmn_Hant<< Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
Birds are similar to dinosaurs.
>>cmn_Hant<< They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T. rex.
>>cmn_Hant<< Today, almost all computers in use are based on information that deals with binary encoding.
>>cmn_Hant<< Binary numbers can only take up one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary numbers, i.e. "bits" in computer terms.
>>cmn_Hant<< Intravenous poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are common and therefore cannot be diagnosed immediately.
>>cmn_Hant<< The most potent indicator of ingestion of poisons may be a container on site that is opened, containing a drug or household toxic chemicals.
See labels on poisons for specific first aid guidelines.
>>cmn_Hant<< Entomologists use the term "bug" to formally refer to this category of insects.
>>cmn_Hant<< The term derives from the familiarity with bedbugs, an insect that is very adapted to parasites.
>>cmn_Hant<< Both the hunting bug and the bedbug are nesting insects that are adapted to live in the host's nest or housing.
In various regions of the United States, there are about 40 million cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the disease has become a major neurological disease among young people.
>>cmn_Hant<< Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve).
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
>>cmn_Hant<< A couple may decide not to give birth for their own benefit, or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may develop adoption plans for their children.
>>cmn_Hant<< During adoption, biological parents terminate their rights as parents, so that another couple can raise their children.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods.
An experiment is an experiment that eliminates one or more possible hypotheses, but it is not the only way.
>>cmn_Hant<< Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
>>cmn_Hant<< Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were adopted one by one.
>>cmn_Hant<< With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West fell away from its Greek philosophies and scientific roots.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many of the physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers often depend heavily on the endogenous cycle and its existence through the biological clock.
This rhythm is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
>>cmn_Hant<< A biological clock is a self-sustaining swinging device that lasts a period of free-running cycles even without external cues.
Hershey and Chase’s experiment is one of the main signs that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, one labeled phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and one protein with radioactive sulfur.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a reproductive cell.
>>cmn_Hant<< Only mutations in the reproductive cells are inherited to the child, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts tourists interested in nature, including wildlife.
Activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birding, visiting parks and research ecosystems.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, visit, shoot and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
>>cmn_Hant<< Every morning, people drive out of small towns to work, and the place of work where they pass by with the people they pass by is where they leave.
>>cmn_Hant<< In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a private car-based transportation system.
Today, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer stabilize the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about it.
>>cmn_Hant<< In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or similar levels of bridge collapse.
Are Traffic Engineers Incompetent? Or More Essentially?
>>cmn_Hant<< Traffic flow studies are the movement of the driver and vehicle between the two points and the interaction between them.
>>cmn_Hant<< Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic because it is not possible to make 100% definite predictions about the driver's behavior.
>>cmn_Hant<< Fortunately, the driver's behavior tends to be within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a certain reasonable consistency that can be roughly expressed in mathematical terms.
>>cmn_Hant<< To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help road facility planning, designing and operations.
Insects are the first animals to fly in the air. Flight ability makes them easier to avoid enemies and more effective looking for food and mates.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most insects have an advantage in folding their wings backwards along the body.
>>cmn_Hant<< This gives them more small space to avoid predators.
>>cmn_Hant<< Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and centipedes.
>>cmn_Hant<< Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some people think he is right, but there are many people who disagree; they think the solar system is orbiting around the Earth, and so is the Sun (even other stars).
It makes sense because Earth doesn’t move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. Its water content is 8 times that of the second largest river.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections up to six miles wide.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of all rivers in the world.
The Amazon River drains 6387 kilometres (3,980 miles). The river comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the construction of the stone pyramid continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the grand scale and superb construction techniques of the Giza Pyramid were never surpassed.
>>cmn_Hant<< Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom period marveled at the monuments of over a thousand years old of their predecessors.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous country.
>>cmn_Hant<< Vatican City uses Italian in laws and regulations and official communications.
>>cmn_Hant<< Italian is also the language most people working in the country use daily, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
>>cmn_Hant<< All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
>>cmn_Hant<< Essential chemical elements such as gold, silver, copper have been known since ancient times, as these elements can be found in nature in natural form and are relatively easy to mine using original tools.
>>cmn_Hant<< The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that anything is made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is more like the four states of matter (sequentially unbroken): solids, liquids, gases, and plasma, but he also proposed theories that they would transform into new substances, constituting what we see.
>>cmn_Hant<< The alloy is essentially made of two or more metals mixed together. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
>>cmn_Hant<< Elements such as calcium, potassium belong to metals, such as silver and gold, of course they are also metals.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are also alloys that contain a small number of non-metallic elements (e.g. carbon).
>>cmn_Hant<< Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles known as atoms.
>>cmn_Hant<< Atoms are so tiny that they can accommodate trillions of atoms at the end of the sentence.
>>cmn_Hant<< As a result, a pencil became the heart of many people once it came out.
>>cmn_Hant<< Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing styles, the status of pencils is getting lower and less used.
People don't have to touch pens anymore.
You can only guess when the keyboard ends.
>>cmn_Hant<< The fission atomic bomb works as follows: It takes energy to bring together an atomic nucleus and many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a clunky little cart up the hill.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some atoms contain unstable atomic nuclei, which means they are likely to split with little or no stimuli.
>>cmn_Hant<< The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust.The outer layer of the Moon is called the Earth's crust.
The crust is nearly 70 km thick on the side and about 100 km on the far side.
>>cmn_Hant<< The crust is thinner below the dark side and thicker below the highlands.
>>cmn_Hant<< Because the Earth's crust is thinner, the near side may have more shade, and lava is easier to rise to the surface.
>>cmn_Hant<< At the heart of motivational content theory is the search for factors that identify or generate interest.
>>cmn_Hant<< These theories suggest that certain needs and/or desires are internalized when people mature to a certain extent into adulthood.
>>cmn_Hant<< These theories examine why some people want to do what they do, and what in their environment makes them do or don't do certain things.
>>cmn_Hant<< Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, when managers start leading past colleagues, there are two kinds of behavior.
>>cmn_Hant<< This type of manager is difficult to make inhumane decisions, and there are difficulties in enforcing disciplinary measures, performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and holding responsibilities accountable.
>>cmn_Hant<< In another extreme case, the person becomes a different individual than before, feeling that he/she must change what the team does and take the results for himself.
After all, leaders are ultimately responsible for team success.
>>cmn_Hant<< This behavior often leads to differences between leadership and other members of the team.
>>cmn_Hant<< Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as contact points.
>>cmn_Hant<< They tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their team may meet time for different time zones schedules, which local management may not understand.
The existence of true "invisible teams" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109), is also a unique part of virtual teams.
"Invisible team" means the management team to which each member reports. It sets standards for all members.
One of the goals of putting organizational learning into practice is innovation.
>>cmn_Hant<< Creativity and originality occur when all available resources are effectively utilized between functions of an organization.
>>cmn_Hant<< Therefore, an organization often brings new innovative processes to meet the needs of its customers in the process of working together to overcome obstacles.
>>cmn_Hant<< Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create an innovative culture, share knowledge, and conduct organized learning.
"Angels" (2006) interpreted the continuum scheme as a way to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research.
>>cmn_Hant<< The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can support the research of scientists.
>>cmn_Hant<< We have long known that different types of brain injury, trauma, lesions and tumors can have an effect on human behavior and cause certain mental functions to change.
>>cmn_Hant<< The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and working processes of the brain, which have never been seen before.
>>cmn_Hant<< This provides a wealth of information and materials for us to build simulation models that help us understand the process of brain functioning.
>>cmn_Hant<< AI has a strong sci-fi color, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, studying machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research involves making machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and scheduling, responding to customer diagnostics and customer problems.
All these become independent disciplines, providing solutions to real-life problems.
>>cmn_Hant<< AI systems are now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, and some home computers and video game software applications already have built-in AI systems.
Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers will gladly take students to places where buses can’t reach them.
Virtual field trips are high-tech solutions. Students can watch museum artifacts in the classroom, visit aquariums, or admire fine art.
>>cmn_Hant<< A virtual way to share field trips is also a good way to review trips and share experiences with later classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their state trip. The website is redesigned every year but older versions are saved online and used as scrapbooks.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills, although grammar and spelling are often sloppy when they start blogging.
>>cmn_Hant<< Students tend to be the most discerning readers, so bloggers start working to improve their writing and avoid being criticized.
In addition, blogging also "forces students' insight into the world around them."
Blogging is a collaborative tool that encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional schooling.
>>cmn_Hant<< "Appropriate use of blogs, "can make students more proficient in analyzing and thinking; by actively responding to web material, students can find their position in the context of others' articles and be able to present their views on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s capital city, charming and bilingual, highlighting a range of past and present art galleries and museums.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the undeveloped natural beauty of the Muskoka River and across the river.
>>cmn_Hant<< All of this makes Ontario a typical Canadian look for outsiders.
>>cmn_Hant<< Further north, the vast area is sparsely populated, and some areas are uninhabited wilderness.
>>cmn_Hant<< A surprising set of demographic comparisons: More African-Americans live in the United States than Canadian citizens.
>>cmn_Hant<< East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
>>cmn_Hant<< Madagascar is by far the largest island, still an independent continent for wildlife.
>>cmn_Hant<< Smaller islands are mostly independent countries, or belong to France, and they are known for their luxury beach resorts.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, a doctrine prevalent in the Comoros and Mayotte countries.
>>cmn_Hant<< Europe's influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Town route from Europe to India.
>>cmn_Hant<< The north borders the Sahel region; the south and west pro-Atlantic.
>>cmn_Hant<< Female: It is recommended that, regardless of actual marital status, all female visitors should say they are married.
Wearing a ring also helps (but not expensive).
>>cmn_Hant<< Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment; and that it is not uncommon for people to be followed, to grab their arms, etc.
>>cmn_Hant<< Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stick to your position (reject decisively, no matter the culture makes any difference!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenidians, and the port was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, and named it Casa Branca, which they did not abandon until after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. The Spanish merchants built a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of Morocco's most boring shopping destinations.
>>cmn_Hant<< Near the old town of Medina, shops selling traditional Moroccan goods and various gadgets such as Taj pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs are everywhere, but these shops are aimed at tourists.
>>cmn_Hant<< Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the easternmost part of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Nyiragongo Volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially the town's center.
>>cmn_Hant<< Despite Goma's count as safe, travel to any place outside Goma should be investigated beforehand in order to see if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province has eased.
>>cmn_Hant<< The city is also home to climbing Nyiragongo volcano and Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project.
You can visit Goma with boda-boda (rental motorbike). The normal (local) price for a short drive is 500 francs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Because of its relative remoteness, the "Timbuktu" was used to compare the distant exotic homeland.
>>cmn_Hant<< Today, while Timbuktu's reputation makes it a tourist destination and has an airport, it is a poor town.
>>cmn_Hant<< In 1990, it was listed on the Endangered World Heritage List due to the threat of deserts.
This is an important stop for Henry Louis Gates on the PBS "Miracle of the African World" special.
>>cmn_Hant<< The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, as it is more of an Arab style than an African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological areas that provide support for different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa’s main attractions and is considered the main attraction of the South African National Park System (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks,
With this card, you can access some of South Africa's parks or all of its national parks.
>>cmn_Hant<< Hong Kong Island is synonymous with Hong Kong area and a focal point for many visitors.
>>cmn_Hant<< The many buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are like a gleaming bar chart that is particularly striking under the lining of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
Best view from Hong Kong, leave the island and head across Kowloon.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclamation land on the North Shore.
This is a good starting point if you're looking for evidence of colonial history.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, 80 kilometres (50 miles) long, stretching from the coast to Bangladesh and inland India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This part of the forest within India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
>>cmn_Hant<< However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, but also contain some monuments of huge jungles that once were full of Ganges plains.
Sunderbens has an area of 3850 km2, of which about one third is water/swamp area.
Sunderbens has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. It is estimated that the district currently lives around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 3 million prune deer.
Buses depart all day from the inter-city bus station (cross river), but most of the buses, especially those going to the east and Jacar/Bumtang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Due to frequent bus arrivals, tickets are recommended.
Most areas can be reached by a comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster minibus.
To get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Pune (Nu 200), sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oiapoque River, connecting the Brazilian Oiapoque and Saint George of French Guiana.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high and the length of the bridge is 378 meters and there are two 3.50 meters wide lanes.
Under the bridge was cleared vertically 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011 but the traffic did not begin until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous groups living in the area of present-day Paraguay, and they lead semi-nomadic safari, as well as self-sufficient agricultural activities.
The Chaco area is home to other indigenous tribes such as Guaycuru and Payagua, who depend on hunting, gathering and fishing.
>>cmn_Hant<< Paraguay in the 16th century, once known as the "Grand Province of India", was the product of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.
Since the construction of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of the city's indigenous features and characteristics.
>>cmn_Hant<< Argentina is known for having the world's top polo teams and players.
The largest tournaments are held each year at the horse course of Las Cañitas in December.
Other days of the year, smaller tournaments and tournaments.
For tournament news and how to buy polo tickets,
>>cmn_Hant<< The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound, which is equivalent to the pound.
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
>>cmn_Hant<< British pound is generally common throughout the island, and Stanley's territory is often paid for with credit cards and dollars.
>>cmn_Hant<< On the periphery islands, credit cards may not be available but may be in Anglo-American currency; please contact the homeowner in advance to confirm acceptable payment methods.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the island, so it is to be exchanged before departing the island.
>>cmn_Hant<< Montevideo is located south of the equator, so it is winter in the northern hemisphere, where it is summer and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures often exceed 30 °C.
>>cmn_Hant<< Winter may appear cooler than it seems: temperatures are rarely below zero, but when the wind and humidity are combined, it can feel cooler than the temperature shown by the thermometer.
>>cmn_Hant<< There is no specific "rainy season" and "dry season" here: the rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Wild animals are after all, we should not feed or disturb them.
The park’s administrators said: Keep at least 100 yards/m away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/m away from all other wildlife!
>>cmn_Hant<< Almost all large animals, such as buffalo, moose, moose, bear, etc., are likely to attack humans no matter how meek they seem.
Each year, dozens of tourists are injured by their lack of proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous.
>>cmn_Hant<< In addition, pay attention to the smell that attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odor-producing foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay had a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the bay.
In addition to a British cruiser, the rest of the ships sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
