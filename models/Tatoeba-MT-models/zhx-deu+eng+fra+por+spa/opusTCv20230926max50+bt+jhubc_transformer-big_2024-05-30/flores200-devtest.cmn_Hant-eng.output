>>cmn_Hant<< Researchers at the University of Guelph have suggested that the two compounds will react with each other, creating crystals that impede kidney function.
>>cmn_Hant<< The researchers added melamine and melamine to cat urine and observed the crystals formed in it.
When compared by infrared spectrometry (FTIR), the composition of these crystals is consistent with the crystals found in the urine of the injured pet.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't know if you deny knowing this, but much of Central America's goods are entered into this country with tax-free treatment.

>>cmn_Hant<< Adekoya (Adekoya) was subsequently charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh County Court.
>>cmn_Hant<< She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but since her images have been widely distributed, any witness testimony could be contaminated.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the way Scottish justice operates is different, and the court held that distributing photographs would create potential bias.
>>cmn_Hant<< Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted, "If the suspect's photographs, etc., were released, the reporters did show that they were walking in danger. "

>>cmn_Hant<< A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported that the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador were forming new species of birds.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although it has been thought in the past that the evolutionary process of new species has been longer, researchers from the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Switzerland have found that this new species evolved within just two generations, a hybrid of the local endemic Darwinian sparrow (Geospiza fortes) and the exotic cactus sparrow (Geospiza fortes).
Gold can be shaped into shapes, it can be shaped into tiny shapes.
Kim can be extended into fine filaments, then wrapped and knitted.
>>cmn_Hant<< It can be made very thin and stick to other metals.Because it can be made very thin, sometimes it can also be used in a book titled "Silver Decorative Manuscripts" to decorate the hand-drawn drawings of them.
This is called chemical acidity. You can use lilac juice as an indicator.
>>cmn_Hant<< The kale juice changes color according to the acid-base level of the chemical.
Acid-base values (pH) are based on the amount of hydrogen ion in a chemical (the H in pH is hydrogen).
>>cmn_Hant<< Hydrogen ions are protons after the loss of electrons (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
The two sides of the water are separated from the palm of the hand, and the palm of the hand is separated from the palm.
>>cmn_Hant<< The moisture in your hand will react with the outer layer, thus creating an eccentric touch and forming a shell.
>>cmn_Hant<< Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro has a flush toilet and is connected to a sophisticated sewage treatment system.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the Minos towns of the Greek island of Crete and Santorini, people found remnants of the sewer system under the house.
>>cmn_Hant<< In ancient Egypt, Persia and China also had toilets.In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of mixed bath public baths for men and women.
>>cmn_Hant<< When calling friends who are far away from the sky, it's through a satellite.
>>cmn_Hant<< The artificial satellites in space receive the signal and reflect it back to Earth in an instant.
>>cmn_Hant<< Artificial satellites are sent into space by rockets.Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere sometimes distorts our light and sight.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is required to put a satellite or telescope into space.
>>cmn_Hant<< The wheel has changed the world in an amazing way...The greatest contribution the wheel has made to humanity is to provide us with a simpler and faster means of transportation.
>>cmn_Hant<< It has brought us trains, cars and other transport devices.
>>cmn_Hant<< Beneath them are a relatively large species of medium-sized cats, mainly feeding on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes and deer.
>>cmn_Hant<< Eventually many small cats (sometimes domestic cats) will also prey on a large number of small prey, including insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
>>cmn_Hant<< The secret to success lies in the idea of niche, that is, the work each cat does is unique so that they don't compete with each other.
>>cmn_Hant<< Lions are the most grouping cats and live in large groups known as lions.
>>cmn_Hant<< The lion population consists of one to three adult male lions, plus up to thirty female and young lions.
>>cmn_Hant<< The female lions are usually close to each other and are sisters and daughters in the same large family.
They are similar in behavior to wolves or dogs, both of which are unintentionally similar to lions (but do not include other large cats) and are very harsh on their prey.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tigers are all-round athletes who are able to climb (although not very delicate), swim, jump at a distance and have more than five times the pull of a strong human.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tigers and lions, leopards and jaguars belong to the same species (leopards).Only these four cat species have the ability to roar.
>>cmn_Hant<< The roaring of a tiger is not like the roaring of a lion's voice at all, but rather like a chaotic, screaming word.
>>cmn_Hant<< Puma cats like to eat small animals, and they hunt monkeys, snakes and rodents, and bird-hunting if they can. Puma cats prey are almost all much smaller than their size.
>>cmn_Hant<< Scientists believe that puma cats track and search for prey by olfactory sensing, and find out the location of prey by sniffing.
They have good night vision at night and can move silently. Tigercat hunts by blending with the surroundings and then jumping to prey.
>>cmn_Hant<< When a small group of organisms (a small group) is separated from the major communities from which they originate (e.g., crossing mountains or rivers, or moving to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they usually find themselves in a different environment than they used to be.
>>cmn_Hant<< This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different qualities or changes to be able to have a stronger competition than in the past.
>>cmn_Hant<< The original population had not changed at all, so it still needed the same adaptive functions as before.
>>cmn_Hant<< Over time, the nascent population began to adapt to the new environment, and their appearance became increasingly different from others.
>>cmn_Hant<< Eventually, after thousands of years, or even millions of years, these two groups will look very different so that they cannot be called the same species.
>>cmn_Hant<< This process is called seeding, which means that new species are produced. seeding is an unavoidable consequence of the evolutionary process and an important link.
>>cmn_Hant<< Plants make the oxygen that humans inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
>>cmn_Hant<< Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis.The plant can also provide shade at the same time.
>>cmn_Hant<< We build houses with plants, make clothes, and most of the food we eat is also plants; animals will not survive without plants.
>>cmn_Hant<< The genus was the top-level predator of that period, so they were not afraid of any creature except the rest of the genus.
His long jaw is covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and another set of teeth, which means that no creature can escape from his sight.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although uncertain, we believe that it may have a double tongue; it will eat turtles, large fishes, other daisies, and possibly even its peers.
>>cmn_Hant<< It will also attack anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex is not its opponent.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the food of the Romans is mostly unfamiliar to us, they do eat some strange or rare food such as boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of yak known as a sleeping mouse.
>>cmn_Hant<< Another difference is that when poor people and women sit in their chairs eating their food, the wealthy men like to join in the banquet and enjoy their meal on the side of the table.
>>cmn_Hant<< The dining in ancient Rome did not include food from the Americas or Asia into Europe in the later centuries.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and the ancient Romans had never eaten turkey.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, and those temples were considered the house of God.
>>cmn_Hant<< People will prepare offerings to God, while priests will strive to meet God's needs through rituals and festivities.
>>cmn_Hant<< Each temple has an open temple atrium, followed by an inner temple that is accessible only by priests.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some temples also feature a special pyramidal tower known as a tower temple.
>>cmn_Hant<< The top of the tower is a special temple of God.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house is less important.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most of the time in Jewish family life was spent outdoors.
Women would cook in the yard; the store was just a counter against the street.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are no large forests in Canaan's land, so timber is particularly expensive.
>>cmn_Hant<< Greenland is sparsely smoked ... In the Northern European epic, Red-haired Eric is expelled from Iceland for murder, and when he goes further west, he discovers Greenland and names it.
>>cmn_Hant<< But whatever his findings, the Eskimo tribe had already lived there by then.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although every country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
>>cmn_Hant<< If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there's a treasure map on the back of the American Declaration of Independence.
Although the back of the document has some handwritten content, it is not a treasure map.
The text on the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence is the original version of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.
While no one knows who wrote the text, it is certain that this huge parchment paper, which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches, was rolled up early.
>>cmn_Hant<< Therefore, it is likely that the addition of the phrase will only be done for the purpose of marking.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles set northern France free again, but the south remained unliberated.
The area was ruled by the French Vichy, who in 1940 got along with the Germans and worked with the aggressors rather than against them.
>>cmn_Hant<< On August 15, 1940, the Allies entered southern France, known as Operation Dragon Cavalry.
>>cmn_Hant<< In just two weeks, U.S. and Free French forces liberated Southern France and turned to Germany.
>>cmn_Hant<< Civilization is a unique culture shared by a group of populations that are significant in numbers and live and work together (i.e., society).
>>cmn_Hant<< The word "civilis" comes from the Latin word "civilis", meaning "of the citizen". it is related to the Latin words "civis" and "civitas", meaning the distinction between "civis" and "city or city-state", which in some ways also defines the scale of society.
>>cmn_Hant<< The city-state is the forerunner of the nation, and civilization and culture means passing on generations of knowledge, persistent cultural footprints and widespread diffusion.
>>cmn_Hant<< Smaller-scale cultures tend to disappear without leaving historical traces and cannot be recognized as orthodox civilizations.
>>cmn_Hant<< During the War of Independence, these thirteen states first formed a fragile central government (and Congress was its only institution) under the Confederate Statutes.
>>cmn_Hant<< Congress has no power to tax, and because there is no state administration or DOJ door, it must rely on the enforcement of laws by the power bodies of the states, which tend to be uncooperative to each other.
>>cmn_Hant<< It also has no authority to withdraw tax laws and tariffs between states.
>>cmn_Hant<< These ordinances require the unanimous consent of all states in order to make changes, and the states' attitude towards the central government is very hasty and their representatives are often absent.
>>cmn_Hant<< Both the Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, and they were the winners of the 2006 International Football Federation World Cup.
>>cmn_Hant<< Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bicycles, ice hockey, straight-wheel hockey and F1 racing.
>>cmn_Hant<< Winter sports programs are most popular in the Northern Territory, where Italians will also participate in relevant international and Olympic competitions.
With nearly 7,000 islands (one of the largest being the state), Japan is the 7th largest island in the world!
Since Japan has a group of islands, from a geographical point of view, Japan is often classified as an "island".
Taiwan's historical beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island's name as Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
>>cmn_Hant<< In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, opened a transformation of indigenous grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers to work in the company's rice and sugarcane fields.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) government seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan by force and declared it a province of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Maguan after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan.
>>cmn_Hant<< Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, divided into bolted sunstones, sun shrines and three-window temples.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most of the buildings on the edge of the monument complex have been reconstructed so that visitors can more clearly understand their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been repaired and the repairs continued to this day.
For example, the world's most popular static image photography format is 35 cm, which is also the main film size at the end of the analogue negative era.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is still in production today, but more importantly, the sensor component specification of the digital camera follows its long aspect ratio.
In fact, the format of the 35 mm is somewhat confusing, with a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
>>cmn_Hant<< The long aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12, to get the simplest integer ratio) is thus called 3:2.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many common formats (e.g. APS Advanced Photography System format) are equivalent or close to this aspect ratio in length.
>>cmn_Hant<< The often abused and ridiculed trilogy is a simple guideline that, at the same time creating dynamism, keeps the picture in order.
>>cmn_Hant<< It states that after dividing the image vertically and horizontally three equal points, the intersection of the lines is the most effective position for the shot of the main body (see example).
>>cmn_Hant<< During this period of European history, the already rich and powerful Catholic Church was scrutinized strictly.
>>cmn_Hant<< For more than a thousand years, despite the differences in language and customs, Christianity kept the nations of Europe close together.
>>cmn_Hant<< Its ubiquitous ability affects everyone, up to the king, down to the civilian.
>>cmn_Hant<< Christianity has a major creed that wealth must be used to help those who suffer and are poor, and the funds of the church are specifically set up for that reason.
>>cmn_Hant<< For more than a thousand years, the Church's core of power was located in Rome, a concentration of power and money, which caused many to question whether the Church did follow this creed.
>>cmn_Hant<< Soon after the outbreak of war, Britain began to launch a maritime blockade of Germany.
>>cmn_Hant<< This set of strategies to cut off the necessary military and civil-biological supplies does work, although this form of containment has violated international laws enacted and generally accepted by the various nations in the past two centuries through multiple international agreements.
>>cmn_Hant<< Britain placed mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire sea and even endangering neutral ships.
>>cmn_Hant<< Due to the countries' little reaction to the tactics, Germany therefore believed that their unrestricted submarine warfare would not cause a strong rebound.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the 1920s, the general attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
>>cmn_Hant<< After witnessing the fears and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid this situation happening again in the future.
>>cmn_Hant<< In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
>>cmn_Hant<< He came to the United States with a 4 cent, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the manager of his previous work) to Thomas Edison.
>>cmn_Hant<< Ancient China used unique ways to represent different periods; the various stages of China or the families in power belonged to very different dynasties.
The most famous of these is the Three Kingdoms era between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted 60 years.
>>cmn_Hant<< During these periods, a fierce war was waged between many nobles in order to compete for the throne.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people losing their lives in a struggle to sit on the throne in Xi'an's grand palace.
>>cmn_Hant<< The revolution produced many social and political levels of influence, such as the adoption of public-system measures, the conversion of authoritarianism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the state belonged to the people rather than the monarch alone.
>>cmn_Hant<< And after the revolution, the various positions were open to all men who were actively seeking employment, allowing the most willing and accomplished to take over.
>>cmn_Hant<< The same happened in the army, as they were no longer dividing the ranks by this time, but using talent as the benchmark.
>>cmn_Hant<< The French Revolution also inspired the forced working class of many other countries to spread the revolution.
>>cmn_Hant<< Muhammad was deeply interested in transcending this secular world.He often went to a cave meditation on the "Nur" (light) hill called "Hira".
>>cmn_Hant<< The cave itself has undergone a time change, presenting the birth-moving spiritual orientation of Muhammad.
>>cmn_Hant<< This cave is located on a hilltop north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
>>cmn_Hant<< In fact, even if one knows of its existence, it is not easy to find. Once inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
>>cmn_Hant<< Apart from the beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains, nothing can be seen; the interior of the cave can only see or hear a small part of the world.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only seven wonders of the world still standing today.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, and it was one of many large pyramid buildings built to commemorate the late Pharaohs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Located in the Giza Plateau or "Giza Pyramids" of the Valley of the Dead of Egypt, it contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest in the world), several small mausoleums, several temples and huge sphinxes.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Great Pyramid was built to honor Guff Pharaoh, while many smaller pyramids, mausoleums and temples were built to honor Guff's wives and family members.
>>cmn_Hant<< The "upper bow" marker looks like a V, and the "down bow" marker looks like a book-order needle, also like a square at the bottom opening.
>>cmn_Hant<< The top indicates that you should start pushing the bow from the tip of the bow, and the bottom indicates that you should start pulling the bow from the root of the bow (where your hand holds the bow).
>>cmn_Hant<< Upper bow marks usually represent a softer vocal, while lower bow marks represent a stronger and more firm vocal.
>>cmn_Hant<< Please feel free to mark with a pencil, but remember that the shipping bow mark printed on the page has a musical effect, so it should not be overlooked.
King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antony, and their two children, 11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis Charles, and the king's sister, Princess Elizabeth, were forced by a group of market women to relocate from the Palace of Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
>>cmn_Hant<< They returned to Paris in a carriage and were surrounded along the way by a mob of people who yelled at the king and queen and threatened with mouth.
>>cmn_Hant<< The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage.
>>cmn_Hant<< At some point, a mob member even waved the royal guard's head in front of the frightened queen, who was killed at Versailles Palace.
>>cmn_Hant<< American imperialism's war spending on the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
>>cmn_Hant<< They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, paying most of the government's expenses, while interest on bonds floated through the Wall Street Bank in the name of the Philippine government.
>>cmn_Hant<< Of course, the United States has long exploited the ultra-high profits made by Filipinos, becoming the basic gain of American imperialism.
>>cmn_Hant<< To understand the Templar Knights, one must understand the connections that prompted the organization to create.
>>cmn_Hant<< The times in which these events occurred are commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, i.e. the 11, 12 and 13th centuries of European history (1000–1300 CE).
>>cmn_Hant<< The mid-medieval pre-medieval period was undertaken, followed by the late Middle Ages, while it is traditionally believed that the Middle Ages ended around 1500.
>>cmn_Hant<< The term technology determinism encompasses many of the concepts that have been practiced, ranging from technology-driven or technology-led change, to the more rigorous "relevant logic behind the laws of science and the manifestations of science in technology will push human destiny".
>>cmn_Hant<< Most interpretations of technological determinism have two main ideas: that technology itself has a far greater influence in development than cultural or political factors, and that technology in turn "influences" socially inherent types rather than being governed by them.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, it has been said that cars will inevitably push the road forward.
>>cmn_Hant<< However, to create a national road network for a small number of cars did not meet the economic effect, and people developed new manufacturing methods to reduce the cost of car ownership.
>>cmn_Hant<< The increased number of people who own cars will also increase the chances of road accidents, leading to the development of new medical techniques for repairing injured limbs by humans.
>>cmn_Hant<< Cultural determinism is one of the important constructs of Romanticism, drawn mostly from writers such as Goethe, Fechter and Schlegel.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the context of Romanticism, the geographical environment shapes the individual and over time produces customs and cultures associated with the geographical environment.These customs and cultures are better than the laws enforced arbitrarily because of harmony with local society.
>>cmn_Hant<< Like Paris, which was reputed as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was also reputed as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It has a reputation as a luxury center, starting around 400 years west, and continuing all the way to about 1100 west.
Its status gradually declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were worth more than what was sold in the Byzantine market.
>>cmn_Hant<< It was at this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th to 11th centuries and 14th centuries.
>>cmn_Hant<< Initially, the garment was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slowness of the communication pipeline, the Western style may fall behind 25 to 30 years.
>>cmn_Hant<< Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a unique style. a major development at the time was that members of the crusaders began to fix their clothes with the lattice.
>>cmn_Hant<< Self-sufficient agriculture is the type of agriculture where crop production is only enough to keep farmers and their families warm.
>>cmn_Hant<< Self-sufficient agriculture is a mere agricultural system that usually adopts organic farming, preserves and uses the seeds of native crops in the local ecoregion, and adopts wheeling or other relatively simple techniques to increase production.
>>cmn_Hant<< Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and many developing countries have continued to do so.
>>cmn_Hant<< Subcultures make preferences similar, and also people who feel neglected by the mainstream of society come together to develop a sense of identity.
>>cmn_Hant<< Subcultures will be distinctive because of the age level, race, class, geographical location or gender of the members.
>>cmn_Hant<< The qualities that enable subcultures to be established may be the combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography or various factors.
>>cmn_Hant<< Members of the subculture usually show their belonging to the group through a special, symbolic form, which includes dressage, behavioral behavior and the use of adjectives.
>>cmn_Hant<< One method commonly used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to raise several unfortunate cases where children are subjected to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during the process of growth and thus not being given an adult to the process of socialization.
>>cmn_Hant<< Such children are known as "wild children." Some of them have been imprisoned (often also parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because parents do not accept the child's intellectual or physical impairment.
>>cmn_Hant<< Street children may experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away from home.
>>cmn_Hant<< Other children are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
>>cmn_Hant<< If the wild child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it behaves almost exactly the same way as the animal that takes care of him (physiological conditions permitting it), such as showing fear or apathy towards humans.
>>cmn_Hant<< The project-based approach to learning makes learning easier and more fun, with eagle-framed learning on the other side of the floor.
>>cmn_Hant<< Eagle-mounted teaching is not a learning method, but an aid that provides support for people who are experiencing a new learning experience (e.g., using a new computer program or starting a new project, etc.).
>>cmn_Hant<< Eagle frames can be both virtual and physical, in other words, the instructor and Microsoft Office's Retriever needle small helper are a type of Eagle frame.
>>cmn_Hant<< Virtual eagle racks have been built into the software, and the function is to ask questions, prompts and illustrate programs that students may find difficult to handle on their own.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are many reasons why children are sent to foster care centers, including neglect of care, abuse, and even extortion.
>>cmn_Hant<< No child should grow up in an environment that lacks nurturing, care and education, but the reality is not.
>>cmn_Hant<< We believe that the foster care system is a haven for these children.
>>cmn_Hant<< Our foster care system should provide safe homes, full of caring caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
>>cmn_Hant<< Foster families should provide all the necessities they lacked in previous families.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Internet combines the two elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
>>cmn_Hant<< From the point of view of use and satisfaction, the distinct characteristics of the Internet open new realms.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, both "learning" and "socialization" can be said to be important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
>>cmn_Hant<< Eighmey and McCord (1998) investigated the reactions of audiences to the site in their thesis, and found that "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also new motivational layers.
>>cmn_Hant<< The operation of the video has brought significant discoveries for decoding microexpressions and maintaining face movements for only a few milliseconds.
>>cmn_Hant<< In particular, it has been thought that microexpressions can be interpreted correctly to detect if a person is lying.
>>cmn_Hant<< In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks states that people who cannot understand the contents of the speech because of brain damage can still accurately feel the sincerity of the speaker.
>>cmn_Hant<< He even argues that animals such as domestic dogs may have this ability to explain human behavior.
>>cmn_Hant<< Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two types of genetic variation: implicit and explicit.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mutations increase new genetic variation, while natural selection removes it from the conspicuous mutants.
>>cmn_Hant<< Each generation, separation and recombination will cause the two sets of genes that are explicit and recessive to constantly change.
>>cmn_Hant<< The digestive system resembles human primates, making it difficult to ingeste enough amino acids from plants on the prairie.
>>cmn_Hant<< In addition, inadequate intake of amino acids can lead to serious consequences: poor growth and malnutrition, ultimately leading to death.
>>cmn_Hant<< The most accessible plant resources should be proteins available in leaves and beans, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ant, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide quality proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
>>cmn_Hant<< After considering all the factors, we don't need to be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a manner similar to chimpanzees on the present recklessness.
>>cmn_Hant<< A sleep interruption means a process of deliberately waking up during a general sleep and falling asleep again for a short period of time (10-60 minutes later).
>>cmn_Hant<< This can be done easily by using relatively quiet alarms that make you conscious without waking up completely.
>>cmn_Hant<< If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, you can put the alarm on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed and turn off the alarm.
>>cmn_Hant<< Other options based on the physiological cycle include drinking a large amount of liquid (especially water or tea, a recognized diuretic) before bedtime, which causes people to have to get up and urinate.
>>cmn_Hant<< The level of calm within a person is inversely proportional to the level of physical and mental tension of a person.
The more relaxed you are, the more vital you have. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only obstacle to enlightenment is our own anxiety and negative energy.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but because of the road of Mahayana Buddhism's love and many techniques of Indian yoga, it allows Tibetan Buddhism to be enlightened.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, including the Kandalini yoga, meditation and devotional practice that embraces all beings.
>>cmn_Hant<< While doing kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) will be revived through yoga actions, breathing exercises, mantra prayers and visualizations.
>>cmn_Hant<< The core of meditation in Tibetan Buddhism is the Zen Yoga. By contemplating the Buddha, purify all energy channels, activate the pulse wheel, and create enlightenment consciousness.
>>cmn_Hant<< Germany was a common enemy during World War II, prompting the Soviet Union to cooperate with the United States. With the end of the war, conflicts of institutions, practices and cultural aspects have put these countries at a standstill.
>>cmn_Hant<< Only two years after World War II ended, the original allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
>>cmn_Hant<< It lasted forty years in succession, and was conducted by proxy troops in real combat from Africa to Asia, on the battlefields of Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
At the time of September 17, 1939, the Polish line was lost, with the only hope of retreating and reorganizing next to the bridgehead in Romania.
>>cmn_Hant<< However, all of these plans were scrapped overnight...More than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Pozna<0xC5><0x84> Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements invaded eastern Poland and subsequently entered Belarus and Ukraine, forming the Belarusian-Ukrainian front.
>>cmn_Hant<< The use of ships to transport cargo is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
>>cmn_Hant<< Traditionally, the Navy's mission was to ensure that the country can safely transfer people and goods while interfering with the operations of enemy transfers of people and goods.
>>cmn_Hant<< One of the most recent examples of this concern is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies to the other side of the Atlantic to help Britain.
>>cmn_Hant<< At the same time, the German Navy attempted to block transport (mainly U-boats).
>>cmn_Hant<< If the Allies were defeated, Germany might conquer Britain as much as the rest of Europe.
>>cmn_Hant<< The goat appears to have been domesticated for the first time in Iran's Zaglos Mountains around 10,000 years ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< Ancient cultures and tribes began to feed them in order to obtain milk, hair, meat and skin.
>>cmn_Hant<< Breeding goats are generally found in hilly or other grazing areas, and are usually taken care of by the shepherds of children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherds.These grazing methods are still used by people today.
>>cmn_Hant<< England built the Mara track as early as the sixteenth century.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the four-wheel cargo track consists of only parallel plank strips, it allows horses to haul goods on the track, compared to the slightly squishy pavement at the time, delivering faster speeds and being able to load more.
But gradually, people found it more efficient if they paved the rails.
>>cmn_Hant<< This became a common practice, but iron would cause more wear on the wagon's wooden wheels.
>>cmn_Hant<< Eventually, the iron wheel replaced the wooden wheel.In 1767, the first all-iron railway was asked about.
>>cmn_Hant<< The first known transport was walking, and with the advent of Homo Erectus (i.e. upright man), humans began to walk upright two million years ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< Their evolutionary predecessor, the Australopithecus, is not accustomed to upright walking.
>>cmn_Hant<< Characteristics of bipedal exercise have been found in Australopithecus fossils between 420 and 3.9 million years ago, although Chadian apes may have walked bipedal as early as seven million years ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< We can start living a more environmentally friendly life, we can engage in an environmental campaign, and we can even become activists to minimize future suffering.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is in many cases the same as "head pain medicine, foot pain medicine." But, if we want more than a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and then solve them thoroughly.
>>cmn_Hant<< The world has changed because of advances in human science and technology, and because of overpopulation and the way of life wasted by humans, the problem has become even more acute, which is obvious.
>>cmn_Hant<< After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the John Dunlap printing house a few blocks away.
>>cmn_Hant<< 150 to 200 copies were printed all night, now known as the Single-Sided Printed Edition of the Lep.
The document was read by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall for the first time on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and George Washington read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
>>cmn_Hant<< The 25 still-existing single-sided print editions of the Lippe are the oldest surviving editions of this document, and the original manuscript is not.
>>cmn_Hant<< Today, many paleontologists believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survive to modern times, which we call birds.
>>cmn_Hant<< Because they have feathers and are able to fly, many do not consider them to be a type of dinosaur.
>>cmn_Hant<< But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
>>cmn_Hant<< They have scales and claws on their feet, will lay eggs, and will walk with two hind feet like Tyrannosaurus.
>>cmn_Hant<< In fact, now all computers are based on messages consisting of operating binary code.
>>cmn_Hant<< A binary number can only have one of either 0 or 1 values, and these numbers are called binary numbers, or bits called by computer terms.
The symptoms of vomiting are too prevalent and cannot be diagnosed directly.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is best to judge the signs of poisoning in the body, and may be found to have a container of open drugs or toxic household chemicals.
>>cmn_Hant<< Review the first aid instructions on the specific poison label.
>>cmn_Hant<< The term "stink bug" is an official term for this type of insect by entomologists.
>>cmn_Hant<< The name comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs—they are highly adapted to parasitic insects.
>>cmn_Hant<< Both the hunting and bed bugs have properties that grow within the nest and can adapt to life in the nest or in the home of its host.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
>>cmn_Hant<< Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system such as the brain, spinal cord and the optic nerve.
>>cmn_Hant<< The study found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis than men.
>>cmn_Hant<< Couples may recognize that the upbringing of a baby is not in their or children's best interests.
>>cmn_Hant<< These partners can choose the plan to adopt their children.
>>cmn_Hant<< Adoption refers to the termination of parental rights by the parent so that another couple can raise their children.
>>cmn_Hant<< The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through scientific methods...This method actually leads to much scientific research as well.
>>cmn_Hant<< But experimental law is not the only one, and experimentation is the ability to eliminate one or more hypothetical tests, and asking questions and conducting observations can also lead scientific research.
>>cmn_Hant<< Biographers and philosophers focused on the classic texts, especially the Latin Bible.
>>cmn_Hant<< All scientific problem views of Aristotle, including psychology, are accepted.
>>cmn_Hant<< With the fall of Greek studies, the Western world disconnected its roots from Greek philosophy and science.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many scholars observe the rhythms of physiology and behavior, usually highly dependent on the cycle of innate biology, and its substances produced with the physiological clock.
>>cmn_Hant<< Not only is the cycle rhythm that responds to external cycle threads, it can be observed in most organisms such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
>>cmn_Hant<< The physiological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator and will continue to operate autonomously even without an external signal.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Hershey-ZEISS experiment was one of the main experiments that showed DNA as a legacy substance.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in bacteria.
>>cmn_Hant<< They conducted two experiments, one using DNA in radioactive phosphorous labeled phages, and the other using proteins from radioactive sulfur labeled phages.
>>cmn_Hant<< Depending on the species of mutation, the importance of the affected relics, and whether the affected cell is a reproductive cell, mutations can have a variety of different effects.
>>cmn_Hant<< Only mutations in reproductive cell line cells are inherited to their children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
>>cmn_Hant<< The nature-themed travel itinerary will draw people interested in nature to participate in the enjoyment of natural scenery, including wildlife.
>>cmn_Hant<< Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birding, and information on visits to parks and study ecosystems.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, visiting Borneo, shooting and understanding orangutans.
>>cmn_Hant<< Every morning, a group of people drove out of the small town of the country to go to the work place and pass by with another group of people who were exactly where the other group was going to work.
>>cmn_Hant<< In this hectic traffic, everyone has some degree of connection with this private car-based transportation system and supports its existence.
>>cmn_Hant<< Today, science points out that such a large-scale carbon-economic activity has lifted the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
>>cmn_Hant<< Everyone is involved in social activities, using transportation systems...almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
>>cmn_Hant<< In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality and bridge collapse.
>>cmn_Hant<< Why does the transportation system appeal to these complaints, and why does it go wrong every day, because of the insufficient capacity of the transportation engineer, or for a more fundamental reason?
>>cmn_Hant<< Traffic flow is the study of individual driving and movement of vehicles between the two places, and the interaction between passers-by.
>>cmn_Hant<< The problem is, because it is not 100% predictable of driving habits, it is very difficult to study traffic flow.
>>cmn_Hant<< Fortunately, the driving behavior tends to be within a reasonable consistency range, so there is also a reasonable consistency in the driving trend and can be expressed roughly mathematically.
>>cmn_Hant<< To better represent traffic flow, we define the relationship between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
>>cmn_Hant<< These relationships help plan, design and operate transportation facilities.
>>cmn_Hant<< Insects are the first animals to fly in the air.Their ability to fly allows them to avoid natural enemies more easily and to find food and mates more effectively.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings along their bodies.
>>cmn_Hant<< This gives them more drillable small places to avoid predators.
>>cmn_Hant<< Nowadays, insects that cannot fold their wings are only dragonflies and centipedes.
>>cmn_Hant<< Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some people think he's right, but many people hold the opposite view; they think that the solar system (and even other stars) that includes the Sun is moving around the Earth.
>>cmn_Hant<< That seems reasonable, because the Earth feels like it's not moving, is it?
>>cmn_Hant<< The Amazon is the second longest river on Earth and has the largest amount of water.It has eight times the amount of water in the world's second largest river.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water on Earth that flows into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) long and brings together rivers from thousands of small rivers.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the construction scale of the Giza pyramids and the technical excellence were inaccessible.
>>cmn_Hant<< The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were very surprised by the historical remains left by their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
>>cmn_Hant<< With a population of around 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
>>cmn_Hant<< Both the law of the Vatican and the official texts are in Italian.
>>cmn_Hant<< Italian is also the language commonly used by most of the working population of the country, and Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
>>cmn_Hant<< All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
>>cmn_Hant<< People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, copper since they all existed in nature in their original form, and they used primitive tools to make it relatively simple.
>>cmn_Hant<< The philosopher Aristotle's theory that all things are made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solids, liquids, gases and isotopes, although he also infers that they become new substances to form what we see.
>>cmn_Hant<< The alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
>>cmn_Hant<< There can also be alloys containing a small number of non-metallic elements (e.g. carbon).
>>cmn_Hant<< Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
>>cmn_Hant<< The atoms are incredibly small, small enough to count trillions of atoms to fit into the end of the sentence.
>>cmn_Hant<< As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many when it was just introduced.
>>cmn_Hant<< Unfortunately, with the new way of writing rising, the status and usage of pencils gradually declined.
>>cmn_Hant<< Everyone is now writing messages on their computer screens, no longer using a pencil sharpener.
>>cmn_Hant<< We can only wonder where the keyboard will go when a new invention comes along.
>>cmn_Hant<< The working principle of a nuclear fission bomb is based on the fact that it takes a large amount of energy to merge the masses of polyprotons and neutrons into one atomic nucleus.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart up the mountain.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some atoms are unstable at their core, which means that they are also prone to splitting in the absence of or small thrust.
>>cmn_Hant<< The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust.The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
>>cmn_Hant<< The crust is about 70 km thick at the proximal end and about 100 km thick at the remote end.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is thinner under the moon and thicker under the plateau.
>>cmn_Hant<< There may be more moons and seas at the proximal end due to the thinner crust. This is where the magma floats more easily to the surface.
>>cmn_Hant<< At the heart of content theory is to find out what motivates or attracts them.
>>cmn_Hant<< These theories hold that people have some needs or aspirations that are internalized in the process of growing up as adults.
>>cmn_Hant<< These theories explore what makes certain people want something, and in their environment, what makes them want to do or not do something.
>>cmn_Hant<< Maslow's demand-level theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
>>cmn_Hant<< In general, it is possible for a supervisor to develop two behaviors when he begins to lead former peers, one of which is to attempt to maintain himself as a member of the peer group.
>>cmn_Hant<< This type of manager makes it difficult to make undesirable decisions, execute discipline, performance evaluations, assign scope of responsibility and let subordinates take full responsibility.
>>cmn_Hant<< The other end of the spectrum, on the other hand, transforms into a completely different person, who or she thinks must change all practices the team has been doing and act in their own way.
>>cmn_Hant<< After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
>>cmn_Hant<< This behavior often creates differences between leaders and other team members.
>>cmn_Hant<< Virtual teams must adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with minor differences.
>>cmn_Hant<< Virtual team members are usually contact points of the physical team that directly cooperate.
>>cmn_Hant<< They usually have more autonomy than traditional team members, because their team may work with different time zones for meetings, and their local management hierarchy may not understand this.
>>cmn_Hant<< The well-known "Invisible Management Team" (from Larson and LaFasto's 1989 book, p. 109) is also a unique element that forms a virtual team.
>>cmn_Hant<< The "Invisible Team" is a management team where each member belongs directly to the team and whereby the team sets standards for each member.
Why do organizations want time-consuming processes to build learning institutions?
>>cmn_Hant<< When each functional department within the organization is effectively utilizing all available resources, it can be creative and original.
>>cmn_Hant<< As a result, the process by which organizations work together to overcome barriers can drive innovative processes to meet the needs of their customers.
>>cmn_Hant<< Before an organization has the capacity to innovate, leaders should create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
>>cmn_Hant<< Angel (2006) illustrates the continuous pattern, a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
>>cmn_Hant<< Neurobiological data provides concrete proof of the theoretical methods of cognitive research, so as to narrow the scope of the study and be more precise.
>>cmn_Hant<< The association between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in conducting research.
>>cmn_Hant<< For a long time, people have been aware that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors will all affect behavior and cause certain psychological changes.
>>cmn_Hant<< The invention of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and operating processes that have never been seen before.
>>cmn_Hant<< This provides us with many of the information and materials that create simulation models to help understand the processes in which our mind works.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although artificial intelligence has a strong sci-fi connotation, artificial intelligence forms a branch of computer science that is extremely important to deal with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
>>cmn_Hant<< One of the contents of AI research is the creation of machines that automate the task that need to be performed with intelligent behavior.
>>cmn_Hant<< Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and the ability to identify handwritten texts, voices and faces.
>>cmn_Hant<< These things develop into different disciplines, with a focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
>>cmn_Hant<< AI systems are now commonly used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering and military, and are also built into certain home computers and electric game software.
>>cmn_Hant<< Off-campus teaching is an important part of school education, and many times teachers will want to take their students to places where the bus won't make it.
>>cmn_Hant<< Technology provides virtual off-campus teaching as a solution. Students can sit in the classroom and visit museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art.
>>cmn_Hant<< Sharing off-campus teaching through virtual means is also a great way to review that trip and share experiences with future classes.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, students at Bennett's School in North Carolina design a website each year for their North State Capital Visit Tour, which will be revised every year, but the old version will remain online as a scrapbook.
>>cmn_Hant<< Blogging also helps to improve students' writing ability.Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, this can generally be changed due to the presence of readers.
>>cmn_Hant<< Since students are usually the most discerning readers, bloggers will begin to work to strengthen their writing to avoid criticism.
>>cmn_Hant<< Writing blogs also "forces students to understand the world around them" to satisfy the audience's interest, prompting students to become more intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
>>cmn_Hant<< Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and can encourage students to extend learning far beyond traditional school life.
