We're all hungry.
The boy went through the window.
When do you have to go to sleep?

He drives a truck to Dallas.
Get out of here.
Your letters make me happy.
You didn't die for nothing.

>>cmn_Hant<< That way we'll waste a lot of time.
What are your plans for tomorrow?
You rarely get up this early.
I met a friend of Mary's.
They're eating their apples.
I think you've identified me as someone else.
That's what you think.

I thought it would be interesting.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't know where to put the cane, did you see it?
I'll take my sister to the party.

I bought it last week.
Tom's speech was very good.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is because Japanese and Americans have a different view of politeness.
I have a friend whose father is a teacher.
Wow, it's cold!
We're not a political organization.
How many students are in your school?
