AMs Wales are worried that they will ‘look real'
Some ACs are worried about a suggestion to change their titles in English to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This comes as a result of plans to change the assembly's name in Parliament.
ACs across the political spectrum worry that this could be a shallow text.
AC of the Labour party said that his group was worried because the title was "odd with the words Twp and Pwp."
And to anyone who understands the Greeks: You do not want to be called so-called names.
AM from Plaid Cymru said that the group was on the whole "unhappy" with the suggestion and that they had offered other options.
A Communist Party spokesman said that his group maintained an "open mind" regarding the name change, but suggested that there is not much difference on leverage between MWP and "Muppet".
The controversial ASC translation does not pose so much trouble.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change in name, said: "Of course, a matter for the members themselves will be the final decision on any descriptions to the titles of Assembly Members."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on the proposals. Wide support was seen to call for the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of Assembly Members, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament (ASC) / Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), but MWP came out strongest in the public consultation.
According to the statement, ACs suggest other options, but the work of coming to a consensus could cause a head to the President, Elin Jones. She is expected to introduce draft legislation on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the planning works, including rules on the non-application of ACs and the design of the committee system.
The ACs will have the final debate as to what should be called as they discuss the legislation.
Macedonian people vote in referendum on changing the country's name
The voters will vote Sunday regarding whether the country's name should be changed to "North Macedonia Republic."
This popular vote was drawn in an attempt to resolve a conflict that has lasted decades with Greece, a neighbouring country that has its own state called Macedonia.
Athens has since demanded that the name of its northern neighbours represent a right on its territory. She has opposed the country's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO drones.
Gjorge Ivanov, the President of Macedonia, opposes the country's vote on name change and has said he will dismiss the vote.
However, those who are in favour of the referendum, including the Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, argue that a name change is the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St Martin's Stones in Tewi as Churches in Harlem Face Difficulties
"Historically, there was a bar and a church at every corner, according to the old people I have spoken to," Mr. Adams said.
Today, there's the one of them."
He said that it is possible to understand why the bars have disappeared.
"People are socializing in a different way today", he said.
"For this reason bars are not considered community living rooms where people go regularly."
In regards to churches, he worried that the money obtained by selling assets will not last as long as the leaders expect him to do, "and as long and late, they will be back in the same old situation."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condominia full of the kind of people that will not help the rest of the area's cemeteries.
"The overwhelming majority of the people who buy condominia in these buildings will be white," he said, "which will mean that all these churches will close sooner because it is unlikely that most of these people who move to these condominia will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregants before Harlem became a black metropolis - The Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved from there in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been worshiped nearby became owned by the building.
The church of St. Martin was transferred to a black convent under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a foicot of the resellers on Street 125, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, which refused to hire or lure black people.
The building was scarcely damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's brigade made plans for reconstruction, the boxes were commissioned.
Parishioner David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's church, was pleased to put the name "the keys of the needles" on them.
The expert who sang the boxes in July gave them another name: "Virtual treasure" and "a unique historical offering."
Also, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noted that these were the first boxes in the world to be sung by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to sing the larger boxes at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that the church of St. Martin had no one in its place.
What has happened at St. Martin's church during the last few months has been a complex history of heads and contractors, some of whom have been employed by lay leaders of the church, and some others by the bishop of Esgobol.
The festering - the governing body of the municipality consisting of lay leaders - wrote to the embassy in July to indicate concerns that the embassy would "try to transfer the costs" to the festering, although the festering had not been related to the employment of the headsmen and contractors to whom the embassy had been sent.
Some pilgrims complained that there was a lack of transparency on the part of the embassy.
Shark injured a 13-year-old boy as he bled to look for chemicals in California
According to official workers, a shark attacked a 13-year-old child and injured him Saturday while he was plunging to look for chemicals in California, which was on the first day of the hurricane season.
The attack occurred a little before 7am near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been plunging with his friends for about half an hour Saturday when he heard the boy shouting for help. Then, he nodded to him with a group to help remove him from the water.
Hammel said he believed he was excited when catching a lobster was the boy to begin. But, after reaching the boy, Hammel told him to "look that he shouted, ‘I've been betrayed!
I've been betrayed!'
The bridge of his shoulder was torn open".
I wept on everyone to get out of the water: ‘There's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was lifted from the water in a helicopter and transported to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in serious condition.
We don't know which species of shark was responsible for the attack.
In a brief to the media, the lifesaver, Captain Larry Giles, said that a shark had been seen in the area some weeks earlier, but that she was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles said that the suffering had damaged injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami beach in Ecinitas. That was done for 48 hours for safety and investigation purposes.
Giles said that there are more than 135 shark species in the area but that most of them are not considered dangerous ones.
Sainsbury's plans to reach the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty alternatives in the form of departmental stores that include specialist assistants.
As part of the effort to reach the UK beauty market, a £2.8bn market that is still growing although sales of fashion and goods to the home are lowering, these larger beauty alternatives will be trialled in 11 stores across the country. They will be put in more stores next year if they are successful.
This investment in beauty comes as supermarkets search for ways of using empty shelves after being challenged for television sets, microwaves and goods to the home.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of its beauty goods by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space and the branded areas will be similar to those you would see in stores like Boots.
The monster also relaunches his Boutique pigeon collection so that most products are suited to vegans - something that more and more calls for among young shopkeepers.
In addition, the perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will trial concessions at two of Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The fact that people shop online and move towards buying a little food every day at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain attempts to compete with the Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more services and goods without being food.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since it bought the two chains two years ago. It says that it has boosted food sales and has ensured that acquisitions are more profitable.
Unable to make the previous effort of the architect to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's offered a joint venture with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership ended following a fray as to how to share the revenue of the pharmacy's stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's, three years ago, sold its pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain. The business included 281 stores and was sold for £125m.
He said Lloyds would part of the plan as it would add an extended range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and sense of our beauty skills completely in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained co-workers and they will be there to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an essential beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is thrilled to have Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, was thrilled after the television presenter, Holly Willoughby, pulled out of a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business, in order to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their accessories and goods brand to home.
The pair's business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
Willoughby, one of This Morning's presenters, had given a message on Instagram announcing that she was leaving.
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, is thrilled to have Holly Willoughby pull out of their brand-like business of profitable living at the last minute - to focus on her own major new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "excited" Tuesday when the taxpayer admitted at a meeting at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new agreements - which are worth up to £1.5 million - meant that she did not have enough time anymore for Truly, their accessories and goods brand to home.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and there was mention that it doubled Willoughby's fortunes, an estimated £11 million.
As Willoughby, aged 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's main priorities.
That was her future in the long term and the work she would have done over the next few decades.
Everyone has been surprised at hearing that she has decided to leave.
No one could believe what was happening Tuesday, and it was so close to the launch.
There is a full warehouse of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, and those ready to be sold."
Experts believe that this decision by one of Britain's most bankable stars could cost millions to the company due to a large investment in products, including cushions, candles, clothing and household goods. This could also mean further delays before the launch.
Maybe this will be the end of a long friendship too.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby Truly settled with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
Last night, a source who is friends with Jones said, "We would not comment on his business issues."
She was of course difficult ‘and then we fell in love'
He made fun of the top of the criticism that would get him hired by the news media for making a "narrative" comment, according to some, and for being so positive when talking about the leader from North Korea.
Why has President Trump surrendered so much?
Trump said by watwar news presenters.
"I did not surrender anything."
He said Kim wanted to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting that Trump described as a major step forward to denuclearizing North Korea.
But, the discussions on denuclearization have slowed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, one of North Korea's leading diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not believe that the US is reacting in line with North Korea's early denuclearization movements.
Instead, he said that the US continues to set sanctions that have the goal of maintaining the pressure.
Trump was much more faithless in his big speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had led to positive results - stopping the testing of rockets, helping to release hostages and ensuring that the rest of America's soldiers returned home.
She went on to justify his unusual acting method in regards to talking about the relationship with Kim.
"She's so easy being a presidential candidate, but instead of having 10,000 people standing outside trying to come into this full arena, we'd have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of her.
Tsunami and the Destruction of Indonesia in the Island, by Ladd Hundreds
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental institutions were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, a national disaster was not declared, something necessary to catalyze international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have explained that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children creates a team to travel to Palu, they are not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the land.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman on behalf of the national agency for disasters, said that officials from Indonesia were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be given assistance.
Because the earth is constantly grounded in Indonesia, the tiny country is not willing enough for the disasters of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
It appears that she received no warning about the tsunami in Palu, although a warning has been given, and that has contributed to the number of deaths.
She is difficult to travel between numerous islands of Indonesia at best.
Natural disasters mean that the logistics are even more complex.
A hospital ship that was anchored in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's racist infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent a load of money on roads and railways.
But lack of funds has been a burden on Mr. Joko's administration as he faces reelection next year.
Mr. Joko is also faced with pressure by long-lasting denominational densities in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken up a more liberal form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled on the streets, using machetes, guns and arrows, as well as other antiwar weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of the Liverpool team, scoring an equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge prevented Liverpool from losing a Premiership match to Chelsea with a try in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri and was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal with his team losing from 1-0.
He kicked the ball to his left before shooting towards the farthest post.
The ball rose high above the box as she moved towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally the ball came down for Kepa Arrizabalaga as he jumped and dropped the ball to the net.
"I was trying to go to that position and get hold of the ball and players like Shaq are always playing when that's possible, so I was trying to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and chiciais the ball without thinking too much about it, just going about it."
Half time, Chelsea were winning 1-0 after Eden Hazard, the star from Belgium, scored in the 25th minute.
The shot from Chelsea's team passed the ball with its heel back to Mateo Kovacic that time, before turning away near the centre of the field and sprinting into half Liverpool.
Kovacic gave a quick ‘kick and go' bass in the middle of the field.
Then. he kicked the ball forward competently between the other team's defenders, leading Hazard to the box.
Hazard was earlier than the defender who finished in the net of the farthest post with a kick with his left foot past Alisson Becker, one of Liverpool's players.
Liverpool play against Napoli in a group match at the Premiership at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm Thursday in London.
Total deaths following Indonesia's tsunami rise to 832
The total number of deaths following the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's agency said for disasters early Sunday morning.
It was recorded that many people were stuck in the rubble of buildings that fell when the 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck Friday, an earthquake that caused waves as high as 20 feet, said a spokesman on behalf of the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which includes more than 380,000 people, was covered with the murals of buildings that were demolished.
The police arrested a man, aged 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
An investigation into a murder has been launched after a woman's body was found in Penbedw, Deeside, today morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found to have been tried on Grayson Mews on John Street for 7.55am and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area to inform if they heard or saw anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘Although the investigation has only just begun, I will ask anyone who was in the John Street area in Penbedw to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
Also, if anyone, especially taxi drivers, have caught anything on dashboard cameras, they should contact us from fear that they have information that is essential to our investigation".
A spokesperson on behalf of the police has confirmed that the woman whose body was found came from the Penbedw area and that her body was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman has arrived at the site to ask questions about where she was found fore today.
The investigations continue and the police say they are informing her of the victim's closest relationship.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment but the police have told him that no one gets in or out of the building.
He had no words when he heard it happened.
The president now gets to know that they'll have to wait some hours before getting back in.
One of the police officers was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime site.
A woman reached the site in her tears.
She still repeats ‘this is so terrible'.
At 2pm there were two police vans in the cordon and there was another van outside of it.
A number of officers standing in the cordon monitored the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 indicating a 247 entry 30 September.
Cromwell's statue outside Parliament is the latest memorial to be part of the ‘revamped history' fray
Getting rid of the statue would be a bargaining justice for the impending destruction that caused to as many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, a destruction made by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society said that Mr Crick's suggestion is one "truths" that "try to revamp history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "She was unavoidable, in the present discussion regarding the removal of statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromell outside St. Stephen's Palace would be targeted.
Cromwell was not responsible for the accomplishment or command of the iconoclasty of England's civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent portrait of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th-century view and is part of the historicity of a figure which many people believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "A number of people, more in the 19th century than today possibly, consider Cromwell a figure who did protect the senate from external pressure, which is the kingship in his case.
I don't know whether that's absolutely true or not and that's an ongoing historical discussion.
What is certain is that the resistance in the mid-17th century had subsequently navigated the development of our country and Cromwell is a single well-known figure representing one side of the issue.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worth their celebration and commemoration."
Rheibus Pig Kills Farmer from China
A mosque attacked a fencer and killed him in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
South China Morning Post said Sunday that a man, who was known according to his surname ‘Yuan', had been found dead near a pig tulk in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province. His arteries had broken and he was blooded over.
A pig fencer was preparing to spray sandwiches on a cheek farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to the mention, he had travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Tunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The following morning. his cousin found him dead and noticed that a nearby pig's tuck door was open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the tulk and that there was blood on his mouth.
A forensic survey confirmed that the 550 pound pig had torn the fencer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs had been torn and they were all blood," said the cousin, who was called by his surname, "Wu", according to a quote in the Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera video showed Yuan reaching the market for 4.40am Thursday to feed his cheek.
His body was found about an hour later.
Neither Yuan nor his cousin were the guns of the animal that killed the man.
One of the market managers told the Evening News that the mosque had been locked in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the site.
According to the mention, Yuan's family and market authorities are discussing compensation for his death.
Although there are not many of them, there are other records of cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a mosque attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, severely injuring the man.
Ten years later, a 650 pound pig caught a charge of impunity against his tractor until his wife devoured the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his cheek in 2012, one of Manitoba's farmers told CBC News that a pig is not normally aggressive but that blood taste can cause them to behave so.
"They were being cautious.
Young are they, very curious...they do not intend to hurt you.
You have to give them enough respect," he said.
Rosa coral reefs cause heavy rain over a vast area of the southwest US
According to the forecast, Rosa's Hurricane weakened as it moved over the colder waters of Mexico's west coast.
However, Rosa's hurricane will cause heavy rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Rosa had 85 mph winds, a Category 1 hurricane, from 5am ahead of Eastern time on Sunday. The hurricane was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and it moves east towards the Western Coast of the U.S. As Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, the coral will begin to push a deep tropical humidity around the north to southwest U.S..
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches of hand to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity will resonate with the trough approaching causing heavy rain over the southwest during the next few days.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of hand will cause major dangerous flooding, a flow of rubble and possible landslides in the wilderness.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates between 2 and 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected as much as between 2 and 4 inches in hand in parts of the southeast, especially over much of Arizona.
It is possible that major flooding with the conditions will worsen rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It would be very annoying to venture out into the wilderness on foot with a threat of a troubling hand.
Heavy rain could cause the culverts to become wild rivers and a storm of fells and tartans will cause strong winds and blows of dust in the area.
The approaching trough will cause some local heavy hand in parts of coastal Southern California.
It is possible that a total of more than half an inch of hand will fall, which could result in a small flow of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the area's first rainfall during its wet season.
A few scattered tropical cyclones will begin reaching Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads more late Monday night and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will last throughout Wednesday.
The temperature will change dramatically throughout the US during October as the Arctic cools, but the turnstiles will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in the temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic changes in temperature through the middle of the US Sunday.
There is nearly 20 degrees of difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, what remains of the summer warmth will try to rise and expand again.
A large portion of central and eastern U.S.A. is expected to have a warm start to October with the temperature in the 80s from the Southern Hemisphere to parts of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long term climate forecasts show a high chance for higher temperatures than average for eastern US throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million watch Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually harassing her in the 1980s, give testimony, and that on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political disagreement continued, with broadcasters advising on normal programs to broadcast the unexpected turn obtained Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator, Jeff Flake, indicated that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was completely convinced that Kavanaugh had touched in her apprehension and tried to pull her clothes off at a party in high school, and was drunk.
Kavanaugh said in giving his testimony that it was absolutely certain that that did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company calculated the average number of audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.
To give a perspective, the size of this audience was similar to an audience that would watch a football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, which the channel's opinion hosts have given strong support to appointing Kavanaugh, was leading all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 viewers, NSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
Much interest followed the hearing too.
Flake was the foremost figure in the drama Friday.
After the moderate Republicans office declared that it would vote from Kavanaugh's party, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning with protesters shouting at him as he tried to get into a lift to the Judgement Committee hearing.
He was standing looking around the floor for some minutes as he got a head curtain, live on television on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he said the truth to the country?
He was told, "you have the power and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the lift closed, that he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all filmed live hours later, when it became time for the Judiciary Committee to vote to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination and have a vote in the full Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the claims against the nominees by the following week, a result which minority Democrats have been urging.
Flake was partially prosecuted after chatting with his friend, the Democratic Senator, Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and many other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was a powerful one, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh.
British MP May accuse judges of ‘playing politics' in Brexit case
In an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, the Prime Minister, Theresa May, accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union saying they "play politics" with the future of Britain and fuel the national benefit.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Bilateral Conference in Birmingham, Britain, 29 September 2018.
In another interview besides her interviewing her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, criticised what she called a Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that she "would laugh" at a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs.
Wayde Sims shooting case: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of killing one of LSU's players
The police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and will go to prison on suspicion of secondary murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the feud.
The police found the glasses on the site and said they had found Simpson's DNA on her, the CBS receiving WAFB reports.
After Simpson questioned, police said he had admitted he shot Wayde and killed him.
He has a $350,000 medal, the Advocate said.
The East Baton Rouge Police Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday, saying that a gun blow to the head into the neck is the cause of the death.
The department praised the task force of the Louisiana State Police, the state's police crime lab, the University of the South police and the citizens of the area for helping in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the area's law enforcement team for its "difficulty and work to ensure justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot and six-inch forward was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Fore Friday, LSU basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the team had "broken their hearts" and that they "were alarmed" after hearing about Wayde's death.
This is the kind of thing you're worried about all the time.
Burner caches ashes for Mexico City
A leak that cached of Popocatepetl oysters has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Prevention of Threats had warned the people of Mexico on Saturday not to approach the burnout after the activity increased in the quadrant and 183 gas and leak emissions were registered over 24 hours.
The centre monitored a number of settlements and settlements.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ashes covering front windows found in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the intensity of the burnout which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-southeast of the capital, and that since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The teenager is called "Don Goyo" and has been alive since 1994.
The police conflicted with Catalan dissidents before celebrating a year since the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two protesters in favour of independence clashed with the anti-terrorist police and as thousands joined competing opposition to mark a year since Catalonia's divided vote on discrimination.
A group of people in masks who were in favour of discrimination bled the anti-depressant police who held them back with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be crowded by tourists.
There were also later resistances during the day, with the police using their batons to control the battleships.
Over many hours, groups of independence parties shouted "No forgetting, no forgiving" and unionist protesters shouted "There's to Spain."
14 people were treated for minor injuries they received at the protests, according to the local press.
The tensions are still high in this area which has its moment on independence, and that is a year after the 1 October referendum in which Madrid considered it illegal but which was celebrated by Catalans who are dissidents.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose to become independent, but many people did not come to vote and those against discrimination had significantly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to halt the blast at police stations throughout the region in violent confrontations.
Groups of independence parties camped Friday night to prevent opposition from the national police party.
The resistance went ahead but was forced to follow another trail.
According to Narcis Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who was going to protest the discriminations with his wife, he was not faithless regarding having independence for Catalonia anymore.
"Last year, we got one of the best times ever.
I watched my parents cry by happiness at being able to vote but we are back in the same old situation now," he said.
Although they managed to achieve a small but vital victory in the regional elections in December last year, groups that are in favour of independence have found it difficult to maintain the momentum to go this year and many of their most well-known leaders have either outlived themselves or waited for a trial for helping to organize the referendum and declare independence thereafter.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on her phone to support the police, the politicians on both sides had been escorting the waters during the riot.
The wrongdoing is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail before trial since the end of last year, announced that he would be applying in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way of condemning the recession in democratic values and the blues we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car is driven into house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, have been arrested after a car was driven many times into a house in Londonderry.
This occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage was done to the gates and to the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot to the car some head.
Menga's shot ensured a 1-0 victory to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal over Livingston secures victory for Livingston
Livingston stunned the Rangers causing Steven Gerrard to lose for the second time in 18 games as Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's shot was the difference as teammate Gary Holt rose to Hibernian level in a moment.
Gerrard's team have not won an away game in the Super League this season and they faced Hearts next Saturday, who are at the top and eight points ahead of them.
Prior to that, the Rangers will hold a match against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has beaten six games in a row in the sub-section, and the head coach, Holt, has not lost a game since he traded Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have been on the front long before they scored and their direct nature caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but dragged his effort across the face of the catch, then Alan Lithgow could only analyze his effort widely after slipping to meet Craig Halkett's header across the catch,
The home team was willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause difficulties for the others in certain places.
And that's how got the overall catch.
The Rangers granted a free kick and Livingston worked to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperating to help Menga, who kicked the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
By then, the Rangers controlled possession on the ball but were unable to break through the home team's defenders and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, did not worry some much.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected at the feet of Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goaltender, and Lithgow kicked the ball wide from another play set by Livingston.
Crossovers were brought to Livingston's box continuously and they continued to be cleared, and two rights to a penalty kick - after Halkett challenged the player delegate, Glenn Middleton, and one for a hand ball - were disqualified.
‘A wonderful performance' by Livingston -
Alasdair Lamont, one of BBC Scotland's presenters at Tony Macaroni's Arena
A wonderful performance and result for Livingston.
They were great and they continue to raise the expectations on this ascending path.
The style of their play and personnel has not changed greatly since they reached the top, but Holt must be praised for the way he has motivated the team since he arrived.
He had as many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, managing an extremely organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the fronts of their feet throughout the game.
But, the Rangers did not have much inspiration.
Although they had played well at times under Gerrard's control, the standards of those were not to be seen.
They had a big deal on their last ball - only once did they open the home side - and it was quite a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Mixed welcome to Erdogan in Cologne
She was air blue and everyone smiled Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's disastrous visit to Germany – a visit to try to improve the relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreed over issues including human rights, freedom in the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police had given security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from collapsing in front of the mosque, but enough supporters had come beside the mosque to see their scene.
Hundreds of protesters who were against Erdogan – many of them Kurdish – made sure their voices were heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
These match-fixing protests reflect the tear associated with the visitor, a man who is considered a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocracy by others.
Car accident in Deptford: Biker dies in collision with car
A biker has died in collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and came parachuting, but the man died at the site.
The accident has occurred some months after another mechanic died in a ‘taro and flee' accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his closest relative.
Road closure arrangements and diversions have been placed and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers have been injured in a chase
Six officers have been injured in a chase at a high security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The chase took place in Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison at approximately 9:30 BST on Sunday and the case continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been called there to deal with the chase, which consists of eight prisoners and takes place in only one aden.
The fire triggered injuries that the officers had on their faces at the site.
A spokesperson on behalf of the Prison Service said: "The staff of prisons with specialist training have gone there to deal with this incident that continues in Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the staff have been given treatment for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and they could spend more time in prison."
Her Majesty's Prison Long Lartin consists of more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June the governor of the prison was said to have been treated at the hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
And in October last year, anti-terror officers were called to prison to deal with a serious chase where the staff were attacked with powder balls.
Rosa's Hurricane at Big Flood Bygwth in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Ellwa Dry Areas)
Tropical low pressure is a rare thing in Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen beginning next week as the rest of Hurricane Rosa travels across the Southwest of the Desert, causing a danger of major flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will keep sight of major flooding Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday, turning into a handover late Monday night.
In a message on Twitter, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained storm status or low pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of AZ boundaries."
The latest models of the National Center on Earthquakes predict between 2 and 4 inches in hand, with a few rare examples of a total of up to 6 inches on the Arizona Mogollon Edge.
Other areas in the Southwest of the Desert including the Great Basin and Rockies of the center are likely to have between 1 and 2 inches, with a few cases of total up to 4 inches possible.
For those who are not in danger of having a major flood, Rosa's rains can be of benefit to them as they live in a dry area.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, it is likely that some of this rain will be beneficial because there are currently dry conditions in the Southwest.
According to the U.S. Dryness Monitor, a little over 40% of Arizona experiences extreme drought at least, the highest category but one," he told weather.com.
To begin, Rosa's route will lead to land along the Baja California, Mexico peninsula.
Rosa, which was still as strong as a Sunday morning hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving northwards by traveling 12 miles per hour.
The storm reached the colder waters of the Pacific so she weakened.
Because of this, the hurricane is expected to reach the land in Mexico on a tropical storm strength Monday afternoon or Monday night.
The rain could be heavy over parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
"We expect a total of 3 to 6 inches of hand from Baja California into northwest Sonora, with a potential of up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a low pressure storm, which will then travel up through Arizona and into southern Utah arriving late Tuesday night.
"The main danger that is to be expected in Rosa's skills or the remnants of the coral is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and Southwest US wilderness," said the National Center on Hurricanes.
This rain is expected to create a large flood that can risk life as well as a flow of rubble in the wilderness and landslides on mountainous land.
Attacking Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys a teenager and one 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found to have been tried in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, and that was at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital and continues to be there in a "fixed" state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The officials have asked anyone who has material on their mobile phone of what happened to present that evidence.
Trump says Kavanaugh had ‘disappointed of aggression and anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to combat the deceptive and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "died of aggression and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the Congress Thursday and was under a feeling at the waning of Christine Blasey Ford's conviction that claimed he had sexually abused her decades ago, and both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
The President said Saturday that "the people of America have seen greatness and standard and courage" Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal workers of our era, a legislator with an enhanced history of public service," he told the crowd of supporters in Northern Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as talking about the importance of the Republican assembly in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks are to go until one of the most important elections of our era.
I'm not applying, but I'm applying real," he said.
"That's why I'm going to everywhere try to struggle over brilliant candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is to "protect and prevent."
The first key legislative debate on the Senate floor regarding Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to occur Friday at the latest, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds are killed by Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number increases
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom had been evacuated away as huge waves broke on the beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had assembled for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves struck as high as six meters on the beach fin night, sweeping many from there and killing them and damaging anything along the route.
The tsunami came following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the warning about the tsunami was received yesterday, people carried on with their activities on the beach, they did not run from there immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman on behalf of Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, BNPB, at a briefing meeting in Jakarta.
The tsunami was not alone, it was dragging cars, trunks, houses, it was hitting against everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 cya (497 mph) before hitting the beach's edge.
Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survive.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos of the air published by the disasters agency showed that many buildings and shops had been damaged, bridges had fallen and a mosque surrounded by water.
Backfires were still shaking the coastal city Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area that contained 2.4 million people.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by Friday's highly anticipated earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have zoomed the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as one "healthy" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings that had fallen, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and that 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and the number of people injured could be greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coast north of Palu, an area called Donggata, which is closer to the summit of the earthquake.
"There was no way of communicating with Donggala to get information", Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,00 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the areas on which they were affected.
"This is a disaster already, but the situation could worsen", he said.
The agency was harshly criticized Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had struck Palu, although the officials said the waves had arrived in the time the warning was announced.
In an amateur film shared on social media you can hear a man on a high down yelling at people in the street below by warning them that there is a tsunami on his way.
Within minutes there was a mound of water hitting the shore, carrying buildings and cars from there.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large electric dash which turned off the communications around Palu making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but those who have had to leave their homes are really in need of food and other essentials.
The city's airport has been reopened only for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was supposed to go to the rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
Over 800 Killed in Indonesia's Tsunami Skill.
She's a Fearless Stand.
Although the World Vision staff from Donggala had arrived in the city of Palu safely, where the workers have sheltered in tarpaulin shadows which are set in the yard of their office, they passed torch sights on the road, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen many houses have been destroyed," he said.
Things are very bad.
Even as aid groups approach to begin the deteriorating process of giving emergency aid, some have complained that specialist foreign aid workers have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, no funding, supplies or staff can be provided unless the site of the disaster has been declared as a national disaster domain.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at a provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman on behalf of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, "just, this is a national disaster," we can get international aid, but there is no status yet."
As she nods at Palu for the second time following the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hoped that their loved ones were alive through some miracle, which would spread some on the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a small boy was removed from a garbage bin.
On Sunday, rescuers managed to free a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body at her disposal.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesia national paragliding team, had coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier in the month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said that his disciples are among those others who are stuck in the Roa Roa hotel.
"As someone with experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
During the hours after the paragliding community heard about the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, Mr. Gendon said he had sent a host of WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
But there was only one grey tick beside his messages, rather than two blue dikes.
"I think that means the messages have not been sent," he said.
Thieves bear $26,750 as ATM engine refuels in Newport on the Levee
Fore Friday thieves stole $26,750 from one of Brink's employees who was refilling an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news statement by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM engine in the entertainment building, preparing to provide more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
When he was busy, another man "run from behind the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be provided.
Witnesses saw many others fleeing from the site, according to the statement, but police did not indicate the number was part of the incident.
Anyone with information on who these people are should contact Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapist changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
When announcing the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The one that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, aged 41, has been called Ye since and used the name as a title for his eighth album, published in June.
The change comes before he appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his New Album, Yandhi.
He goes on the show in place of Ariana Grande, the singer from America who made a comeback due to "emotional reasons", said the many who created the show.
In addition to being a pupil of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has religious significance to him.
"I think ‘ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you", West forgives earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with Big Boy, which he presents on the radio.
"So I'm thee, I'm ours, we're this.
The name of Kanye, which means the only one, went to Ye alone – reflecting the good, the evil and the confusion, everything.
The album does more than reflect who we are."
It is among many other famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has had various names like Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to cooperate with West, has also been using his name by varying it in terms of the heifer and the capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use troops against citizens
Mexico's President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use troops against citizens as the country celebrates 50 years since the bloody revenge against students.
On Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised "to never use the military to defeat the people of Mexico."
Soldiers shot during a peaceful counter-offensive on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, and that's when the student masses of the left wing were rooted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young people of Mexico by giving assistance to those studying and opening more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities meant that young people were attracted to crime gangs.
US should double its funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, U.S. should double the money that she spends on research work in the field, said the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made publications regarding artificial understanding, although U.S. does not generally have a formal artificial understanding strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year, which is its goal of being the best country in contact with all innovations by 2030.
"The double assurance of the funding for research work in the field of artificial understanding would be a good start, considering that all the other countries are much less developed than the US, and we are looking for the next discovery in the field of artificial understanding," Lee said.
To double the mean funding could double the opportunity to ensure that the next major accomplishment in the field of artificial understanding is achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee has published his book "Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most advanced artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he was working on an artificial understanding system that beat the best Othello player in America. He later became an executive officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions as a Robotics Challenge of Advanced Research Projects in the field of Defense, and asked when would be the next time to help identify the next visuals.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win grants from the government, Lee said.
"Not China who steals the academic leaders; but the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently sought to hire brilliant graduates from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Also, Lee said that changes to the migration policy could help U.S. to revive its efforts in the field of artificial understanding.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to people with disabilities in artificial intelligence," he said.
China's Council of State announced its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The China National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government institutions give funds to researchers from the US, but the standard of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center, which is supposed to include partners from the industry and from the academic world, and the White House announced that a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence is being formed.
And this month DARPA issued an investment in a venture called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research work on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been active for months.
Macedonian citizens vote in referendum on changing the country's era
Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday regarding whether to change the country's name to "North Macedonia Republic", which would resolve a conflict that has lasted decades with Greece, which had prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a state called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours represents a right on its territory and has prevented the country from becoming part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would fuel the identity of Macedonia's largest Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a campaign to foicing has cast doubts as to whether the number of voters will meet the 50 percent target needed to validate the referendum.
This is the plenary question of the referendum: "Are you in favour of becoming a member of NATO and the EU and accepting the agreement with Greece."
Those in favour of changing the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order for Macedonia, one of the only countries to develop after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to have access to bodies like the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote over the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because that ensures more secure lives For all of us," said Georgijevska, aged 79, in Skopje.
Although they are not legally bound, enough members of parliament have said that they will expect the result of the vote to make it a decisive vote.
To change the name a majority of two parts of three would have to be in parliament.
The state elections commission said there was no mention of any irregularities by 1pm.
However, only 16 percent did vote, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 percent of voters who had registered did vote.
I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," Gjose Tanevski, aged 62, a policeman in the capital, Skopje, said.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, a change that would mean that the country could join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the orphanage in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small platform and laying chairs in front of tents that were set by those who will boycott the auditorium.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join by being able to hold our head high, not through the servants' door" Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that becoming a member of NATO will ensure a budget whose true need is Macedonia, a country whose unemployment rate is higher than 20 percent.
I think that will be the vast majority of parties because more than 80 percent of our citizens are from the EU and NATO parties," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that the result of "yes" would "confirm our future."
According to a poll set up last Monday by the Macedonian Organisation for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - which is below the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 percent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, that would be the first serious blow to the policy of the government that is in favour of the West since she took the lead in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, pass all Brighton defenders and catch
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crashed Brighton defenders during Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero did so looking awfully easy as he scored in 65th minute.
The blower from Argentina got a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders, before reaching the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
One defender pushed away before running sooner than many others at the edge of Brighton's box.
He then gave a pass to his left, giving Sterling the ball.
The forward from England used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right ankle to beat Brighton's goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan, with a blow to the right side of the net.
Aguero is having some problems with his feet," Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, told the reporters.
"We had discussed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he had scored a try at that time."
But Sterling gave Chelsea the first advantage in the Major League game.
That catch came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton territory that time.
He gave a lovely kick through the players along the backyard to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times before guiding Sterling about the farthest post.
Chelsea's forward kicked the ball to the net before sliding over the boundaries.
Manchester City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League play-off group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer for playing against the Rockies
Since the Nationals have no hope of competing in the second opportunity games, there is not much reason for overtaking another starter.
But Scherzer hopes to stand on the Sunday bump to face the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are prospects in terms of second opportunity games for the Rockies, who save the front on the Los Angeles Dodgers from one game in the NL West championship.
The Rockies scored at least a second opportunity with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals Friday night, but they still hope to secure their place in the first group.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can foot the rubber knowing that there will be a good atmosphere here with the crowd in Denver and that the other team will play at the top level that I'd face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in a game so?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but according to the mention they wanted to let Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start for the 34th time, had a Thursday practice session and would throw on his usual Sunday rest day.
The right hand thrower who plays for Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 ‘strikeout' shots in 220 2/3 batters this season.
Trump rallying in Northern Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation related to his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and in them spoke about the importance of the Republic's assembly in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be in the autumn of November.
Five weeks are to go until one of the most important elections of our era.
This is one of the big, big ones – I'm not applying but I'm applying real, that's why I travel to every place struggling over brilliant candidates," he said.
Trump went ahead, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group here, you see this happening now.
And they're determined to take the power back by using any means you need, you see the aggression, the malaise.
They have no regrets about who gets hurt, who they have to saturate on to get power and control, they want to get power and control, we're not going to give that to them."
The Democrats, he said, are trying to "protect and prevent."
"And we've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats a "flinish and chasm and invincible and valiant."
He referred to the name of the high-ranking Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein of the Parliamentary Judiciary Committee, and a loud buzz was heard among the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you share the document?
The, the, what.
No, the no, wait a moment - that was an example of bad body language - the worse body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad-based party.
The party does not tolerate those who say they are.
When the active members of Momentum in my local party voted to call me, that was very much a surprise.
After all, I am the latest of many Labour MPs to have heard that there is no welcome for us - and that's about saying our say.
My senior co-worker, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way because she stands determined against anti-semitism.
In my case, the offer of a juror begged me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ignoring it about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe. Ironically, these are issues similar to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in their circle.
The announcement for the East Nottingham Labour meeting on Friday indicated "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the GC meetings Friday night have been so meetings.
Unfortunately, that's not a tone so that's in most meetings nowadays and we've old forgotten about the promise of "more kind, more tender" politics, whether or not we ever got that.
It has become increasingly clear that different viewpoints are not tolerated in the Labour party and all viewpoints are criticized on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Co-workers whom I used to think were of the same political annoyance as I started expecting me to make a decent turn and support perspectives that I would never have agreed with – whether that was on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I'll speak publicly - and there's no difference what I'll actually say - it will lead to harsh attacks on social media calling for my non-election, condemning the politics of the centre, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And not just me who has experienced this.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my fellow workers because the comments that are attributed to me tend to be political ones.
I admire the professional and determined nature of those co-workers who face a lot of sexual or racial abuse every day but who don't let that get the best at them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is the way in which levels of abuse have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are not such a broad-minded party now and with all offers of "definite confidence" or a change to the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow.
I've had a lot of advice during the last two years encouraging me to keep my head down, not to express my fate too much, then I'd be "just."
But that's not why I've chosen to be a politician.
I joined Labour as a school pupil 32 years ago, troubled by the neglect of the Thatcher government, a government that was responsible for the breakcalonous state of my constituent school's classroom. Since then I have tried to promote better public services for those most in need – whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never concealed my politics, nor in the last election before.
No one in East Nottingham would have been able to misunderstand my political viewpoints and the fields in which I disagreed in their circle with the current leadership.
To those who did promote the proposal on Friday, all I have to say is that I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour party with the country moving towards Brexit which will be a blow to hearers, to businesses and to our public services.
But, in fact, not a message to the Nottingham Momentum that I have, but a message to my electorate, are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no number of threats of my non-election or political convenience will prevent me from acting in the way I believe is best for you all.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Father digs at the top
Two late attempts may have spawned some at the final result, but it is certain that Ayr deserved to win this Tennent Grand Final game.
They are now at the top of the table, the only team that has not beaten them from the ten.
Finally, their outstanding defensive work, as well as their work of taking advantage of opportunities, was responsible for the home team's support and the coach, Peter Murchie, had every right to be proud.
We've had challenging games so far, but nobody has beaten us, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr must be praised, they took advantage of better opportunities than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, which was converted by Frazier Climo, ensured Ayr was ahead. But the yellow card that got Scotland's cap, Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, meant that Melrose was able to take advantage of that and Jason Baggott picked up an unconverted try.
Climo ensured that Ayr were never more ahead with a penalty kick, before he, before exactly half time, scored and converted an individual try to secure a score of 17-5 for Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, which was converted by Baggott, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a bit of a delay because Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured, and was carried away on a stretcher. After they resumed, Ayr got more success following a request from Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Then Ayr's temporary captain, Blair Macpherson, got a yellow card, and again, Melrose made the extra player pay with an unconverted try from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty kick line, MacPherson put the ball down behind Ayr's advanced skirmishes.
Climo converted the try, as he did again almost immediately after a restart, after Kyle Rowe collected a David Armstrong kick and sent forward Gregor Henry away from the fifth try of the home team.
Star Still Game is looking for a new career in the dining industry
Ford Kieran, one of Still Game's stars, hopes to move to the hospitality industry after he finds that he has been named director of a licensed dining company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC popular show, along with writing and acting in conjunction with his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The poem has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last series in the show's history and Kiernan probably plans for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to make a comment on the story, but one of Scottish Sun's sources suggested that Kiernan was hoping to be part of Glasgow's "funny dining restaurant."
‘No sea guns': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Marines patrolled the maritime headquarters of a rigging cladding in La Paz.
Public buildings wave blue flag like the sea.
Maritime centers from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the signposts: "We have sea guns by right.
Its restoration is a duty."
Bolivia is surrounded and the reminder of the fort that was lost to Chile in bloody resistance over resources in the 19th century is still alive - in the same way as the desire for sailing the Pacific again.
These hopes are amicable than they have been for decades, as Bolivia waited for a verdict by the international justice court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has a momentum, a sense of unity and silence, and as reason she is faithless in waiting for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat from Bolivia.
A number of Bolivian citizens will watch the international justice court's verdict on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribune in the Hag will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim - after decades of spontaneous conversations - that Chile must discuss giving Bolivia an openness to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic president who is a native of Bolivia - who faces a legitimate battle for re-election next year - relies largely on the verdict Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some dissenters believe that the court is not likely to decide in favour of Bolivia - and many would not change if the court did so.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to seize Chilean territory, and has demanded that it not determine the outcome of possible clashes.
The fact that the international justice court's verdict came only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests "that the case was not a complex one," said Paz Zárate, a husband from Chile who specializes in international law.
And instead of improving Bolivia's cause, it is possible that the last four years have worsened the cause.
"The current administration of Bolivia has been appalled at this matter related to having access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales's warlike rhetoric has fueled any good will that Chile had after, he suggested.
Sometime, Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged court martials since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hag, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was usually a quick process.
On Monday Bolivia will have "an exceptional opportunity to start a new period of ties with Chile" and an opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of conflict over reciprocal benefits," he said.
Also, Calzadilla denied that Marales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the mayoral matter as a political badge.
"Bolivia will never surrender its right to access the Pacific," he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says it will not remove its nuclear weapons unless it can trust US
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons unless the trusted member of Washington first.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to stick to the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the countries' leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appeared so that he was about to resume a nuclear diplomacy that he would not be able to reach an agreement, and that more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri states that the idea that continuing sanctions and U.S. opposition to declare an end to the Korean War will only make the North surrender.
Washington barred from agreeing with the statement before Pyongyang made significant disarmament moves first.
Kim and the President of the US, Donald Trump, want to get a second summit.
But there is much doubt as to whether Pyongyang is seriously concerned about the surrender of weapons which the country, most likely, considers as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the latest collection of huge headwear is about to reach your High Street
If you want another hat or if you want to stop the sun completely, this is the fashion for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a variety of huge and striking benches for their SS19 collection on the fashion platform, which were shining on the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very inexpensive hats have appeared on Instagram this summer and the outstanding creations of these designers have been featured on the fashion platform.
One of Valentino's striking items was a leather hat over the top of a loft decorated with a plucked wide edge covering the tops of the models.
Among the other great accessories were water melons decorated with games, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple - but these hats would not warm your head.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of strange masks- and that's in good time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had lips sewn together and they were biased to Hannibal Lecter than to arbitrarily grind.
One of them was similar to a scuba-ball uniform with snorcel and goggles, and another looked like a ia cream cone, which had melted.
And, if you enjoy great fashion statements- this is your chance.
Those who keep sight of style predict that huge bonnets could reach your big street.
These large hats follow the style of ‘La Bomba', the popular straw hats with the wide edge two feet, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The culinary label behind these unconventional hats featured on social media also had another large creation on the fashion platform - a straw bag almost as large as the model in a swimsuit that carried it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with a raffia edge and a white leather handle, was one of the most striking items in the La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see large beach hats and bags reach the big street the next summer - as the designer has made so much impression, it would be difficult to avoid the call for big accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools hold a good reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the examinations, and that is only attained by individual success and in conjunction in the fields of sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, these schools, which are represented by the Independent Schools Council of Scotland (SCIS), seek to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their pupils for further education and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a mainstream school curriculum, I see modern languages are still popular subjects that are selected in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, that will stay in his memory.
If you talk to someone in his own language, that'll stay in the heart."
This is a powerful message to remind us that we can only rely on the English language when trying to develop connections and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the results of this year’s exams recently, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables and contain the highest passing rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages have achieved a high A grade.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are a member of SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students had an A High grade in Mandarin, and that 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish had an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Now languages, like subjects, are treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that a lack of linguistic skills was responsible for 17 percent of the reasons employers could not fill vacant positions.
Therefore, there is more to call for languages in order to prepare young people for their careers into the future.
With more affordable job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a global environment.
No matter what career someone chooses, if that individual has learned a second language, he will have an actual future advantage of having such long-term skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people in other countries will mean that a bilingual person will step forward immediately.
According to a poll by YouGov which included more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 73 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. In addition, French was the only language spoken by a double figure percentage, which was 15 percent.
This is the reason that investing in teaching languages is important for children today.
The ability of many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children a better opportunity to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages that they will teach.
A number of schools will focus on classical modern languages, but other schools will teach languages that are considered the most important ones for the UK when looking around 2020, like Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages that he can choose from in independent schools, and the schools will include teaching staff who specialise in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of who is ahead of them.
It cannot be denied at present, in a global business environment, that languages are still universal to the future of the country, so that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will still offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien to be watched.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron plays his first game for the Sunday Lakers in San Diego
The stay is almost on top for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play in the opening game of the series before the start of the Sunday season receiving the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided for how many minutes he'll play again.
"It will be more than one but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers' supervisor, Mike Trudell, gave a message on Twitter saying that it is likely that James will play a few minutes.
After a practice session earlier in the week, James was questioned about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"In this period in my career I don't need games before the season in order to prepare," he said.
West Virginia Trump Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump begins a series of campaigning rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including visits and friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice for the Supreme Court postponed, Trump seeks to enlist support for the mid-term elections as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When is there a Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump's rally is in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch a Trump rally in West Virginia online below using a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the hearings this week for his nomination to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which is under stress as a result of claims of sexual misconduct with the plea to be confirmed in the sentencing postponed for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans facing hard elections in November to gain a few momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that the five rallies over the next week would prompt "surprising volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and add to the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of the Congress is so important to its agenda that the President will be able to travel to as many states as possible as possible as to or start the important campaign season," a spokesperson from the Trump campaign, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Being held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring fans of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get noticed by Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second work for Trump to visit West Virginia in the last month, a reign that he won from more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senatorial candidate to West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the pinion polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come here to try to boost him in the pinion poles," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows the pluck to battle ahead when going to individual games Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, a Saturday afternoon quartet could be the exact thing this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum pendulum is a concept that has been imagined in the gaming world but it is a concept in which the players believe in it especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the momentum is at the moment?
"They were at the front of six points and now it's four, so we have a little momentum for me," Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the plain with another edgy to play.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in their mood and they have enough to encourage them , especially by Speith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and got three points out of four each.
Speith has been excellent from thee to the grain and he leads by example.
The screams of celebration went higher as his round went ahead, managed with a vital pitch to go on a gem to four each although he and Thomas had been down two after two.
There was a similar scream after the pyt that won the game for them on the 15, the kind of scream that tells you that he doesn't believe America is out of it yet.
"You have to focus and worry about your own gem," said Speith.
This is the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to create an impression.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the untimely story of the Ryder Cup.
An odd but fond European couple has four for four and they can do nothing wrong."
"Moliwood" was the only bar not to have Saturday afternoon bogies, and they had no Saturday morning bogies, Friday afternoons or the last nine Friday mornings work.
That run, and a way in which the energy flows between them and the crowd confirms that they are the players to beat them Sunday, would be the same player more popular to confirm Europe's victory as their right of way over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible both on the same brass on different holes.
But, it's an early rush to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson beat Sergio Garcia, the hero of four balls a morning, easily when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Following bogies and two doubles in the first nine the Spaniard and Swede were in a hole which they came not close to climbing out of it.
But on Sunday there's nobody to help you out of your hole.
There are four payloads and the interesting mod fours to watch because of the relationships between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
So far Europe has played better as a team and they lead from a bit at the beginning of last day, but the fours session has proved that Team USA had the ability to struggle, something some especially in the US suspected.
Europe ahead of 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a significant advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing four-ball games and four-ball Saturdays 10-6 ahead of the US.
An amazing duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two victories over Tiger Woods to go and score them so far in Le Golf National to four points.
European driver Thomas Bjorn, who attempted to regain the trophy after his loss at Hazeltine two years ago, doomed the poor American garrison in four balls a morning by going and the series to 3-1.
The U.S. gave more resistance in the fourties, but they could not get rid of the offense.
Jim Furyk's squad required eight points from 12 individual games Sunday in order to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood are the first European rookies to win four points after each other and he and Molinari, who have been called "Molliwood" after an amazing weekend, are the second bar to have four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After fouling Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls they collaborated brilliantly to beat Woods on American rookie Bryson Dechambeau from 5 and 4.
Wood, who dragged himself two games on Saturday, got some special opportunities but has lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and fours and seven after each other.
Justin Rose, unflinching for the morning ball balls, returned as partner to Henrik Stenson in the fours and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka who are first and third in the world from 2 and 1.
Everything went nowhere in favour of Europe on a nice and awful day in the south west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points Saturday.
They made wins of 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four balls and later they yuro Polter and Rory McIlroy of 4 and 3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the Ryder Cup history has a team come back from being four points behind at the start of the individual games, although Furyk's squad only needed an equal score as they are the holders of the trophy.
But, after being second for two days, coming in their daylight looks as if it were beyond their capacity.
North Korea says they will not unilaterally disarm without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said the value of the United Nations said that the ongoing sanctions are strengthening wrongdoing in the U.S. and that the country will not unilaterally remove its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the international institute's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant good will steps" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear exercises and leaflets, decommissioning the site of nuclear tests, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons or nuclear technology.
But, we don't see such a response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our homeland security and in such circumstances there is no way we can disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri has repeated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's opposition from a ranking response to denuclearization where his North Korea will be rewarded when taking ranking steps, his statement was to see significantly as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization altogether as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement between Kim John One and Donald Trum at the first convention between the current U.S. president and North Korean president in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work towards a "dead-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trum promised to guarantee Korean security.
North Korea has been trying to get a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls to lacquer the strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. is required to have "dad-neutralization first" and they increase the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve their goal in a compelling manner, and they are even opposed to the "declaration to end the war," RI said.
"The greed that sanctuaries can conquer is a dream by people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that ongoing sanctions strengthen our wrongdoing."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second convention between Kim and Trump, a convention the president had negotiated at the United Nations a week earlier.
Instead the minister marked the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five days and added: "If South Korea would be the party to the matter of de-nuclearization and not the US, the de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not lie leading to such an impossible situation."
For this reason Ri's speech coverage was very different last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. with North Korean rockets was inevitable after Trump's "Drunk President" called Kim a "rock man" on a self-styled quest.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said that there was a lot of work to be done again and that the sanctions had to wait until North Korea was un-nuclearized.
Wednesday, Trump said he has no specific time for this, saying "if it takes two years, three years or five months - there are no regrets."
China and Russia have argued that the United Nations General Assembly should award Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
But, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations General Assembly Thursday: "Security Council sanctions should be enforced strictly and impartially until we realise and confirm a finished denuclearization.
The Security Council increased the sanctions on North Korea unilaterally in 2006 in order to try to limit the funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and submarine programs.
Ri met with Pompeo on the outskirts of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in order to prepare for a second convention.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go astray.#
Pyongyang left in July saying that progress had been, but for North Korea to accuse him within hours of making "commands like a gangster."
North Korea has promised to meet with Moon this month in order to destabilize the site of submarines and nuclear sites if the U.S. takes "comparative steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "equal steps" he was asking them were the security guarantees that Trump promised them in Singapore and moves towards normalizing the relationship with the US.
Harvard students get a course on getting plenty of rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is being subgraded to sleep more in order to try to tackle the macho culture of studying through the night using caffeine.
Academics found that students in the world's best university are often helpless when it comes to eddy essentials after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham Hospital and Men who has designed the course, a course he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired the beginning of the course after giving a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
‘At the end of the lecture a girl came ata to and said: ‘Why only now do I get to know this, in my last year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleep - it was a surprise to me,' he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is presented for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their well-being in general.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor at Harvard Medical School and the acting director of the university's health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleeping habits.
In another section, the participants learn how a lack of sleep for a long time increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily practices.
‘We are aware that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we are of the opinion that they have a right to know - in the same way as you have a right to know what the effect of smoking on your health is,' added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of being proud to stay up through the night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that lack of sleep is a problem that is getting worse,
Ensure you get enough sleep, and that's quality, should be a way for students to tackle stress, fatigue and turbulence, he said - even to avoid putting pressure on, as a lack of sleep makes the brain believe that you're hungry, making you hungry through time
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, after studying one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and had ‘been inspired to try to get the course for the whole campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to require all post-secondary students to complete a similar study plan before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm for going to sleep, together and to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue lights' that are released by electronic screens and LED light, which can affect your circadian rhythm leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: a try by Menga beats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another poor game from home as Dolly Menga's goal led to a loss of 1-0 to Steven Gerrard's goalless team at Livingstone.
The Ibrox team were looking for their first victory on the road since they beat St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for only the second time in 18 games as a manager to leave the team eight points behind the top league leaders of Ladbrokes namely Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and the Rangers team was short of inspiration and no view of ability became equal.
While Rangers now fell to sixth position, Livingstone rose to third just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after the lunatic Calum Spence had to get treatment to injury to his head after something was thrown from the top of the visitors.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team and beat Ayr to reach the preliminary games of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt remained with the 11 who beat Hearts last week and would like to be in his manner with the way his organized squad committed their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may have dominated in terms of possession but Livingstone did more with the belt when she was by them.
They should have scored after just two minutes after Menga's pass gave Scott Pittman a chance on an Allan McGregor try but the midfielder failed his chance by hitting the belt clear.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could not hit the clear at the back post.
Rangers dominated but there was more hope than belief in playing them in the final crane of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have had a kick from the smash after behind a quarter of an hour after he and Steven Lawless hit but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian appeals.
Rangers got two shots for the target in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's shot.
Although Livi's catch after 34 minutes had been against the run of play, nobody can argue that they only deserved it for their hard work.
Again, Rangers failed and deal and Jacobs deepened play plans.
Scott Arfield made no response when Declan Gallagher passed the belt to Scott Robinson, who was ineffective in passing it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard was as brake as he changed Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and almost the change had an effect immediately as the winger passed to Morelos but Kelly rushed from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's car could have added to their score in the last minutes but McGregor rose well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow failed a penalty from the corner.
Second Rangers Glenn Middleton had another try for a kick from the smash after a collision with Jacobs but Thomson again ignored the try.

And now a page of our Almanac "Bore Sunday": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and in CONSTITUTION... the day that the philosopher Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of finding and measuring contamination, a development that would eventually lead to a device called the Geiger Meter.
An important part of science since then, the Geiger Meter also became an important part of popular culture, as in the film "Bells of Coronado" of 1950, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starring as highly unlikely scientists.
Man: "Be' in the world is that?
Rogers: "Measurer Geiger, it's been used to find exotic foods, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you are able to hear the effects of the atoms being released by the radiation in the mines."
Evans: "Well, it makes a bit of a noise now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his birthday at 63.
But the device that was named after him continues to be used.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see' stranger cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see' stranger cells and kill them
The fracture teaches the immune system to identify stranger cells as part of a treatment
The method means to take immune cells from the patient, and adjust them in a lab
Then they will be able to ‘see' a protein that is common in several cancers and they will be re-cycled
A test of the fracture shows hopeful results in patients and different types of medication.
One woman who was treated with the fracture, who learned the immune system to identify stranger cells, saw your ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method means taking immature cells from the cleft, and adjusting them in a lab so that they can ‘see' a protein called HER2 that is common in several cancers, and then reactivating the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said : "Our results suggest that we have a very addictive fever."
HER2 "acquires the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and spinal/rural palsy, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and their ‘learning' how to target cancer cells has worked to treat types of leukemia.
After his appearance on SNL, Kanye West began on a speech from Trump party by wearing an MAGA cap.
She went not well
Kanye West was booed at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a confused performance where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the Presidency in 2020.
After performing his third by that night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again cop, he wrestled against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I'll talk to a white person and I'll say: "How can you like Trump, he's from our toilet?
Well, if I'd been worried about racism I would have left America a good time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch including Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony near almost the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding accusations of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a video of West freezing was loaded up into social media by the victim Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to watter West by posting it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had been bullied behind the stage for what he was wearing on his head.
"They bullied me to behind the platform.
They said, ‘paid and went out with the cap then on.'
They bullied me!
Then they say I'm in a low place," he said, then according to the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead: "Do you want to see the low place?" saying he would "put my superman's skull on, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move ahead?
Tried love."
His comments were booed at least twice by an SNL audience and the cast members were annoyed to see, Variety reported, with the same person telling the publication: "Aeth the studio is all completely quiet."
West had been added as a late second to the Ariana Grande pageant, as her former lover the rapist Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West caused confusion to a number by performing the by I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West gained support from the head of the TPUSA parliamentary group, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest characters: DEATH FOR WARNING THE HAID."
But musician Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just not "being himself and being that excellent."
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "gel") who is in my opinion to memorize and declare ideas that are harmful to my community.
It's free.
And we are too," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his new name was "the being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, who has also been called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His with a rapist, Snoop Dogg has got the name Snoop Lion and of course the late Prince musician changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist presumably known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder after a case of drowning in a restaurant in Melfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The chase took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear near the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington kills on poisoned shark
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has killed on the stereotype of macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys feel that they have to be hard to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that ‘something has gone wrong' and questioned how to tackle and problem poisoned males in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who married his fellow actress on Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also at 31, recently admitted that he felt strongly over addressing the problem.
‘I feel strong at the minute--what has gone wrong with malevolence?, he said.
‘What have we been teaching men as they grow, as to the problem we have now?'
Kit is of the opinion that television is partly responsible for the progress in poisonous males and that is due to the very male characters.
He went ahead: ‘What is a statute and what is being taught?
What is being taught on television, and on the streets, which makes boys feel that they must be a special kind of man?
In my opinion that's one of the great questions of our era - how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he admitted that he would not make any other Game of Thrones programs when the series ends the next summer, saying he had ‘quite enough on fights and horses'.
From November Kit will star in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard which is a story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing to do from Game of Thrones.
‘I met a woman on the programme, so in a way it gave me my family, and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's lover who is Kit's character, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family stop in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of its citizens living with HIV and Aids.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people of the country are suffering.
About 40,000 new cases were marked in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of the cases were transmitted through sex, indicating a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of blood-stained supplies.
But the number of people holding HIV like this has been almost reduced to nothing, China health officials said at a convention in Yunnan province.
But, from year to year, the number of people in China living with HIV and Aids has increased by 100,000 people.
HICV transmission through sex is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Equality was decriminalized in 1997, but according to the mention discrimination against LHDT people is a rump.
Due to the country's civic values, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transfers of the sizes are the result of inadequate sex security in these relatives.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general access to HIV medicine as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that a member of staff had released senatorial data of the Republicans, killing on ‘dangerous cells' and ‘increased damages'
On Saturday Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of his staff had posted information about three Republican Senators to the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles demanded that the charges be spread by "right extreme" pundits.
"Celebrities, lies, and more lies," Walters said in a statement to Twitter.
Commenting on the release information included home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information spread online Thursday, after being posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing by a panel of the Senate on charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh who has been nominated to the Goruchel Court.
The information was released after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Occupational websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address that marks the source of the postings was related to Waters' office and they released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unsalted accusation is wrong and a naked lie," Waters then said.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and security had been compromised as a result of these perjury and wrong allegations - was not responsible in any way for the release of this information.
This unsalted conviction is wrong and a naked lie."
Waters' statement was criticized the online fast, including by former press secretary at the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This denying is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that it does not have the nature to be a Member of the Congress.
When someone gets accused of something they didn't, they can't get angry.
Out of them is not that challenging.
Out of them no question the offender's motive.
They must be calm and intimidating."
It appears that Fleischer compared Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing angry robbing during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Mayor if true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had informed "to the appropriate authorities and to the law enforcement agency of the cheating claims.
"We will make sure the criminals are exposed," he said "and that they are accountable for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – parodying a weak spy with Rowan Atkinson
It is a tradition now to look for references to Brexit in any new film that has British orientation and is to see fit for this revival of the upcoming Johnny English series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is self consumption a tongue in the cheek on how sobor we won't be the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, the non-clem Johnny English has been licensed to dive everything back for the second work - with his name more than anything showing that he is a comic character who has been created for cinema participants in countries that do not speak English.
Of course this is the true spy who although his noble claims consisted a little bit of Clouseau, Mr Bean, on a man who contributed one note to by Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
Originally based on the passenger and the mysterious man Atkinson played him in a Barclaycard advertisement, leaving a distraction after him.
There are one or two good scenes in the latest Johnny English film.
I loved seeing Johnny English go towards a helicopter wearing armor and the rotor blades hitting against his helmet.
Atkinson's dawn with physical comedy is to be seen, but the humor is weak and strangely unnecessary, especially now that "different" films like 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as an element of their films.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's real misfortunes are not as clever and specific as Atkinson's quiet jokes in Bean's persona.
The interim idea is that Great Britain is in a great turmoil.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's secret network of spies, freeing up the identity of all the spies that Britain has in the field, though they remember the hide-out on duty - a sad and minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final step for a self minister who is self righteous and surrounded, and who is already suffering from enormous political ambivalence. Emma Thompson does her best with the character Teresa Mayian but there is a great deal in the script to work with.
Her hidden attendants inform her that every spy has been risked and that it will be some for her to come and someone out of retirement.
And this means Johnny English himself, who works as a schoolmaster at some prestigious institution now, but gives secret lessons on how to be a spy: some good jokes here, as English gains a school-like spy from f Rock.
English is transported back to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and he gets a reunion with his former partner Bough, being played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to an underwater ship comander, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is servant.
So the Batman and Robin of getting things wrong is back on His Majesty's service, coming across Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful fatale femme Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is busy being shunned by a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can deal with British computer problems: Jason Vola is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start on their laughable journeys: dressed as attendants, they put a crooked French goat on fire; create a chase when trying to get on Volta's foeless ship; and English causes an absolute unrest when trying to use a Virtual widget to converse with the inside of Volta's house
They make a very good show from it in the last scene, but for so jolly and awesome, there's a little bit of a feeling of children's TV about the whole thing.
Very decent.
And as with the other Johnny English movies I could not think: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes fair play with his talents?
Labour party deny that it is preparing a plan for British people to work for four days a week but be paid for five days
Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn considers a radical plan that would mean that the British people are working a week of four days - but are paid for five.
According to the mention the party wants the heads of companies to pass the savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution on to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would mean that employees get a weekend of three days - but get the same salary.
The sources of the saying that the idea would match the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country from the workers' party.
Change to a four-day week has been approved by the Labour Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A high source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: ‘policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight but a four-day week is an elevation that matches the party's attitude towards restructuring the economy of the workers' party as well as the party's general defensive strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a work week of four days during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at present the promotion is not all approved by the Labour Party.
A spokesperson on behalf of the Labour Party said: ‘A work week of four days is not a policy of the party and neither is it considered by the party.'
Chancellor of the cable John McDonnell used the party's convention last week to expand his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from ‘unnamed directors' and ‘practices' of the public resource companies.
The cable auction plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies will not all be cashed back as the Labour government could make ‘denials' on the basis of apparent evils.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive Ownership Funds to put 10 per cent of companies' equity; the private sector in the hands of the workers, would have annual shares of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" that the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into claims against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raised the question whether the FBI's findings could cause any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be broadcast Sunday, prosecutor Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could uncover something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was to see more openly than his counterpart from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said to before the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I phoned him after this happened, after the charges came out, I said to, ‘Do you do this?'
It was decisive, determined and unambiguous."
However, Graham's plea to see firm.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and would take a terrible charge," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett was completely denying it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And nobody she named could confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizenship Festival, an annual musical event which has an impressive list of stars taking part and a message that is so impressive: to remove poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizenship Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and also to raise awareness of the festival’s main intention to remove extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Plan, an international advocacy group that hopes to remove poverty by increasing the number of people who struggle against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" like volunteering, world leader emailing, making a phone call or anything other valuable to help raise awareness of their goal of removing poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizenship Festival been with only 12 years left to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with aggression for not being a good way of persuading people to demand change or just another cause of "clicktivism" - people feel they make a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the World Citizenship Festival says they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters, illustrating a variety of characters.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to publish commitments and policies equivalent to $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group made reference to 390 commitments and publications that were derived from their actions, with at least $10 billion of it having been class u or raised.
The group estimates that the funding that has been confirmed so far has had a direct effect on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and activist partnership that has committed to "helping children reach their full potential," promising to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help remove a lack of nutrition in the country after having over 47,00 referrals from Global Citizens.
"With help from the UK government, participants, state governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social inequality and lack of nutrition a foothold in history," Tracey Ullman journalist of The Power of Nutrition told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group said the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritious food, after over 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions and their website was asking" what makes you think we can get rid of extreme poverty?
The Global Citizenship Festival replied: "It will be a long and narrow path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists performing at this year’s new York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy for "warship" to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's intervention in Syria - specifically, where it operates at the invitation of the legislative government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I am of the opinion that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to deal in energy as they mean doing in Eastern Europe, and southern Europe," he said according to the mention.
And, according to the officer, there are ways to address this and this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that the sea routes are open, and, if necessary, to give hazards, to make sure their energies do not reach the market," he said.
Zinke greeted the audience at an event he was getting to support from the Consumer Energy Alliance, a not-for-profit group that describes itself as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they were more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure and take fuel substitutes," he said by stating that Russia's economy is completely dependent on and fuels fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump government tries to increase exports of its liquidated natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest option of downsizing for users in Europe.
To that end Trump's government officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline's "immediate" plan, which according to Trump makes Berlin a "aggression" to Moscow."
Moscow has repeatedly repeated that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is just an economic project worth $11 Billion and that will double the current capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's coarse opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion we share the belief that energy cannot be used to put pressure and that the users should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stand has elicited a harsh response from Germany, who have confirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US to keep abreast of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "Standing in Hard" Apply for the Presidency in 2020, Senator from Massachusetts
Saturday Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "consider hard" to apply for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman on the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider hard to apply for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion about Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying that he was "leading the country to the wrong direction.
"I'm worried in the marrow of my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been unflinching on a tongue in his criticism of Trump and his nomination for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an investigation by the FBI before police."
But, a pinion poll that was released Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's electorate does not believe she should apply in 2020.
Fifteen eight percent of Massachusetts' "typical" voters said the senator should not stand back the pinnacle of the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported such an attempt.
The pinnacle poll showed much more support for an attempt by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a possible attempt and 48 percent against.
The other Democratic names that have been credited as possible candidates in 2020 include the former Deputy President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said that he will officially decide by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin addresses PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence Monday night
"What my son is suffering, what he's suffering from coming back, I can sympathize with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the bribes that some of our soldiers are returning with," he told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other former soldiers, "they come back differently, they come back harder and they come back asking whether there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen are, and every other member of the armed forces has given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and accused of an attack of domestic violence on a woman, interfering in a report on domestic violence and having a weapon in his possession while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman on behalf of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a challenge to the new refugee policy
Fifteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the U.S.'s new policy that rejects leeches to victims fleeing from domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from the 18 states and DC did present a friend-in-law brief Friday in Washington supporting a refugee seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News said.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was introduced by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy, has not been disclosed.
He said that his partner "and his violent sons were members of a gang," had been wrongly treated but U.S. officials denied her request for refuge on July 20.
She was kept in the detention in Nhexas.
He described the province's turmoil supporting Grace El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which many asylum seekers produce in the U.S., as countries facing major problems with domestic violence and gangs.
The U.S.'s new refugee policy reverses a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Immigration Appeals which allowed undocumented migrants to apply for refuge if they fled from domestic violence.
District Court of the Columbia Area Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy is "to ignore decades of dependent, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that any request for refuge be addressed on the specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition goes contrary to that principle," said the friend-of-the-law brief.
The tortoise made further arguments in the brief the policy of denying access to migrants harmed the US's econometrics, saying they were more likely to be entrepreneurs and to "provide necessary labor."
Country Tory Jeff Sessions made orders that immigration judges not give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"There is shelter available to individuals who leave their home countries due to persecution or fear due to their race, religion, gender, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said when announcing the policy on June 11.
There was no refuge in being to alleviate all the problems - up in the ed of the serious problems - which people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts ensued in Palu as the deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
To the losers, the situation was progressively critical.
"He felt very anxious," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was comforting her sick son at a migrating center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance comes and bodies are in.
Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their homes which had been destroyed, searching through their weary eddies , trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overrun
Some of the patients, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's military hospital, where they were treated in the open air due to strong back injuries.
He brought tears to his eyes as he mentioned feeling the earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed to the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope that they are safe."
US ambassador accuses China of bullying with ‘propagandist notices'
A week after one of China's official newspapers ran a four-page advertisement in a daily newspaper in the U.S. promoting trade benefits between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump made reference to the attachment of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's most popular newspaper - after accusing China of trying to intervene in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, allegations that China denied them.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. elections was a new step in an ambitious campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is typical for foreign governments to set up notifications that promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting an increasing trade war that has led to both countries placing tolls on each other's imports.
China's toll early in the trade war was designed to target exporters in states like Iowa that support the Trump Administration, said experts from the US and China.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, a significant importer of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a piece in the Des Moines Register Sunday, "that China no longer confirms that bullying by running propaganda advertisements in our free press is ours."
"While spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of America's important tradition of freedom of opinion and freedom of the press by setting a notice which they have paid for in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the newspaper stand down this street in Beijing, you would find it difficult to find incompatible voices that you would not see very reflective of the diverse ideas that the people of China have about China's anxious economic path, as the press is under the umbrella of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's foremost newspapers has rejected the offer to publish" his article, though he did not say which paper.
Analysts Warning that Republicans Dismiss Women Who Vote Before the Mid Term Elections with Llanast Kavanaugh
As a number of Progressive Republicans supported the nomination to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the wake of several allegations of sexual misconduct, dissenters have warned that they will see a response, especially by women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions about this have been very high, and a majority of the Republicans on the record are already saying they want to proceed with the vote.
You can't pull these things back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political principles at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill in an article published Sunday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's (G-Arizona) last minute effort to get an investigation by the FBI would be enough to silence unhappy voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson to the progressive group MoveOn said Friday, according to the newspaper from Washington, D.C..
Fore Friday, protesters shouted "November is a coming man!" as they protested in the Senate assembly as the Republicans who control ‘the Judicial Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Doctor Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The Democrat's enthusiasm and commitment is going to be huge," Stu Rothenburg, a non-black political analyst, told the news website.
"People say they're proud already; that's true.
But it could increase, especially among unscrupulous women on the outskirts of the towns and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who although they do not like the scene often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her accusations of sexual violence against the nominee to the Supreme Court, analyses suggested that there would be a strong response if the Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"This has developed to be an absolute mess for the Republicans," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"This is just about the committee vote or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt and this and the way they have treated her," noted Guy Cecil, director of ISA Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, at the news channel.
But it appears that Americans are divided as to who to coegulate following Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more sided with Kavanaugh.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents are sure or are against believing Ford's testimony, while 35% say they are sure or I like believing Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% said they believed it was certain or probable Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After the campaign by Flake, the FBI is now investigating the claims made by Ford along with and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford gave evidence on an allegation near the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her while he was drunk when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Goruchel Lys, donated his sexual organs to her while they were at a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Device Is Aiming to Start a New Internet to Go to Awakening with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new technology pioneer project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid lets users choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In a definitive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee lamented that the intent of the Inrupt company was to "control the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online database" or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists to make, calendar, music library and other personal and professional resources.
It is so that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and to with at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data warehouse is that it is up to the user completely who gets to see what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authority through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to Company Chief Executive John Bruce, is for the company to bring in appropriate resources, processes and skills to help ensure Solid is available to all.
Currently the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, worldwide technology developers could create self-declared apps using the resources available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about introducing a completely complete change where their business models are completely shortened overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's aim is to provide commercial and ecosystem energy to help protect the accuracy and quality of the new web that is created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the issue over the availability of the Internet.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Consortium, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely hoping for this next lesson in the history of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Victoria Cross First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
The Subordinate The Parish of Bernard Vanny won an award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But, he was killed by a hidden shooter four days later without knowing that he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a convent in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was extremely symbolic that the stone was demolished exactly 100 years after the mishap that won the award to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1928 the Vann Subordinate led its battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog and attacks by field guns and machine guns."
He later rushed to the daunting line and with the "greatest courage" led the line forward before ruthing to a field gun on his own and slogging three of the crew.
Subordinate Vann was killed by a German shooter on 4 October 1918 - a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his dad's actions were something "that I could never compare but that insults someone."
He and his brother the Doctor James Vann mounted a torch after the march, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "very proud of having been part of the march" adding "that the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the support being given by so many people."
MMA fans stayed on their feet all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pink in place
Imagine this, you've waited on your feet through the night to watch Bellator 206 just to be banned from watching the main show.
The event from San Jose consisted of 13 matches, including a cheque on the main card and was shown live through the goal in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face each other, the spectators in the UK were left starving as the screen changed to Peppa Pinc.
Some were unhappy on from that they stayed on their feet all night particularly to watch the ordeal.
One backer on Twitter described the change to children's cartoon as "some kind of bad joke."
"Government regulations said the content was not suitable after 6 a.m. so it had to change to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications to Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa's the pig," yes."
Scott Coker told Bellator company president that they will be working on their timetable so that it includes future UK audiences.
"I'm thinking when thinking about the re-show, that we can make it work," Coker said.
"But she's six o'clock this morning on Sunday there and we will not be able to deal with this until she's Sunday our time, Monday their time for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the programs changed there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and they were all not friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought that was a technical problem.
But that was not the problem, it was a matter of governance.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We'd have to keep it to five matches instead of six - as is normal - we tried to give the fans too much and it was a long rush.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘substantial' because of his sexuality
The plumber Tom Daley says he has grown up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old plumber said he hadn't realized until he went to high school "not everyone like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs to be presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gays' rights in order to give others "a hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him worry less about winning the Olympic games.
The usual presenter of the long-established programme, Kirsty Young, has taken several months of break due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "less than" everyone else when growing up "because she wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "Even today, those feelings of feeling less than, of feeling different, have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so that he didn't disappoint everyone when they came to know about his sexuality.
The two-time winning Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to de-cross equality.
He said that he had declared his opinion because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without oblivions and that he wanted to give "good hope" to others.
The world champion said that falling in love with a man - the American film maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he did meet in 2013 - "was unexpected."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than from, last year but said the age gap has never been a problem.
"When someone goes through so much very young" he went to his first Olympic games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had lived through similar highlights and subpoints.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all perseverance" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But, there are more things than winning Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having a diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that the one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 again - he wanted to be in the front row.
"I can't tell him ‘you're not going to be around to be in the good front row'," he said.
"I was trapped in his hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and he was from having died was the gunman to recognize that he was not of our ancestry," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that this is what I had dreamed about throughout my life - to plunge in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first cane choice - Proud by Heather Small - who had been reassigned as of before the Olympic games and was still giving him beer skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not at his best on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phill Mickleson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his standard to avoid having an unhappy mile stone.
Mickelson, who plays in the two-legged event for the 12th time, was put on the bench by captain Jim Furyk Saturday for the games the head and fourths.
Instead of being in the middle of the activity, as has been so frequent for the United States, Mickelson, who has won five majors, shared his day between being a musician and working on his gem in the hope of improving the problems he has.
Since the straightest of drivers was not even at the highest point of his career, the 48-year-old player is not a good choice for Le Golf National's tight course, where the rough long punished thrilling shots.
And if the course itself isn't frightening enough, Mickleson, in Sunday's ninth match in the face of the right-hander of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has cooperated with the Tommy Fleetwood rookies to win all of their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12 single games, got a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely necessary.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, though he could not do anything else.
"He understood the role he had today, beat my back and put his arm from my compass and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has added so much to these assets in the past, and this week.
I didn't predict that he would play two games.
I predicted more, but as then she has worked out and as then we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the largest number of Ryder Cup games Sunday.
It could be an end to Ryder's Cup career that has never reached the highs of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven half centuries, although Furyk says his presence is an unrealistic boost to the team.
"It's tough, sarcastic, frantic, it's like making fun of people's head, it's a great person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the young players are having fun making fun of his head too, this week, was nice to see.
It contributes much more than just awareness."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of individual games at the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Daniad had its first match at Valderrama in 1997, where a team captained by Steve Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but by the end line the advantage was down to a draw with Europe winning from 14 – 13.
Remind yourselves that we have a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won but only from a thrill," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team win 5 to 3 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10 to 6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You have to drill your best tomorrow.
Get out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the trophy, and that's where we'll focus.
I've said since the beginning, I'm focused on the 12 players in our squad, but we're also aware of what syn stands the och draw - the best players in the world."
He was delighted with the way his players have performed on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be great about this.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come to the front, and that's a completely different thing to do.
It's great to get that out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there on your own, you're proven to the extreme as a golfer.
That's the message that needs to be given to the players, which is do your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he must do his best too."
Unlike Bjorn, captain of the Americans Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk has been at both ends in the major victories on the last day, as he was part of the team that won at Brookline before losing after Europe secured the "Weirth at Medinah."
"I remember every word of it," he said after being questioned how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, made a boost to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to start fast as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When the momentum goes in one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those games in the middle.
We set our line so and put the men out like we want, we're trying to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas has had the task of trying to lead the fight back and is facing Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other European players in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of players in this order because I believe they will work well all the way," Bjorn said about his choice for the individual games.
New German Warship Lifted Once Again
The new German tank frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old warships from the period of the cold war, but it will not be available until at least next year due to increasing faulty and cost systems, the local media said.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates , has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to newspaper Die Zeit referring to a lieutenant on behalf of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems after its provision have plagued the facade of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships that were ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
According to the mention they will include a powerful cannon, rows of anti-aircraft projectiles and anti-ships along with some mystery technologies, like radar signature, infrared and smaller sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to invent the new frigates for up to two years away from their home ports.
But continuing delays mean that the warships will be pioneering - which will allow ‘Germany to throw its power over the sea - after the age by which they will begin to serve, Die Zeit said.
F125's frigate was in the headers last year, after which German Lynges refused to commission the ship and returned her to the Blohm & Voss ships yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to ship builders after it had been supplied.
The reasons behind the ship's return were not clear, but German media referred to a number of vital "software and hardware flaws" that meant the warship was good to nothing if she had to fight.
Software shortages were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be run by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the numbers on the Bremen class frigates.
Also, it became apparent that the ship over her weight was a leak that worsened her performance and reduced the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" which is 7,000 tons was twice heavier than similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the defective hardware, the price for the entire project - including training the crew - is beginning to be a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from €2.2 billion to begin.
The problems of the new frigates are becoming ever more important considering recent warnings that German tank power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliamentary defense committee acknowledged that the Navy was "run out of ships that can be found."
The official said the problem had worsened over time, as old ships had been decommissioning without new ships having been provided instead.
He asserted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the hidden lives of bats
New research work is being done at a stop in the Scottish Highlands which seeks to reveal how bats use the grounds to hunt for food.
The hope is that the findings will throw new light on the behavior of the unique mammals and that it will help with future conservation activities.
The study by the scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will follow the least common bat on a least soprano bat along with long-eared bats and water bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the site in order to keep a look at the activity of the bats throughout the season.
NHS volunteers and staff will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
A specialized audio analysis of the recordings will find the frequency of the bats' calls and what species does what.
Then a report and a preliminary map will be produced to create a detailed landscape size picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the Scottish National Trust nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important to the bats and how they are used by all species.
The information will help determine the advantages of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how to manage forests for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are under threat by construction and development work that affects their glands and leads to habitat loss.
Wind and lightning turbines can also be dangerous, along with porous holding paper and some chemicals in building materials, and attacks by cats.
Toiletries are not blind.
But because they hunt at night their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching their food.
They use a sophisticated eco-learning technique to see prisms and obstacles that are ahead of them.
The National Trust of Scotland owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and over 76,000 hectares throughout the country and they are highly concerned about bats.
They have ten trained specialists, who conduct consistent surveys, visits to cliffs and from turn to turn rescues.
The organisation has established Scotland's first bat protection at Threave stop in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The stop manager David Thompson said that the grounding of the stop was perfect for them.
Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have many old buildings, many old trees and all the good harvest.
But there are many that we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and at other sites will help us understand more about what is needed though man they can thrive."
He emphasizes searching for bats before doing any maintenance work in buildings as the destruction of one maternity lock could potentially kill up to 400 female and young bats, killing all the local population.
Bats are secured and it is illegal to kill, inflict or disturb on them or destroy their claws.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has been urging the public to give handy help.
He said: "We have a great deal to learn about our bats and with a number of our species we don't know if their populations are doing well or not.
Ronaldo dismisses allegations of violence as his lawyers prepare to pursue a magazine from Germany.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of violence against him a "false news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to pursue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the claims.
A Portuguese and Juventus frontman has been accused of harassing an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a room at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
In, he is alleged to have paid $375,000 to her to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking white Instagram video Live to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were publicized, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news" his player, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is okay," added the player by smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel because of the claims, claims which they have called "an inadvertent expression of doubts in private matter," according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "a moral nibble of a sum corresponding to the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious crimes in relation to personal rights in the last few years."
The alleged incident was said to occur in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are demanded to return to the player's room, where he tried her harshly, according to the papers that were presented with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 per cent" was "a good man" who was disappointed by the "one per cent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga claims she approached the police and that pictures were drawn from her injuries at the hospital, but later he agreed to an arrangement outside the court because she was "of care" and that she was worried about "get her publicly ashamed."
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to reverse the arrangement as she continued to be harmed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from United Forces when the claimed attack occurred, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK would regret losing car makers forever
The UK would "be forever regretted" if it lost its status as a world leader in terms of car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
She added that it was "breachful" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that they would cease production of a temporary car at its factory in Burnaston near Derby if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," Mr Clarke said.
The car maker from Japan said that delays on the border could lead to job losses if Brexit were without agreement.
The factory in Burnaston - which builds Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year and nearly 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion to if Britain fell out of the EU at the end of March construction would stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's director manager at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised concerns about the effect that leaving the EU without an agreement will get it on trading across the border, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, have said they will close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns regarding what the car manufacturers say are risks in the supply chain if Brexit were without agreement.
Toyota's production line is run on a "only in time" basis, with pieces arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars that are built on orders.
If the UK would leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March there could be problems on the border, problems the industry says would lead to delays and lack of pieces.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than two days of stock at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so the construction would have to be terminated.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the relationship with the EU in the future "has been carefully drawn up to avoid those inspections on the border."
We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity," he told Today's Radio 4 programme.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with a series of fulfillment chains that have been very successful."
Toyota was unable to tell about how long the work of production would end, but in the long term, warned that additional costs would affect the factory's ability to compete and that it would eventually lead to job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union assemblyman at the factory, said that his members were progressively concerned: "From my experience to once these jobs have gone they don't come back.
A spokesperson on behalf of the government said: "We have proposed a detailed and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House said
An important meeting of Donald Trump with the state treasurer Rod Rosenstein's delegation could be "held for another week" as the struggle over the nomination to the supreme court of Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated interference by Russia in the election, connections between Trump's and Russia's defendants and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
It is whether Trump's dismissal of the state waterfront delegation, thereby risking Mueller's independence, has been as on Washington's tongue for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a device to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of removing the scene by using the 25th enhancement.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, as there was mention that he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "well have not" dismissed Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid conflicts with the hearing of the Senate judiciary committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexually misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, gave evidence.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the claims against Kavanaugh, delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Here he said about the meeting with Rosenstein: "There is no date set for that yet, it could be this week. I can see that being postponed for another week because of all the other things that happen in the court supreme.
But we can see if I always like to give the press the latest information."
Some reporters would doubt that claim: Sanders has not held a brief to the press in the White House since September 10.
Prosecutor Chris Wallace questioned why.
Sanders said that indifference towards "orchestu" television journalists was not the reason for the lack of briefing, though he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they're overheard."
He then suggested that the direct link between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is doing more Question and Answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without quoting any evidence: "We have looked at those numbers."
Sanders said that briefing would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the US president, that's much better than talking with me.
We try to do so often and you've seen us do a lot of that during the last few weeks. This will instead be a press briefing where you can talk to the US president."
Trump often receives questions when leaving the White House or when he participates in open sessions or conventions to the press with visiting presses.
Individual conventions to the press are rare.
In New York this week, the scene showed why, when making a bitaroo and odd appearance at moments in front of losers.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at Scottish NHS over concerns about Brexit
The Health secretary has written to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express their appreciation in the country by wishing them to stay there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay for application costs for the status of a fixed resident to EU citizens working for the declared public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on departure have continued, and it is expected that decisions will be in autumn.
But the UK government has also been toughening preparations for the possibility of a ‘no agreement' situation.
Make sure that this period is an inevitable one for all of you.
That's why I want to say again how much I appreciate each member's contribution from staff, no matter what their nationality.
EU-wide coworkers and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Certainly Scotland is your home and our very desire is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie gets urgent surgery after head injury
The linebacker Christion Abercrombie who plays for the Tennessee State Tigers has had a hasty turnover after suffering an injury to his head as the team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores from 31 points to 27 on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessee team.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Rees told reporters that the injury had occurred a tock before half time.
"He came to the sideline and sort of fell there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel brought oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and escorting him back for further assessment.
A Tennessee State Department official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the surgery at Vanderbilt's medical center.
Harris added that there were "no details on the type of injury or how bad the injury is yet" and Tennessee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is a second-year redshirt student, is in his first term with Tennessee State after he was transferred from Illinois.
He got five tackles all Saturday before he had to leave the game. That brought the total tackles of the season to 18.
Buyers from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK.
Buyers from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to give help to the homeless under new plans by the Tories.
This proposal will neutralize Corbyn's campaign success to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp tax will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year- to assist the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that buyers from abroad have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to give help to the homeless.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target those earning large wages.
The increase in stamp tax will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money will promote the Government’s intention to tackle people who sleep out.
The savings- which are additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-set houses - can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects this offer to raise up to £120 million a year.
It seems that 13 percent of brand new property in London is bought by residents from outside the UK, and this increases the prices and makes it difficult for first time buyers to step on the house school.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital- have turned into "unprecedented homes" because so many buyers from abroad spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut of the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and begged Mrs May to put up quotas on affordable houses to fix the "warning houses" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced an impressive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and putting an end to turning people from their "non-failed" homes.
He also wants to give more power to proposals to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year, I said that I would devote my work as prime minister to the restoration of the British dream - that life would improve for every new generation.
And that means fixing our defective houses market.
Britain will always open its doors to people who want to live, work and create life here."
However, it cannot be right that the purchase of houses is equally easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, as it is for British residents who work hard.
To many too many people, the dream of owning a house far from being within their reach, and the amusement of sleeping out on the street continues to be much too real."
Jack Ross: "My ambition eventually is to control Scotland."
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says that his "final ambition" is to be Scotland's team manager.
The Scotsman, aged 42, awoke for the challenge of resurrecting the North-West club, which is currently in the third position in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Higher League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told Sportssound, Scotland's BBC programme.
"When I was a kid, I was raised watching Scotland's Hampden bit with my dad, and it's something that has ever nailed me back.
That opportunity will only come to my part, if I successfully manage a club."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no fear of denouncing such firm names at such a large club, and they had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich.
"The success of me right now will be to see ‘can I lead this club back to the Supreme Court?"
Because of the club's structure and facilities, it belongs to the Supreme Court without if or unless," he said.
"Not an easy invasion will be to get the club there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself successful unless I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been three years since starting his career as a manager, having had a period as a sub manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in one of Hearts' coaching staff.
It was then helpful to raise Alloa after they had fallen to the third tier, and traverse St Mirren from them falling tier to be at the top of the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably quite a tangible point," he said when recalling about taking the lead at Alloa.
"I was really convinced that being a manager was the right career for me, more so than being a player.
It sounds odd because I did it right, I made a resilient living of it, and I got a few to high point.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things to do weekly.
I'm still going through that in terms of the stress and work pressure but management feels right.
I always wanted to be a manager and as I had realised it, I no longer felt more satisfied my world than ever."

The perfect time for a pint is 5.30 on Saturday night, according to a survey.
The hot weather in the summer has given rise to the earnings of British restaurants which find it difficult, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of bars and taverns saw an increase of 2.7 percent in sales in July - but saw a fall of 4.8 percent in the earnings of restaurants, according to figures.
Peter Martin of business consultancy company CGA who collected the figures said: "Because the hot weather has continued, and that England has remained in the World Cup longer than expected, a pattern similar to June that was in July, where pubs saw an increase of 2.8 percent, but that the eating houses had suffered ever more.
After the fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant trade in June, things went from bad to worse in July.
Pubs and bars selling beverages performed best by seeing more progress than eating houses saw of loss.
Restaurants aimed at selling food also suffered because of the sun, although not as much as people running restaurants.
It seems that going out for a drink was just people wanted to do it.
Across the warehouses and bars being controlled, there was an increase of 6.6 percent in liquor sales for the month, while there was a fall of three percent in food."
Paul Newman of leisure and hospitality analysis company RSM said: "These results show a parity in the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and effect of major social events or in the world of sport continue to be major factors in terms of value in the market outside the home.
It is not surprising that eating house groups are still suffering, although a fall of 4.8 percent year after year will be sure to be painful as well as ongoing cost burdens.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for people running dining houses that focus on selling food, and time and tenacity that will give August's more moderate temperatures will give some really needed sustenance."
In July, there was a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, which included new ones which were opened. This reflected the slowdown experienced in introducing new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the UK pubs and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups. They have a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and are the industry’s established benchmark.
One of every five children has hidden social media accounts they keep from their parents.
One of every five children - some as young as 11 years old - have hidden social media accounts they keep from their parents and teachers, according to an overview.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed that there was progress in "Insta fake" pages.
The news has deepened the concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a "best" account to show to parents.
One of every five children - some as young as 11 years old - creates social media accounts they hide from adults.
An overview of 20,000 high school students has shown rapid progress in "Insta fake" accounts - which refers to Instagram's photo sharing site.
The news has severed the concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted.
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a "best" suitable account to show to parents, while also having private ones.
One mother came across the hidden position of her 13-year-old daughter and saw a child as a teenager encouraging others to "dress me."
The research work, by Digital Awareness UK and Conference Headteachers (HMC) independent schools, has found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It poses a concern that so many children in their teens are tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be a "light athlete" on the Scottish Athletics board.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilidh Doyle has been rumored to be on the Scottish Athletics board as an inactive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from the wide range of experiences she has had at international level over the last decade.
"There is great respect for Eilidh across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from having it on board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am eager to be a voice for athletes and hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American won the 200 and 400 metres race at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 at the top of the other four Olympic gold medals he has, and is a regular bundit on the BBC now, but was unable to walk after suffering a pulse of temporary isgemia.
He wrote on Twitter: "Fis back to today I got to stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it is time and tenacity if I do or to what extent I do to improve.
It's been a slaughter but I've completely improved, having learned how to walk again and today I'm doing yachting exercises!
Thanks for all the messages of encouragement!"
There is a variety of online opinions about a nearly pump advertisement that compares mothers with cows
Online opinion diversity is an advertisement by a nearly pump company that compares mothers who feed with cattle being stolen.
To mark the launch of what is known as the "first almost silent pump in the world that can be first worn," the technical goods company Elvie has released a cellulose advertisement in the form of a musical video to show the freedom the new pump gives to mothers who are roaming the breast.
There are four real mothers dancing in a grass scrub and cattle in it, to a track that contains words like: "Yes, I'm a goblin myself, but you don't see a tail" and "There's a fear you didn't notice, these are not pyres, but breasts."
Aiff the chuckle ahead: "Pumping out, pumping out, I'm feeding the baby, pumping out, pumping out, I'm choking the boobs."
However, the advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has been the subject of online burning.
With 77,000 people having seen the video and hundreds having given comments, it has received a mixed response among spectators, with some saying that it does not convey the "heartache" of the dairy industry seriously.
"A very poor decision when using cows to advertise the product here."
Like us they need to beautify and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are brought off within days of giving birth," wrote one.

Another said: "It's understandable that this is dramatic for the mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a pump nearly to mothers who get to keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "An advertisement that doesn't understand the world that is from."
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she saw the song as "deeply overdue."
"This is a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I were still fed from the breast.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The announcement is somewhat hurt but I took it for what it was from.
This is a great product," wrote one
Another said: "This is a fun full advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like "weary."
Neither praise nor criticize the milk industry the advertisement."
At the end of the video the group of women reveal that they have been dancing with the pumps hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign has been based on the belief that many women who pump from the breast feel like cows.
However, Elvie pump is completely silent, does not have wires or tubes and fits into the interior of nursing fra. This gives women the freedom to move, to stick in their babies, and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother said: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and profound launch.
When showing similarities between breastfeeding and breastfeeding cows we wanted to draw attention to breast pumping and all its challenges, showing the unbelievable freedom and well-being of the new pump in an entertaining and intimate way.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has reached the front pages.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the stage to planner Marta Jakubowski while he was using the product.
Hundreds of Mudol Children Moved Back to Camping on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children kept from fleeing has increased sharply although the numbers crossing the border each month have not changed much. This is partly because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration make it difficult to place children with nods.
Traditionally, most negotiators have been entrepreneurs themselves without a right to be in the country, and they have worried about risking their right to remain in the country when stepping forward to permit a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the provision of markers and other adults in the house would have to give fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with the infringing authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior executive of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before the Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor underage children without a company.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or members of the same house as sponsors, live in the country illegally, and a large number of those are foreign criminals.
So we continue to go after those individuals," Mr Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which were previously routine, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by video-conferencing call, rather than in person, in order to plead their case for legal status in front of an infringing judge.
Those deemed ineligible to have assistance will be sent from the country indefinitely.
According to shelter workers and reports that have appeared from the system during the last few months, the longer children stay in the detention the more likely it is for them to feel anxious or depressed. This can lead to violent beatings or attempted escapes.
Prosecutors say that such concerns are worse in a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering can be ignored, due to its size.
It was added that moving children to the pawn city without giving them sufficient time to prepare emotionally than farewelling friends can worsen the trauma many struggle against.
Syria tells ‘threatened forces' from the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
At the inauguration of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in the country is in its wake now year-round.
Moualem, who is also a prime minister's delegate, said that the foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, pretending to struggle against terrorism, and that they will "deal with them appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem demanded that "the war against terrorism is almost on top" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more millions deported from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "improve this sacred struggle until I would have obtained the cleansing of all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Arabs from Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers fighting the country that has been destroyed by war.
In discussing refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances were right for them to return, and he put a fault on "rai of the western countries" for "leaving unreasonable fears" that prompted refugees to keep along.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian institutions to facilitate the process for them to return," he said.
"They have made a totally humanitarian matter a political matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria until there will be a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a cushioning domain in the last important stronghold of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to fuse forward with political debates.
In the wake of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, it was succeeded in avoiding a major attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem emphasized that the agreement has "definite time limits" and expressed hope that military action targeting jihadists would include fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who will "keep their devastation."
With this, Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations secretary-general hopes to call the first meetings of a new committee that will include members of the government and opponents to draft a constitution after the war to Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government to get involved in the committee, saying that the panel's work will "review the current articles of the constitution," and he warned them from interfering.
Why Trump Will Win Second Term
Of accepting that, Mr. Trump could be reelected in 2020 unless, as many of the libertarians hope to be, he is sure that high-profile and scandalous will soon put an end to his presidency.
And that would be, without a doubt, the "most dramatic end to a never-ending audience!"
At present, there are no signs that the watch has tired.
Since 2014, peak hour figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly trebled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million top hour viewers, which has increased from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" program has exceeded the cable television viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a text that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, the ABC drama program runner "Designated Survivor," quoting a cabinet secretary who becomes the scene after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scovell, experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She recalled a trip in a taxi in Boston prior to the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote over Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said of, "For it makes me laugh," Ms. Scovell told me.
Entertainment is in the middle of the unrest.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, which can be brought back to each other, and the state of the global economy.
Only the most privileged watcher has the ability to turn off the TV.
And yet, it goes no further than being an informed citizen when you realize that you are on the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts argue about Bob Woodward's use of the words "intensive background" as he traces information for his book "Fear," a $15,000 messy skin jacket Paul Manafort ("a drop with too much pride," according to the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's descriptions
I personally wouldn't be able to look at Super Mario in the same way ever again.
"Part of what makes you feel that it's like a reality program is that it feeds you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about Trump's program characters being rotated and the daily turn in the story's tail (referring to the N.F.L, praised Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to fail one chapter or you will be left behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern beach of Kauai, but he had swathed inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not leave the screen, not having Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the spotlight.
"I remember when we were doing all the crazy programs then since talent and people said, "This is the beginning of the end to Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was some kind of joke from, but the truth about it is that they were right."

Money from outside flows to the mid-term election races in the House
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district received a stream of money, thanks to the reform of congressional districts meaning that there were two electors in the race for the same seat.
Pittsburg's recently re-designated electoral district favours Conor Lamb who is a Democrat - who won his seat in another district in a special election last year's spring.
Lamb runs against another deputy, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which overlaps roughly with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania declared in January that the old districts were unfairly disenfranchised from the Republicans' party.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a campaign alliance battle between the coalition branches of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania having a close victory in a contest that gained much attention in March in a special election to Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
A Republican had held hold in the seat for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political pundits say the Democrats are on the front.
U.D. penalizes regarding El Salvador's punishment for giving Support to China, Then Removes
Diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without much unfavorable response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heated meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Banama in June 2017. He had a hotel in Manama until partners turned the Trump Foundation management team out.
State Department officials decided to call the heads of diplomatic mission back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "last decisions to refuse recognition of Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesperson on behalf of the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
Punishments were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from America in 2017, which included drug control, economic assistance and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country in Central America and its high rate of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings moved forward, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention aimed at security and economic prosperity to address a similar meeting that was held last year that was considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials explained that they wanted the convention to go ahead, thus putting an end to any consideration to punish El Salvador.
The diplomats said that Vice President Mike Pence was earmarked to inaugurate the convention, which has been scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration puts on the meeting.
And the three messengers returned from America silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no difficult new messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman from the White House on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to give the details of the issue that were described by the three American officials, which included two diplomats who agreed to speak about the internal negotiations on the condition that they were unknown.
The reports were confirmed by an outsider who is close to the administration he also made speaking on the condition that he is of unknown.
Study History
The next major event may be the Robert Mueller special counsel's report on the possibility that Mr. Trump has prevented justice, where there is now considerable evidence in public records.
Accordingly Mr. Mueller also mentioned in his report a discussion whether Mr. Trump's campaign did a confrontation with Russia in the attack on our estates.
If the congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to face accountability to that body, and be prepared to go before voters again, and perhaps a jury of his peers in a long and late head.
A lot of uncertainty belongs to that, and I don't suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable- nor his counterparts in Europe.
Choices need to be made by all of us on either side of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the efforts.
In 1938 officers from Germany were ready to conduct a coup d'état against Hitler, if the west had only resisted it and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of stage collapse.
The course of history turns around such formative points, and the disastrous journey of democracy is mediated or hoarded.
Americans are now facing many of these points of formation.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses the Country District Delegate Rod Rosenstein, the husband who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation faculty?
Rosenstein has been in deep waters ever since this paper reported last year, that he had suggested recording the scene in secret and denouncing that he was addicted to the job.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times report is wrong.
"How do we respond if the investigation the F.B.I has just asked about will Brett Kavanaugh be full or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite claims of credible sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
In the breath of nothing, will we vote in the midterm elections of Congress party which will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, she'll be hard on democracy.
But I think we won't fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
Jews from Czechoslovakia were my mother who was banished to Auschwitz by the same Nazi organization that at one time occupied my courtly home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the candles of the Sabath on the table that showed the swastica.
And that's part of my legacy, how can I not be hopeful about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team faithily before playing against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians, following the drawn match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will mean that they are in a good position to apply from Group G of the European League.
An injury to his knee meant that Graham Dorrans was unable to play this season until the 2-2 draw game with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result to accomplish great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player said.
We started the game thinking we could have something and we came from there with a point.
We might have beaten in the end but, on the whole, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
As of Thursday night, she is another great European night.
Hopefully we could get three points but that will be difficult because they got a good result in their last game. But, with the crowd supporting us, I'm sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely challenging, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made in the club itself, but there's a nice feeling in the place now.
The garbage is good and the boys enjoy it awfully; the exercises are good.
Hopefully we can catch on now, forgetting for the last season and succeeding."
Women lose sleep because of this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that those who took part in the survey had a good idea of the way they wanted to get care, only a few people were talking about that with family members.
About half of the individuals in Nationwide study said they spoke to their married for the cost of long term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about that.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to get that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business Nationwide.
This is where it starts.
Talk to your married and the children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't inform of your wishes far in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, because those options can be important factors in determining the cost.
You should include your financial adviser: Your supervisor can help you think of a way to pay those costs too.
Your options in terms of long term care financing may include a traditional long term care insurance policy, a hybrid value-finding life insurance policy in order to pay for those costs or self-insure with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Develop your legal documents: Stop legal battles.
Make sure you have health care proxies so that you specify an individual you trust to supervise your medical care to make sure professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, you should consider attorneyship for your financial affairs.
You would choose an individual you trust to make your financial decisions over you and to make sure your bills are paid if you are able to do so.
Don't forget the detail detail: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and that he is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write those details in a written scheme so that you are ready.
It's about more than financial issues, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Picture that plan."
Man has been shot multiple times with an air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle as he walks home after a night out.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which occurred at about 02.30 BST, as "a random action."
The sufferer did not see his attacker.
His injuries do not endanger his life and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia Friday, according to officials, with the number of deaths likely to rise.
With connections having been cut, rescue officials have not been able to get any information from Donggala's ravine, an area in northern Palu that is closer to the summit of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have had to migrate after the earthquake struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population estimate of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a precipitation that extends along more than 300km (180 miles) of coast in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The prevalence, an administrative area under a province, had a population estimate of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main supporters of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Clothing for nickel is also important in the province, but most of that work takes place in Morowali, on the coast of the other side of the island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit many times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Seismic Fire Circle and is hit by earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in the latest years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of those were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that made a surge against the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The Pidie Jaya earthquake triggered a raging death in Aceh, causing destruction and alarm as people were reminded of the tide of the earthquake and the dangerous tsunami in 2004.
A tsunami was not caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Lombok, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings leaving thousands of tourists stuck there temporarily.
Oldest Son Sarah Palin Arrested for Domestic Violence Offences
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, promising to report domestic violence and reject the arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance made him try to call the police to inform them of the claimed crimes, he took his phone off.
Palin is kept in the hold at the Mat-Su Advance Facility and is held on an unsecured $500 basis, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "injured, definitely" when asked about his whereabouts, according to the network.
Palin faces three charges of Class A misconduct, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and have a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of Class B misconduct, which has a penalty of a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to inform them of the claimed attack.
The case is currently brought before the Alaska Supreme Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of allegedly reporting the crime of domestic violence, and of possessing a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had given her a punch in her face.
Sarah Pilan was criticised by former militant groups in 2016 after contacting her son's threatening behavior with PTSD arising from his time serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds be killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have broken and the number of deaths is expected to increase during the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, which is north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos shared on social media show at the time of the incident.
Hundreds of people had assembled for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck on the shore.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the pretty punishment for the man who is under suspicion of conducting the bribery attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the pretty punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the many who are under suspicion for the brutal assault in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been given in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is accused of using a rental truck from Home Depot to attack a bike path along the Western Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting the pedestrians and bikers who were in his way in October.
In order to justify the punishment quite, the claimants will have to prove that Saipov had killed the eight individuals "fearfully" and had caused serious physical injuries "fearfully", according to the warning of intent to seek the punishment quite, which has been filed in the Southern Area of New York.
Those two courts are able to give the pretty punishment, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov with the dictation of 22 charges that included eight charges of murder in order to deceive, charges that are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crimes, and a charge of violence and destruction to motor vehicles.
The prosecutors said that the attack asked for "a significant arraignment and planning", describing Saipov's attack as a "fiery, cruel and corrupt one."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the warning of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern Area of New York presented the pretty punishment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was immediately sentenced to prison for life in September 2009.
The last time the pretty punishment was given in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both of them were put to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who hails from Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what had been done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to conduct the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He asked about having an ISIS flag in his room in the hospital too, police said.
He has pleaded innocent to the indictment consisting of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the defenders who represented Saipov, said that they were "almost disappointed" with the decision of the suspension.
"We believe that the decision to seek the punishment quite instead of accepting a guilty plea to life in prison without possibility of being released does only extend the trauma of these events to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked the defendants for not seeking the pretty punishment.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘act on the voice of the people' today during a protest at the Dorian convention.
Former UKIP leader said politicians must ‘understand the pressure' from eurosceptic members - as did one of Theresa May's own MPs suggesting that he should be responsible for discussions with the EU.
At the march in Birmingham, Peter Bone, one of the Conservative members of the backbenches, said that the UK would ‘have gone out' now if Mr Farage were the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces in recommitting her highly divided ranks is based on Dorians who from Aros party join another protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to maintain order on his Chequers plan in the midst of attacks by people who are in favour of Brexit, people who are in favour of Stay and the European Union.
Residents have demanded that she will still try to strike a deal with Brussels for the worse of the recession - forcing Eurosceptic members and Labour members to choose between her package and ‘unprecedented'.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted ‘to hit Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have made him lord and given him the responsibility over discussions with Brussels.
‘If he had been responsible, we would have gone out now,' he said.
MP Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand in favour of Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers.'
Describing his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We did not fight in world wars to be secondary.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that indicated that the public's opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain completely wrong.'
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory member of the Brexit party, was also in the march and told reporters: ‘I say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers aren't popular among the public, the Opposition isn't going to vote in favour of the plan, it's dubious amongst our parties and active allies who walk the streets in order to educate us in the first place.
Don't hit on with Chequers and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs May, he added: ‘Chief ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians had to ‘deem the pressure' if they wanted to ratify the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
‘Because of this it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
‘They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them ‘we don't let you do that'.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel that pressure.
‘We are acting on the voice of the people of the country who have secured a victory for us in relation to Brexit and we will hold on until we are an independent, self-governing and dumb United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, people who are in favour of Aros marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tory flags against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
One of the Labour lords, Lord Adoins, made fun of the President's head because of the security issues they received with the party's app as the convention opened.
‘We are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada's bargain plus, for non-profit borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he said.
‘It's absolute farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit,' he said.
Warren seriously about applying for the position of president
Elizabeth Warren, one of the U.S. Senators says she will "looking in detail at an attempt to be a president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe says the Democrat from Massachusetts had talked about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a provincial Representative on behalf of the GOP, who co-chaired Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been much guessing about her that she could compete against Trump in 2020.
In the event at Holyoke Saturday afternoon, she was meeting with electors for the 36th time using the town hall format since Trump took up her job.
Someone who was present asked whether she intended to stand for the position of president.
Warren said that it's time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a girl at the top."
Arrested after Sims of LSU was shot to death
On Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that someone had been arrested on suspicion of shooting Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, to death Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it had arrested Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, at an ET news convention at 11am.
They had released a video of the shooting Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who is to be seen in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in his head and died immediately as a result," Murphy J. Paul, one of the police chiefs, told media Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and he did admit he was on the site, possessed a weapon, and he did admit he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without investigation and was put in the detention at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a young 6 foot and 6 inch boy who was raised in Baton Rouge. He had played in 32 games starting 10 of them last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching world title after team order helped him win the front on Sebastian Vettel
It became clear after Valtteri Bottas applied before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team order" would play a major part in the race.
From the post, Bottas got a good start and nearly left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went to the first pit leaving Hamilton to reach the traffic at the end of the pack, something that should have been tighter.
The Mercedes went to the pit a lap later by coming out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after coming to himself which saw the Ferrari driver, unbalanced, leave the insides free in danger of catching to go after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then headed for a large part of the race as he held on in his tyres to try to finish quickly and pass to Kimi Raikkonen to secure the fourth position.
He finally came to the poles on lap 44 but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen came to fourth position.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has done great all weekend and he was a noble husband letting me pass.
The team has done great work to get one two," Hamilton said.
That's a Very Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein's head in a rally Saturday because she insisted that she did not share the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
As he spoke at a rally in Northern Virginia, the president did not directly address the evidence that Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead he said that what goes on in the Senate shows that people are "gas and bad and vulnerable."
The one thing that could happen and the blessed thing that has been going on during the last few days in Parliament, when you see the anger, when you see people who are gas and bad and vulnerable," he said.
"When you look at statements and the documents that are shared and then they say "Oh, I didn't.
No I did."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you share the letter?
Remember her answer... you did share the document - "o, o, what?
Oh, naddo.
I did not share the document."
Well, wait a minute.
We did share the document...Nado, we did nothing," he added, watwar the senator.
Feinstein got the letter containing the details of the claims against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and was divided beginning September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had been shared by a member of his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's claims, I did not share his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill said.
She asked me to keep the letter a secret and I did so as she had requested."
But it didn't seem that the audience believed it, and he made a comment during the Saturday night rally: "I'll say something to you, the language of her body was very poor.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worse body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's nomination, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the claims to their own perils.
"They are determined to take the power back through any way that is necessary.
You see the hate, the malaise, they don't worry who they're hurting, who they have to saturate on them to get power and control," said the president according to Meditate.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer gets two hits for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars did right for a loss in the Elite League on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the match back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won the front early as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to level the home team's score before Dwyer restored the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard levelled the score for Dundee before two-time Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This is the third time Adam Keefe's men have lost in the Elite League this season, a team that had unexpectedly beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
This was the fourth time the teams met this season, with the Giants beating the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening catch came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping as Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped provide Cownie's equaliser for 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the front in the first break as he scored his second try of the night at the end of the first period.
The team reassembled home and, once again, Bouchard made sure they had an equal score with a powerful catch at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second period and secured the victory by scoring the fifth goal of his team halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play home against Milton Keynes in their next game Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dead to Ensure Can Hundreds on Aircraft Demonstrate Pre-Derivation
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is called a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people lifted off the ground is safe.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong backfires still hit the area and many stuck in rubble in the city of Palu.
But although his co-workers had fled for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old boy, refused to leave his work in the highly segregated control tower at Palu airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained there to make sure that the aircraft Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to safely pick up.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he believed it collapsed.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman on behalf of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that the decision saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia said.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we missed it this morning before the hostages reached Palu.
"The news's hearing is doctrinal," he said.
Meanwhile, the authorities are worried that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number is likely still rising because many bodies are still under the murals and many bodies that we have not yet reached," said a spokesman on behalf of the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A wave that reached six meters has crashed Palu, which will conduct a crowded funeral Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance brings bodies here every minute.
Clean water is rare.
People steal from the little statues everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the Royal Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help losers but we don't know what they will find there.
The situation is already a disaster, but it could go much worse."
Joko Widodo, Indonesia's President, arrived in Palu Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the move and landing.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok which caused 550 deaths.
Air Force collapses in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a plane crashes in a lagoon
The aircraft company that was flying a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that one man is missing, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew have all managed to leave the plane that was sunk.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not seen one man who was traveling on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airport company said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The aircraft company did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, like his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials say seven people have been transported to hospital Friday.
The airport company said that six people were still in the hospital Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident and how exactly it happened.
The U.S. Air Force and Navy company have said that the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane had gone over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said that the plane had flown in very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other people had been able to walk through water to their center to the emergency exits of the plane that was sunk.
He said that the plane's staff was upset and shouted, and that he had a slight injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors were working to improve a nearby dog and that they had helped to rescue people by using a wind boat to transport people to shore before the plane sunk in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aircraft Security Network shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered aircraft accidents in the last two decades but none of those included Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the night's schedule in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented its case Saturday at the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used mobile phone records to create a full picture of the movements of the 29-year-old defender, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had location data from many mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, going contrary to her previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers' mobile phone during the time he had said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday saying he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had said he had known Chambers since about a fortnight when she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis had deleted Chambers's text messages, calls and contact information from her phone some time after she died.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defender will begin his lockdown arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop awareness?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative picture of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Fryste, claims that hip hop has moved from its roots, which are political messages and address social issues.
They wanted to return to those roots and make hip hop aware popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a new ton of support in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nani of New York pursues a couple for her dismissal following a "multiple" text message
A nanny in New York prosecuted a couple for discriminating against her and dismissed her after she had a text message misdirected by the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denied that they were racist, saying that the situation was as if someone were "trying to benefit."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother to two children, was disappointed when she saw that the child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NAAAAAAAAAAAA PERSON DU ARALL." Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "intimidated", dismissed Ms. Maurice, saying that their old nephew, who was African-American, had done terrible work and that she instead expected Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day of work and then was sent home in Uber.
Now, Maurice pursues the couple for compensation because she was dismissed, and she tries to get compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work with a lodge in which she had been hired to make it to begin, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do things like that," he told the Post Friday, adding "I know this is a case of discrimination."
The couple have criticised the claims that they were racial, saying that bringing Maurice's employment to an end was the reasonable thing to do, as they were worried that they could not trust her after deceiving him.
"My wife sent something to her that she didn't think she said.
She's not racial.
We are not racial people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your kids in charge of someone you've been rude to, even if that was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I don't mind."
Comparing the legal case to "a situation of someone trying to benefit", Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in a fortnight and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to pursue someone so?
That's not a very nice thing to do," said the investment banker.
Although the legal case still went from there, it was a great time before the public's court of opinion condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and rationality.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not associate with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who antedated shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to step into the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
Now, it is very entertaining to know what we know about Paddington's stunning success."
She said that her father, who had been working as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a little poem bear, would have accepted the thing if his work had been rejected, but added that a 60-year celebration since the publication of the books was a "sweet lesson" feeling after his death last year.
She said that her father was proud of Paddington's subsequent success as a little quiet, describing the bear as a "very important member of the family".
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he was of no avail," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you're proud of the child even though you're not really responsible for his success.
I think he considered Paddington's success that way.
Although the work was his creation and his imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dead and I had to say farewell to her over the phone
After her landing, her daughter was rushed to the Loius Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly phoned to say that things were very bad, and that she wasn't expected to come through," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got the call from Nad saying she's going to die during the next two minutes and that I have to say farewell to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, love.
I will be with thee soon.
I will be with thee.
The drugs she had obtained by the doctors to keep her heart beat started to end and left her system.
She had died a little before that and now everything was shut down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could neither narrate nor shout nor cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be brave."
In long and late Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning for the loss of her daughter, got on the plane alongside the other passengers - who were unaware of her propensity.
"No one knew," he said.
I kept my head down, and the tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt the overwhelming sense of sympathy to Nad.
He needed my love and my understanding.
I knew so much he loved her."
Women in grief post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide, work to prevent other people from putting an end to their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspired messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis's son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and he killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day," he said.
Ms Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was an addictive cook and had a heinous smile.
"Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They were always saying that his smile was lighting any room."
However, he gave up his work before he died because it was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that that's about to have an effect again then."
Ms. Davis rendered the cards, "to let people know that there are people who can approach them and talk to them, even if they are a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you have to talk."
Ms Humphreys has been friends with Ms Davis for years, and she lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after he lost his mother.
"Wonder of not saying he felt sad nor low nor nothing so," he said.
"Twenty days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He had reached the bottom one Christmas Day - when the children were opening their gifts he made of nothing making any eye contact with them or nothing so."
He said that his death had been a huge insult to them, but that they had to come through: "He ripped a hole through my family.
It breaks us into pieces.
But we all have to carry on and struggle."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the spotlight as the FBI begins investigating
"I thought, if we could have something like that asked for - a limited investigation in terms of time, limited scope - maybe we could secure a little unity," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "shouting" in the middle of a tireless legislative tag.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their survival involves timing.
There are only five weeks to go until the mid-term elections, on November 6 - if, according to the expected, the Republicans will do badly, then they will be significantly weakened in terms of their efforts to get the man they want him elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to phone Senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was a personal secretary to Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a debate in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to come to a decision and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean refugees ‘disgraceful' under Kim's leadership
The number of people from North Korea who fled to South Korea has dropped since Jim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the Southern unification administration, said there were 1,127 cases of fleeing last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the stricter processes to control borders between North Korea and China and the higher rates that people smugglers raise, are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most people who fled from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is a country to which it is easier to cross than the highly guarded Diplomatic Area between the two Koreas.
China refers to those fleeing as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and she often forces them back to her own country.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is still in war technically - has improved significantly during the last few months.
Earlier in this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for conversations aimed at the denuclearization negotiations that had come to a halt.
This came following the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had abundant debate about working towards removing nuclear in the Korean peninsula.
But, Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves one-sidedly first of all," Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "irresponsible", saying he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called Brett Kavanaugh "horrible" saying that he did not fit, because of the nature of his character, to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribe Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had behaved like that, I'm sure they would have called her "horrible," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional in waging the claims that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost shouting and choked by weeping at times when discussing his family and his time in high school.
Also he specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying that the claims against him "destroyed his good name in a collective and contradictory way" and that organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because his testimony showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think it shows he is unqualified with those statements and the way he accused Clinton supporters and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi petered when she was asked whether she would try to be confirmed, and whether the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be in the Supreme Court nor to be in the court in which he is currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Circuit Court of Appeals D.C.
Pelosi said that she as a Democrat was worried about Kavanaugh's possible cases against the Affordable Care Law or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a parliamentary judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to have someone irresponsible and prejudiced in court expecting us to say, ‘is that great?", Pelosi said.
And It's Women Must Take the Thing.
It's a righteous conversation, months and years of agony accumulate, and it can't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told him 45 years later.
I don't think that's inappropriate, do you?"
She went ahead, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an active officer somewhere, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique and so, when she gets angry and starts crying, I will tell the person who is talking to her, "You think my goal is sad because I'm crying.
Blin I am."
And then I'll carry her on.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed to give expression to anger partly because they are, basically, being misunderstood.
One of the most clear memories I have of an early job, in an office where men were in it most, and I cried by anger beyond words, is an older woman gripping in me the germs of my neck - a cold-hearted manager who always raised fear on me - and he dragged me to the staircase hole.
"Never let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know that you're a fraud.
They think you are sad and they will be glad that they have hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a caring outside wedding on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled back from the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was very frustrated, realized that there was no reason she should not think of applying for the position of president herself.
"I hadn't thought about the decision right," he told me by laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race already, and the last thing he needed was another.
Someone called us "Eira Wen and the Seven Crescents,"
Because she was late in the campaign, she was after her in terms of raising money, so she promised she would not participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
She was a vain battle.
She noted that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a fall?" he asked.
When she made her soup publish that she would not launch a formal campaign, her feelings went too much for her - gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than representatives, and anger due to the prejudice on the basis of sex - and she began to cry.
"You'd think my nerves had crashed," Ms. Schroeder said about the way the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my gravestone?
"She did cry?""
How can a US-China trade war be in favour of Beijing
The first wave of the trade war between the US and China was enough to deafen someone, and although the battle is not over, a tear between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by setting taxes on China's key exports including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
The most significant progress was presented this week with new tariffs affecting the value of $200 billion (£150 billion) of items, taxing, for all purposes, half of all goods brought to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has paid the weight back each time and, most recently, she has placed tariffs of five to ten percent on $600 billion of American goods.
China has promised to correspond to U.S. efforts and not the world's largest economy but one is likely to soon surrender.
Getting Washington to stop her means surrendering to the demands, but moralizing publicly to the U.S. would raise much too much shame on Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing can go from its very summit, U.S. trade war pressure could support China in a positive way in the longer term by ensuring that the two economies depend less on each other.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic panic in either country and another is, in fact, much more dangerous than that of a previously recognized watchdog," said Abigail Grace, a contact researcher who focuses on Asia at the New America Security Center, who is a discussion Marine.
Syria 'already' for receiving asylum seekers back, the Foreign Minister said
Syria says they are ready to voluntarily accept refugee applicants back and it is appealing for help to rebuild the country that has been disrupted by seven years of war.
In addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions were improving in the country.
"The situation on down country is more stable and safe now, thanks to the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is working hard to renovate the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
The conditions are now right for refugee seekers to return to the country after having to flee from terrorism and the harmful economic measures that targeted their benevolent lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he emphasized that he would not receive help with conditions or help from countries that had supported the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The US has lost six times in a row on European soil, and they have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe managed to secure victory as Thomas Bjorn's team, the captain from Denmark, reached the required 14.5 points to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had a difficult tournament, but when he drew the star ball from the U.S. in the water on the 16th hole par-3 he had to surrender the game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the golfer from Italy, had starred in every round, becoming 1 of the 4 players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was upset 5&4 by the weakest player on paper in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top selection, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Ian Poulter of England who probably played in his last Ryder Cup.
And in them playing in his eighth Ryder Cup, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful player ever in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I'm not one to grieve normally, but I can't help that today.
She's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for my choice and for putting his faith in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that we've got the cup back.
The team that's important, and I'm glad I've been able to help," Garcia said through his tears after Europe won.
The baton transferred to his fellow countryman John Ram who beat the U.S. golf hero, Tiger Woods, 2&1 in the game to the singles Sunday.
"I was so glad to beat Tiger Woods because I had grown up watching him play golf," said Rahm, a 23-year-old fox.
Woods lost all of his four games in France, meaning that his record is now in the Ryder Cup at 13-21-3.
And that is a strange stoppage to one of the best players ever as he has won 14 championships in his career, second behind Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, Team USA had trouble all weekend to find the way clear.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the boss here, they battled hard.
We had put pressure on Europe during the morning.
We struggled.
Thomas must be given credit.
He is captain without his second.
Each of its 12 players had played very well.
We will fight back. I want to work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup Committee. We have to move on.
I love our 12 players and am proud to be their captain.
You have to lift your cap to them.
They played better than us."
