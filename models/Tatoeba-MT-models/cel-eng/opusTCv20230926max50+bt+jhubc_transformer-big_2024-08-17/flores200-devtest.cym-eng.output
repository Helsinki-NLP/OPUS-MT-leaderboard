Although one experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola deaths, so far, it has not been shown clearly that any drugs are suitable for the treatment of existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies suggested it had less benefit than tried in terms of preventing death.
In the PALM test, Zmapp served as a controller, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
The United States of America Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than underwriting.

As well as confirming that some dinosaurs have at least feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as three-dimensional color and order.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers are chestnut brown on the upper side with the bottom side of a pale or carrot-coloured colour.
The discovery provides an insight into the evolution of feathered birds.
As dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed shafts, called rachis, but have other feather features - arrowheads and teeth - the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely to be a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample showed adult feathers and not chick feathers.
The researchers suggested that although this was a young dinosaur tail, the sample showed an adult feather and not a chick's mandible.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of each star in the system is stimulated by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which belongs to the flow of the plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is from the perspective of magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Archer galaxy.
The impact the team were looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark substance of the galaxy and the dark substance of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way force the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that the dark substance affects another dark substance in the same way as a regular substance does.
This theory states that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy as some sort of a leucine, and that it contains a number of small particles.

Dr Tony Moll discovered the highly resistant drug tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "deeply distressing and very alarming because of the very high death rate".
Some patients could have contracted the infection in hospital, Dr Moll said, and at least two were hospital health workers.

They are colder than the surface that surrounds them by day and warmer by night.
"Their thermal conductivity is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain quite constant temperatures, but it's consistent with being deep holes in the earth", said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Star-geared Team and of the University of Northern Arizona located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters will isolate themselves in a booth, and place a sheet of preprinted paper showing their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope to the ballot box and signs the voter register.
The law of France is very strict.
Since 1998, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote except for those of the authorised voters who were duly counted.
Candidates are able to send representatives to testify to all parts of the process. In the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Her other race, the Great Slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's sitting group race with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the one that finished in first position, Claudia Loesch of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the one that finished in ninth, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the group failed to sit for women to finish their runs, and 45 of a total of 117 skiers failed to be listed in the Big Slalom.
Madhya Pradesh police found the laptop and mobile phone stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and restored her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of those accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police's senior prosecutor, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said the accused had appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit him, none of them were harmed.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court ever since charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody until there is a charge and a case, but any eyewitness evidence could be corrupted because her image had been published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have looked at publishing pictures as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes "journalists walk a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc of some suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has advised journalists that at least no further comments will be made until the indictment.
The document, according to the secret brief, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Among other topics that will be dealt with is the mention of the future state of Jerusalem which is holy to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requires an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave such presence for only five years.
Shooters in the additional trial on pest control would be closely supervised by keepers, as the trial is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership of NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooters Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Interim Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting campaign were given comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore a new Temporary Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members into office yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the government that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by a failure to hold elections, some due to be held since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people and minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 24 additional cases of overheating, with the company calling them "non-serious".
The administration responded by calling the report's postponement by Apple an "unfortunate verdict".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has kept Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle towards the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, along with the Filipino photographers.
Later the photographers replaced an aged woman as she needed the toilet and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature labour during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs in the uterus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators had discovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
They also paid tribute to the moon.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extremism. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. That's unique just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the comment that "Luna is as weird as me...more so maybe...I love her and I'll see her wishes...hope she's in a better place".
Out of 1,400 people who were questioned prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 per cent of those surveyed share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth to become Australia's last queen.
In the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal was due to swim in both the 100m and 230m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his problems there are doubts about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the drugs needed to overcome his pain as they have been banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at Central Missouri University, has discovered the largest known prime number so far on January 25.
Several individuals verified the discovery using hardware and software by the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water supply to the earth along with an organic substance capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as a "political and stupid clemency".
He is expected to run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft in more detail and provide pilots with more detailed information.
No additional transport is being arranged and above ground trains will not remain at Wembley, and car parking or parking and travel facilities are not available at the stadium.
Fears arose for lack of transport of the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwinian pink, Geospiza fortes, and the invasive cactus pink, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, twisted and twisted. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and stick on another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the pictures painted by hand in books called "decorative handwritings".
This is known as a chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons removed (because Hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Turn the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a waterline toilet in almost every house, connected to a complex sewerage system.
Traces of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The satellite in space gets the call and then reflects it back down, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other transport devices.
Below are more moderate sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many kittens (including loose pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to its success is the concept of the niche, a special job by each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called knuckles.
Kneads consist of one to three adult male lions that belong, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion cubs behave very similar to wolf cubs or dogs (but not to other large cats), and are also very deadly to prey.
A good overall athlete, the tiger is able to climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and ride with five times the force of a strong human being.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but more like the roar of a roaring lion.
Ospreys like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. All the animals that ospreys hunt are almost much smaller than itself.
Scientists think that ospreys follow and find animals to eat (obscurity) by smelling, sensing where they have been on land.
They see very well in the dark with the appearance of the night, and they move very secretly. Oscillators hunt their prey by fusing with their surroundings and then leaping upon their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population it came from (as if moving over a series of mountains or a river, or if moving to a new island so that it is not easy to move back) it will often find itself in a different environment to the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciesism, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciesism is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also offer shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Plants are the main food we eat. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasawrus was the dominant predator of his time, so he was not afraid of anything, except other mosasawrs.
His long jaw was full of more than 70 very sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of his mouth, meaning there was no escape to anything that would cross his path.
We do not know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosaics, and he could even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that came into the water; a giant of a dinosaur like T. rex wouldn't even equal it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of nomad called dormice.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have feasts together and lay on their sides while they ate their meals.
Ancient Rome's meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no grain, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Romani ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each of their gods which was considered the home of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to answer the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a beautiful, open temple, and only the priests were able to enter the temple.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were open counters, looking out across the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the lands of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
In the Norwegian sagas they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while travelling further west, found and called Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Esgimo's clans were already living in the place at the time.
Although all countries were "Sandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not the case. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written at the back of the Declaration of Independence was the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, and its top down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known early in her life, that the large parchment document (it measured 29 inches and three quarters by 24 and a half inches) was rolled to store it.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation has been added only as a label.
Day-D landings and the subsequent battles had freed northern France, but the south was still not free.
They were ruled by France "Vichy". These were French who had agreed peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders rather than fought them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, the attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture that is shared by a significant group of people who live together and work together as a society.
The word "civilisation" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, belonging to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that somehow defines the size of society.
The predecessors of nations are city-states. Peripheral culture implies the transfer of knowledge across multiple generations, permanent cultural footprint and a fair distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as appropriate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress only a component of it - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on provincial authorities, which were often non-cooperative, to enforce all its laws.
He also did not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be reformed and the states were so depriving of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, as well as the Germany national football team, are the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sworda, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the world's 7th largest island!
Because of the cluster, a group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as "island".
Taiwan's beginnings start far back in the 15th century where incoming European sailors record the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, Dutch East India Company established a center in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a loss in the First War between China and Japan (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Shimonoseki Treaty, in which it surrenders sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which controls the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows Room.
Most buildings on the periphery of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, and this was the leading film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is a bit confusing.
Thus the aspect ratio of this format (sharing it with twelve to get the most simple whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (family APS formats, for example) are equal to or roughly equivalent to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates dynamics while keeping a measure of order in an image.
He asserts that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, became subject to scrutiny.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had tied the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
He was the one who brought all the kings of the earth into the presence of the Lord.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this accumulation of power and money led many to question whether this belief was answered.
Shortly after the war began, Britain began a blockade against the German navy.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade was a generally accepted violation of international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing a risk to even neutral ships.
As this tactic was a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant aspects of the majority of citizens and nations were passivity and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each period of China or each family that was in power was a particular royalty.
There was also an unstable era of divided states between each dynasty. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin Kings.
During these times fierce warfare took place between many archers who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China; thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are a number of social effects such as the use of a metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people not to just one ruler.
Occupations were also open to all male candidates after the Revolution, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true for soldiers because instead of the army ranks being based on a class they were now being based on the quality of the gun.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working-class people who were oppressed in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this dynastic life. He used to go to a cave that came to bear the name "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
the cave itself, which survived the times, gives a very living image of the spiritual trends of Muhammad.
Lying on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know that it exists. Once you are inside the cave, it is a complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the beautiful clear sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of a number of large pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt contains a number of pyramids (the large pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "bow up" mark looks like a V and the "bow down mark" looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
It up means you should start at the front and push the bow, and down means you should start at the handle (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Bowing up usually creates a softer sound, while bowing down is stronger and more penetrating.
You are welcome to mark your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the arch marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be treated with respect as usual.
King Louis XVl, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, a frightened Madam Elizabeth, on the 6th October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a swarm of market women.
In a chariot, they travelled back to Paris surrounded by a swarm of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to have their vehicle's windows open wide.
At one point a member of the swarm waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed in front of the Queen who feared for her life.
The war expenditure of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were required to pay taxes to the U.S. municipal organization to pay a large amount of the expenditure and interest on bonds that were being raised in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the special profit derived from the exploitation of Filipino people would amount to the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
In order to understand the Temples you must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era where the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which according to tradition ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide variety of ideas in practice, from the push of technology or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is motivated by basic logic associated with scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence to a broad extent, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherently, rather socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a road network across the country is not economically viable for a carpool alone, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
There was a large element of cultural determination in Romanticism, drawn from authors like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture that belonged to that geography arose, and these, existing in harmony with the place of society, were better than oppressively placed laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Gystennin Fort was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame for being the epicentre of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that Crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices that were worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
This is when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, fashions in the west could be lagging behind for up to 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the era as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to close clothes.
Agriculture is subsistence agriculture that is made to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other quite simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically most farmers participated in subsistence agriculture and this is still true in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often demonstrate their membership through a unique and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and flagging.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, unluck, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "wild" or "wild." Some wild children have been enslaved by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the children had been abandoned because the parents rejected the child's profound intellectual or physical impairment.
They may have experienced abuse or serious trauma as children before being abandoned or before running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When brought up exclusively by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of the particular animal that cares for him, such as his fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step beyond that.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that supports individuals with a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold but so is the man small paper clips in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in the software and are intended to question, motivate, and explain procedures that may have been challenging for the students to cope with on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide range of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they are.
We believe that the Foster Care System is a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is meant to provide safe homes, loving carers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is meant to provide all the necessary that was not provided in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal.
The specific features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and satisfactions.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighgmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audiences' responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that continue a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to ascertain whether an individual is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his speech, Oliver Sacks suggested that people who can't understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess openness.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behaviour can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the database of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination move back and forth between two poles with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult to brim with a digestive system similar to the one that humans have to satisfy its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Further, failure to do so has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and flakes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (mortgages, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide many proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Having considered everything, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors had solved their "protein problem" in the same little foreground as the chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of purposely waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into consciousness without being fully awakened.
If you find yourself replacing the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which we know to be diuretic) before sleeping, forcing someone to go for a drop of water.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates with the amount of tension in one's body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each individual has the potential to find peace and complete satisfaction.
Everyone is able to be enlightened. The only thing that hinders this is our own stubbornness and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was extended by the love path of mahaiana and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a complete love path.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and imagining.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Deity. Through the imagery of various deities the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are invigorated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to co-operation between the Soviet Union and the USA. With the end of the war it caused system, process and culture conflicts for the rival countries.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to continue for the next 40 years and would be truly fought, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish garrison was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian foothills.
However, these plans were almost overnight superseded, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Proliferation Treaty, and other international, bilateral as well as multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Naval work traditionally was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to invade Britain as it did in the rest of Europe.
Goats first appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds roaming on hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goat shepherds, who were usually children or young people, similar to the better-known shepherd. These methods of shepherding are still in use today.
wagon roads in England were built as early as the 16th Century.
Although wagon tracks consisted only of parallel planks of wood, they enabled horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the period.
Line slippers were introduced quite early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on the top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wheels of the wagon's wood.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron railings were introduced.
Walking was the first method of travel that we know of, humans began walking precisely two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning a backsliding man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus did not walk aground as often.
Bilateral specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce the suffering of the future to some extent.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we only want a temporary solution, then we should find out the root of the problems, and we should pacify them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and problems have become more due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of humanity.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
By nightfall between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap sheets".
The first public reading of this document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsheets known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original hand-written copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and are able to fly.
But there are many characteristics of birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs with lichens and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.
All computers in effect in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in the form of binary numbers.
There is only one of two values, that is 0 or 1, a binary number can have, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Perhaps the best sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or poisonous chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bugs is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term is derived from being familiar with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Murderer beetles and bed lice are colorless, adapted to live in a nest or their host's home.
Across the United States of America, there are around 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple Sclerosis is a disease affecting the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have Multiple Sclerosis than men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, or in their child's best interest, to bring up a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their rights as parents so that another couple can become parents to the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method leads most scientific research.
It is not alone however, experimentation, which is a test used to eliminate one or more possible theories, ask questions, and make observations, also informs scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinion was accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As understanding of the Greek declined, the West found itself divorced from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
A number of rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic suggestions, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free running checks even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey's and Chase's experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They carried out two experiments by either marking the DNA in the flask with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the flask with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material being affected and whether the affected cells are linear cells.
Mutations in linear cells can only be transmitted to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the views, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take pictures of, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the country in cars to go to their workplaces and they are passed by others who are going to their work destination in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation everyone is somehow associated with a transportation system based on private cars, and supports the system.
Now, science suggests that this massive carbon economy has hit the biosphere from one of its stable conditions that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you will rarely hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or falling bridges.
Why are transport systems incentivising such complaints, why are they failing every day? Are transport engineers ineligible? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two places and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic streams tend to have a degree of reasonable consistency and can be broadly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) intensity, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and implement road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insect that can't bend their wings back is the snake servant and fly May.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System was moving around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System was moving around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?
The Amason River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the largest river but one.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide at times.
20 percent complete discharge of the water flowing out of the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amason River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, Giza pyramids have never been surpassed in size or technical degree.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at the time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official correspondence.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican City are Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in innate form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, thought that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what you see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of substance. Every substance is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit into the full stop at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when she came out.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing emerge, the pencil is downgraded to smaller status and use.
Now people write messages on computer screens, without having to come close to a finder.
One can only guess what the keyboard will be when something more new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It is quite similar to rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to break off from each other with little or no pushing.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar objects on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adults.
These theories look at what makes certain people want what they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's Hierarchical Necessity Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can arise as managers begin to guide their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, performance assessments, determining responsibility, and holding people to account.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognisable individual who feels he or she has to change everything the team has been doing and take ownership for it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtualization teams are held to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their team may be meeting according to different time zones that their local managers may not understand.
The presence of an actual "invisible item" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an institution wish to go through the laborious process of setting up a learning institution? One goal for implementing institutional learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can become evident.
As a result, the process of organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as common knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum approach as a method that is used to help institutions achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. It therefore limits the field of research and makes it much more detailed.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and behaviour assists scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors have an impact on behavior and cause changes in certain mental operations.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and research brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although there is significance from science fiction to Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in a machine.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves making machines automate work that requires intelligent behavior.
Examples include management, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnosis and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the armed forces, as it has been built in several home computer apps and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. Quite often a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at artefacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with classes in the future.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina plan a website about their trip to the Province Capital, the website is remodeled every year, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blog experience with messy grammar and spelling, an audience’s presence changes that in general.
As students are often the most critical audience, the writer of the blog begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces pupils to become more informed about the world around them". The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires pupils to be competent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can "empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of other writings as well as outline their own views on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating, bilingual capital and includes a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada past and present.
Further south there is the Niagra Falls and the north is home to Muskoka's natural beauty and beyond untouched.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered completely Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost desolate with no one living in it.
For a comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent on its own in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or affiliated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the lands as well, and it gained a great place in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Peninsular Way from Europe to India.
In the north the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realise that cultural differences could lead to what they would consider harassment and that it's not uncommon to be followed, have your arm gripped, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century Before the Common Age, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and gave it the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading centers there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in the whole of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagging, pottery, leather goods, huccas, and a whole spectrum of jewelry, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by a eruption of Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the town's roads, especially the town centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that continues in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with tracking the Mountain gorillas which are among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda boda (motorbike taxi) to travel around Goma. The normal (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poorer town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites at risk, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main staying spots during Henry Louis Gates's PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is completely contrasted with other cities of the country, because it has more Arab or African instincts.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square km and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the main symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance and access fees for the Park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place where many tourists consider it their main hub.
The parade of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a bright bar chart that is made visible by the presence of the water of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon shores opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated intensively on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the place that the British settlers took as their property and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 miles) into the heartland of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove bogs however - they contain some of the last stands of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which a third is covered with water/marsh areas.
Since 1966 the Sundurbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife, and there are now an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those going east and Jakarta/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses between areas are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-fixed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group that lived in what is now East Paragwai, living as semi-rural hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes like the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, previously called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization, and continued for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paragwai has managed to retain much of her native character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be found here at other times of the year.
For news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) and its value is the same as the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank in the islands located in Stanley over the road to the FIC West store.
In general, British pounds will be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often accepted too.
On the outlying islands credit cards are likely not accepted, although British and U.S. money may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so you should exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold; temperatures rarely go below the freezing point, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: how much rain there is remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/metre from bears and wolves and 25 yards/metre from all other wild animals.
No matter how deep they may appear, wild oxen, ravens, elks, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they did not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so allow their space for them.
In addition, be aware that odours attract bears and other wildlife, so don't carry or cook foods that light up and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval disagreement in 1889 when seven German, US and British ships refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of the Tupua chief officer Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland occupies two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The whole is almost sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the richer suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with a good range of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The name of the other local beer is "Manta".
There are a number of French wines available, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "white flat" coffee is foreign. A short black one is "espresso", cappuccino comes loaded high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of those reef-related causes are rare.
However, you should take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found near river beaches and estuaries between October and April to the north of 1770. Occasionally they can be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks have a fear of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their main habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives the passenger peace of mind that she will have a place to sleep once they arrive at her destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to order other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even flight packages and hotels combined.
They are also able to keep the order for you if you need time to think about the offer or acquire other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, enquiries about any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those attending music festivals camp on site, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you'll have to get in early to have a campsite close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages is finished, remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
There are a number of campgrounds available for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in the winter, you should check the cabin location, as going through a row causes quite terrible noise for those who are most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the town. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to make the most of the time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings, to keep guests in a good mood, and keep them in the building.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgement, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone going to drive at high latitudes or over mountain gaps should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On snow-covered roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you're on bare asphalt.
During snow storms, there's plenty of snow to enslave you that can fall in a very short amount of time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by vapor or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, frost and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted typically throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in general usage refers to traveling over land to see the breathtaking wildlife of Africa, especially on savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, hunting leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
The walking safari (also called "over wild", "saffari hiking", or even "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place in other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between <0xC2><0xA5> 2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5> 130,000, with normal tickets costing about <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Humid cloth ironing can help to dry it out. Many hotels have ironing boards and ironing boards available to borrow, even if there is no one present in the room.
If there is no iron available, or you don't want to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to allow fabric to get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for a minute is enough, in other areas several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have a concern, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Passengers may come across pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause painful itching, or in the worse case cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Toll-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties at certain locations.
Travelers entering countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often crossing through an isolated rural landscape.
If you do not follow the rules of the land, then you will be left with no choice but to be a part of it, and you will be left with no choice but to be a part of it.
Posted speed limits are impressively lower than in previous and subsequent sections - 35-40 miles per hour is common (56-64 kilometres per hour) - and strict obedience to them is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely, though, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other sections of the road, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are abundant and varied, like those of their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastry cakes are common, with apples cooked into a crust all year round, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German baked goods include almonds, bearded nuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you have a desire for small but rich pastry cakes, try the ones called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Knapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a meal based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
Currants can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a huge variety of regional foods found throughout the nation.
But, if used without additional conditions, the term tends to mean the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely available throughout the archipelago now, Jafa's cooking method includes a collection of simply flavored dishes, the main flavors preferred by the Jafa people are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Jafa's cane sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Guards are supports to the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They offer more stability to the rider but may have safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but his foot is caught in the guardrail, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather saddle to fall off the saddle if it is withdrawn by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as Yosemite South America, with a variety of large granite walls and rocks.
Peaks feature spectacular views of mountain tops. Climbers from all over the world are continually establishing new routes among its endless potential of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and windsurfing, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered landscape with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "skiing enthusiasts", who plan a whole vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5000 B.C.!
Skiing down the hill as a sport dates back to at least the seventeenth century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as perched skiing, trip skiing or ski-hiking.
It is associated with but not including travel on alpine skis or mountaineering, the latter on steep terrain and requires much stronger skis and shoes.
Think of the ski trail as a similar walk.
In good conditions you can travel distances a lot more than walking - but you'll rarely get the speed of cross-country skiing without heavy backpacking in gruelling routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and managing passports a number of times.
The Schengen zone, however, works somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas to each Schengen member country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no general definition for what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be less in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than mass-produced similar goods.
Deer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture associated with the craft is also important to many who have other professions.
Nevertheless, even traditionally, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale deer husbandry, but have lived primarily from fishing, hunting and the like, and kept deer as towed animals.
Today a number of Sámi work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani, the word "gypsies" is considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perception of Romani people.
If the country you're visiting becomes subject to a travel consultation, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East could face different situations to Europeans or Arabs.
Advice documents are a brief summary of the political situation in just one country.
The views presented are often superficial, generalised and oversimplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Rough weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious disruption to society, or loss of human lives.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Powerful winds, hail, excessive wetness, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are lightning storms and thunder, tornados, water columns and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include thunderstorms, snow storms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as they may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search of the Internet for a "hostile environment course" is likely to offer the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually run from 2-5 days and will include role play, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the desert are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Passengers planning a foreign sex reassignment surgery must ensure that they carry valid documents for the journey home.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with undeclared sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally wide ranging.
Searches in security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Trans people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Bifor-meeting is the flow that comes back from waves breaking off the beach, often in a riff or something similar.
Due to the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper spots, and fast currents to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue whilst trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you come out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult or habit-forming.
Try to aim for somewhere where you're not yet caught, or, depending on your skills and if you've been spotted, you might want to wait for your rescue.
The shock of a second admission comes sooner than the shock of a culture (there is less the duration of a new slave), it lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who had an easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time adapting to their native culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the customs from your home culture.
When you went to a foreign country for the first time, people are probably patient and tolerant, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not foresee that patience and understanding is also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the children's area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
You usually hear the noise of tourists and vendors at all times. The story of noise and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
The views are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by a number of countries and possess the largest number of stations, with sixteen being operational in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 kilometres north of Penrhyn. The largest one is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where a still actively flooded volcano's callor provides a striking natural hazard.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Penrhyn Mountains join the plateau, then reappear to form the 360 kilometre Ellsworth Mountains chain, shared by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinsion massif, at its highest in Mount Vinson which is 4892 m.
In remote locations, without mobile phone reach, a satellite phone may be your only choice.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as voyages with data and voice needs remotely.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about contacting this service.
Travel and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a year away.
This is particularly popular among school leavers, enabling them to take a year out before going to university, without jeopardising their education.
In many cases, enrolling on a year-long course abroad can improve your chances of moving into higher education back in your home country.
There will usually be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, lakes and coastal inlets.
In the islands and lakes you don't necessarily need a sailing boat.
Although the coastal islands and largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national recreational activity in Finland, with boating for every seven or eight people.
This is rated by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands one to forty is the figure).
Most of the different Baltic Cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of days as well as return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you're only going to land using shipboard outings you won't need a separate visa (in 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the above map, Berlin is not near the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is not different from fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or on not having control.
Shipping companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Time is often very important with business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some roads, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other roads and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they had sent things by air transport, on some routes it might have taken days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as recorded luggage. The airline’s regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that’s where you become relevant.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to pay a large batch of money for the privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as approximate rules, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for a business, and eleven times for a first class!
In general, there is no purpose in even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge the appropriate fare.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
At one time in the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, well-developed and bustling commercial centre, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red tile roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more ambience comparable to traditional Mediterranean Europe than Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble statues of pigeons over some tombs.
It's worth an hour to wander around the city.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra which was made famous to foreigners after a commendable report of its splendors by Lord Byron.
Bus 403 Scotturb travels to Sintra regularly, staying at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Consecration), a world famous place for Mary's appearances.
Remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site that has an immeasurable meaning almost an immeasurable proportion of the world's population.
Many men and women still alive survived their time here, and many more had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Treat the site with all dignity, seriousness and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not touch the surface of the glass or rub the surface of the glass with a brush.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. About half speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and everyone effectively speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only shown in Catalan because it is established by law as the official first language.
Yet, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are published in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a bad reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just a wrong stereotype, the best way to get on in Paris is to be on your best behavior, behave like someone who is an "éléve baby" (well-bred). It will make moving around a lot easier.
The subtleties of the people of Paris will disappear quickly if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes national park is heavily forested, mostly with beech trees, spruce and pine, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a notable variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and woodpecker can be found there, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the mansion, women are required to wear skirts over the knees and have something over their shoulders, too.
Most of the monasteries provide cloaks for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colours, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same line, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed after each user so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all!
Food from Maiorca, like foods from similar zones in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and you (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available condiments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Each name, alongside the word Sie for you, begins each time with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It can also be argued that it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a nominative form.
Pronunciation is quite easy in Italian as most words are pronounced the exact way they are written.
The main letters to look out for are c and g, as the way they are pronounced varies depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means beloved, while caro means vehicle.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and consistent on the whole.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help you understand a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish are able to come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern watches are usually obsolete by today, and are used as museums, or education sites.
Since at-large light pollution was not a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Seeing the cherry blossom, or hanami, has been an element of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum flowers were a flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor would only hold the first cherry flower parties around the Imperial Court for himself and other members of the nobility.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "only one" specimen.
If you're visiting a formally organized garden, collecting "species" is also going to make you get thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is an exceptionally safe place to be in general and very easy to move around, and you can buy almost anything on arrival.
But from being located in the "high tides" a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with heat (due to the time) and strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, less often).
A few buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to take goes to Hebron and not only to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base your holiday on.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine valley or taking an expedition to interesting cities on the Danube or taking a boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, and it celebrates the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the holiday traditions are also followed by non-believers living in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is an award to spend the night of Easter waking in some open spot to see the dawn break.
There are Christian theological explanations for this tradition of course, but it could be a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil on a Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with the congregations often beginning to celebrate at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived in the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the large turtle the Galapagos' main grazing animal.
Since the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in the winter you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise higher than the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since the population of the areas is sparse, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to see the stars.
Japan's working culture is more hierarchical and formalized than what Westerners might be used to.
Suits are standard business clothes, and coworkers call each other by the names of their families or by job titles.
Solidarity in the workplace is essential, emphasising group effort rather than praising individual achievement.
Employees often have to obtain the approval of their head teachers for any decision they make, and are expected to obey the instructions of their head teachers unquestionably.
