I want to be rich.
I go to school every day.
Are you a Dixie?
Is that you?
Enemies are so.
I'm standing here.
I've seen a stinker in the zoo.
A thousand times.
Do you want to come?
Look, an abelia tree.
I want this thing Tom.
I'm pretty big.
In love ie in life.
I was wearing it like a girl.
All right?
I don't need any of that.
I lost my pen.
I haven't forgotten.
Where do you preach French?
I want a guitar.
What are you doing?
Good for you!

It's hot.
My book is on your desk.
Tell me what you want.
She is in private.
Tom did not know that Mary was able to speak French
You!
Look, it's an apricot tree.
He hasn't written the letter yet.
I spent the whole afternoon answering emails.
They were dying.
I like teaching.
It can't be.
This man is not a rat.
Tell me what you want.
Can I have a glass of wine?
They were gray.
Is he white?
Do you have a car?
A thousand friends.
D-Tom doesn't want to go in his father's direction.
I'm very big.
Welcome to Tatoeba!
Tom was talking.
Do you have a car?
Thanks.
I lost my badge.
Be very fruitful.
What is your address?
Who ate all the cookies?
I don't wait.
Do you like the black machine?
It wasn't a mistake.
Don't talk to me!
NAF, this is ridiculous.
He was very poor.
I'm never wrong.
Pres is on me.
She was dressed like a woman.
Is it still raining?
Be careful!
Inside, it's raining.
I wasn't my own person.
Don't leave me alone.
I didn't know.
My money was stolen from me either side.
The study of a foreign language is difficult.
Tom had a good prayer.
Tom would start.
Then there's a cat from under the writing table.
I came to one.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday are seven days of the week.
Are you jealous?
I don't leave my one-piece.
Give me the whole thing, please.
More coffee, please.
He was very poor.
Thanks!
There were a lot of people in the concert.
I'm hating on you good luck.
Tom went into love with the sweetheart of his best friend
NAF, it's so funny.
Me, I don't need anything.
Good night!
Look, a Japanese apricot tree!
I understand that.
Shut up.
I know you know.
Well, well.
Please answer.
He was pretending to be Tom.
He was talking to Tom.
Tom, I've seen you around.
Burj Khalifa is the tallest skyscraper in the world today.
Is that you?
I hope not.
Will you give me the whole thing?
I have bad news.
Tom sang.
There is no need to get lonely in any way.
I'll work on my one.
Bring the doorknob with you.
Where's the bathroom?
Have you met Tom?
It's raining in my heart.
Vagdalena enjoys agriculture.
That car is mine.
I have to go.
It's all about the war.
Look, an aserola tree.
We're teaching Welsh.
Tom wants this thing.
They're still losing.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I'm very worried that your father would be dead.
Well done, Yukina.
It's not strangling.
There are a lot of big hearts in Brazil.
The tongue is black.
I'm a sure case.
It's a song he sang.
I'm sure.
I'm excited.
Thank you!
The tongue is not white.
Look, a tree aches.
My father's not at home.
They'll be out of sight.

You can't eat here.
I need some advice.
It's Tokyo.
D-Tom doesn't want to go on being an inventor like his father.
I was attacked.
They lost again.
I've seen Tom face to face.
He was very poor.
A filter I've fished.
I like to travel.
I could actually call Tom to call the police if I wanted to.
Bars and circuses.
People are going home.
I'll continue.
I want a guitar.
Filled with filter is my watercolour
Are you jealous?
Be careful!
I'm sure I would have done something like this once.
Look at a lush-red tree.
Yes I am.
Sunflowers often set when I'm driving.
Tom is the only one who knows what really happened.
Thanks a lot.
Look, an acokantera tree.
Have you won?
I go to bed before midnight almost always.
Are you awake?
How much is it?
A fort gel is attenuated.
I live in rural Japan.
I'm not special.
NAF!
When were you born?
Tom plays rugby.
Sunday is the last day of the week.
I'll keep it.
This isn't my cat. My white one is scared
Look, a rose akasia tree.
How much is this watch?
The tongue is white.
I'm stupid.
I still have questions to raise with you.
Friends do things together.
It wasn't because I wanted to.
It's last.
I've seen him run.
It's cold.
Tom was not aware of the relationship between Mary and John.
I completely understand.
He's crestfallen.
I'll work on one.

Thanks a lot.
I see something.

Tom and win.
Tom I know very well.
Deal with this bar!
I prefer to stay.
I gotta go.
Who's that guy?
Thank you.
White bread, please.
A cat came from under the table.
You donâ€™t want to get carried away, do you?
Is she there?
You're beautiful.
Tom's a safari.
I remember them.
I'm a sure case.
I don't like it.
I'm not working.
I'm finished.
This film was a favorite of Dom and Vari both.
I don't speak Spanish.
If you have finished with the whole thing, please give it to me.
It hurts inside of me.
Do you eat meat?
Yes.
It's time to eat.
Pocketing one's smoker is like sticking a pot of soup.
It's gonna be inside my head.
I must finish my duties
Maybe something bad has happened?
Are you sisters?
I'm standing here.
Is it possible to get AIDS thanks to the seatbelts of the privates?
I want something sweet.
Where does the problem go?
My pen is gone.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
Do you have the money?
I'm not going to do that, I'd rather die.
I wasn't listening.
I knew you were.
Tom's arrival?
Just one language isn't enough.
Do you live in Paris?
Tell me what you want.
I'm an investigator.
I'm watching something.
Call the police.
They turned into fools.
Bread and games.
Tom does not believe Mary when she tells him that she loves him.
I'm very tired.
Tom was afraid we wouldn't understand French.
I don't speak Japanese.
I know you know.
I know you used to.
We're teaching Welsh.
'Ba' where do you speak French?
Tom is wearing a coat that is much too wide for him
He has a dog.
Of course I remember.
Or l<0xC3><0xA8>ge 'u<0xC3><0xA8> k<0xC3><0xA8>ve jam<0xC3><0xA8>s traoalh.

Are you jealous?
It was last again.
Invite for Paris.
I came in third.
You better not go.
I make no mistakes at all.
I'm very tired.
Thank you, my brothers.
'Ba' where in the French pretense?
He came to me!
Are you sure?
I heard him go outside.
I'm sorry I'm lost.
NAN, that's so funny.
A beer, please!
You took everything.
Who is this guy?
I have two gazes.
Look, an acacia tree.
Is it a douchebag?
I have kids.
The art just brings out the bar.
I don't have any towels.
He was too dynamite for me.
Do you speak Japanese?
I'm so h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-

I don't think that's a big mistake.
I don't think that's a big mistake.
I don't work.
God bless.
I know Tom very well.
Have you been to Paris yet?
I didn't take any showers.
I'm gonna work my ass off.
NAF, what?
I didn't listen.
Are you dizzy?
How much does a leg lift cost?
I didn't sleep.
Thank you so much!
I didn't take any showers.
I hate you dearly.
Have you seen a great link?
He's not Tom student, he's one of the teachers
I don't eat at home as often as I used to before.
Look, a giant adenium tree.
He was very poor.
Look, an agave.
How long is this clock?
Being soft offers at least a good quality - you expect a lot of camouflage.
Coffee az po?
I'm gonna take a down.
He was very poor.
Poaching one's smoke is like licking a lunatic.
Where do you speak French?
The sound of money is a familiar language in every country.
Friends do things together.
Stay home.
I'd like to know how to swim.
I'd rather die than be without Fadil.
I've come for my own.
NAF, it's so funny.
Tom frowned.
That's not a sentence.
Well done!
The car is blue.
He sang a song.
Look, an adenia tree.
Thank you!
It's big and it's beautiful.
I hope not.
She is reading.
There are two pages.
Thank you, Yukina.
He was very poor.
You're gonna make it inside your head.
There's no reason to be shocked.
Is it Tom?
I remember this thing.
They'll leave.
Still a cup of coffee, please.
You can just fuck with me.
Yes.
No, thank you.
Is that Tom?
Tell me what you want.
I'm sure you're saying no.
Something I see.
This sentence is not French.
The car is blue.
I'm going to work one.
"What time is it?" "Ten and a half hours."
They didn't run.
Safari was Tom's.
I don't know.
I need some advice.
You're sisters?
That's crazy.
He was very poor.
Tom was lonely.
What is Mount Everest?
I like teaching.
Do you like apples?
What is Monterrey?
There are a lot of anchors.
I wasn't sleeping.
They need friends.
Who ate all the cookies?
He was very poor.
I go to school every day.
Burj Khalifa is the tallest skyscraper in the world.
Tom's pregnant.
I'm an investigator.
Ruby plays Tom.
I know you won't talk to me.
They were dead.
It's hot today.
He was afraid of blacks.
This food is too salty.
I thought Tom was dead.
Is Tom meeting me?
Welcome to Tatoeba.
Thanks!
I'm turning what I want into what I want!
He was poor.
It rains.
Look, an ailing tree.
I'll try harder.
Enemies are so.
Is it possible to get AIDS thanks to the seatbelts of the privates?
