It is a concern of Welsh AMs ‘that they would look like tabs'
Some AMs have been outraged over the suggestion that their entitlement should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The outrage came as a result of plans to change the assembly's name to the Welsh Parliament.
The whole political spectrum is being re-introduced into the political landscape.
One AM told the Labour Party that his group was concerned "that he makes rhymes with Twp and Pwp"
A nod to readers from outside Wales: stupid and stupid means shit in Welsh.
AM told Plaid Cymru that the group as a whole was not "more than happy", and alternative proposals have been made.
One person told the Conservative Party that his group was broad-minded about the change in name, but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and ‘Muppet' in English.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced in the same way as the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the changes with the name, said: "It is of course up to MEPs to take the final decision on any reporters by name who will be known as MEPs."
The Assembly of Wales was given the power in The Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
The Commission published the results of a public consultation in June on the proposals which received widespread support for the assembly's designation as the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of AMs, the Members of the Welsh Parliament (WMP - Welsh Parliament Members) were the choice of the Commission, but the MWP option was the one that received the most support in a public consultation.
It appears that AMs are proposing alternatives, but the effort to come to any conclusion may be a real annoyance to the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The legislation under the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The final vote will be on who will be elected when the legislation is debated.
Today is the day for the people of Macedonia to vote in the referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will cast their vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
An agreement on the referendum was reached as part of an effort to resolve the decades-long dispute with bordering Greece, which also includes a province with the name Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is the same as a claim to its territory, with successive protests against their application for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the plebiscite about the change to the name, said he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, however, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change represents the price to be paid if membership of the EU and NATO is to be adopted.
St. Martin's Clock Silences and Church Fails in Harlem
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a chapel around every corner," Mr Adams said.
"You're not here today."
He said he understood the situation.
"People go out in different ways," he said.
"The bars in their sitting rooms are no longer for the public as people go on a regular basis."
For the churches, it's a concern that the money won't last from selling assets as long as leaders desire, "and they'll just be back where they started sooner or later."
The church could be replaced by apartment buildings, full of the kind of people who don't help the rest of the refuges in the neighbourhood.
"The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be bright-skinned people," he said, "and so they will speed up the full closure of these churches because it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these apartments will be members of these churches."
The two churches were built with communities with a bright amenity before Harlem became a major city for people with a blue amenity - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Modified community moved to a bright recess in the 1930s.
And the people of the land rejoiced, and the name of the LORD came to rest on them.
St. Martin's was taken over by a blue-cheek community under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against retailers at 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which was opposed to recruiting or raising people with blue-cheek in their rank.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but parishioners with Father Johnson commissioned the cloister when they planned reconstruction plans.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martain's, baptized the "bell of the footmen" on the cloister.
The expert who played the clover in July called it something else: a "cultural treasure" and "a historical musical instrument whose replicas could not be found."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first clique played by a blue-collar musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger clique at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's did not receive him a representative.
It was a complicated story between architects and contractors seen at St. Martin's over the past few months, on the lay leaders of some of whom introduced the church, while others introduced the episcopal diocese.
The bequest - the parish's own governing body - was written to the diocese in July regarding their concerns that "the diocese would seek to carry forward the costs" to the bequest, although the bequest was not related to the recruitment of the architects and contractors who had been sent in by the diocese.
Some of the people in the parish complained about the lack of clarity on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy is on the verge of drowning in California.
A 13-year-old boy shark was attacked and injured on Saturday while diving in search of a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster catch, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego, Chad Hammel said he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he crossed over there to help him get off the heel.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a bit of excitement from the birth of a lobster, and then realized "that it was a shout out!
We had a blast!"
"It's all coming together," Hammel said as he approached the boy.
"I'll let everyone shout out from the heel: 'There's a shark under the heel!'" said Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is classified as being in poor health.
It is not known which shark species was responsible for the attack.
Rescue Guard Captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was deemed not to be a dangerous shark species.
Giles told him that traumatic injuries to the victim were removed to the upper part of his body.
Officers closed down access to the beach between Ponto Beach in Casablad and Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles indicated that the 135 shark species in the area were larger, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to launch in the UK market.
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with their department store-style scheme passes and a team of special assistants.
The campaign is part of a significant disruption to the £2.8bn UK scheme market, which is still growing despite declining sales of fashion and household goods, which will test the larger scheme passages in 11 stores around the country, and will be brought to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in scenic goods comes as part of an effort by supermarkets to fill shelf space in their once-in-a-lifetime televisions, microwaves and household goods receipts.
Sainsbury's said they would be increasing the number of their scheme items twice offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current areas from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with branded areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up range, in such a way that the majority of products are customizable by vegans - requiring more young shoppers.
In addition, retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week; with the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, out this year.
The trends of online shopping and buying small amounts of food every day at local convenience stores are putting pressure on supermarkets to do more to attract people in.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said that the venues will gradually look like department stores as the series of stores try to recover from the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos locations in hundreds of stores, and also introduced some Habitats since they bought those two store sets two years ago, which they say boosted grocery sales and contributed to the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous supermarket attempt to radically renew its schematic and pharmacy sections failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots west in the early 2000s, but the connection was terminated after a dispute over how to share proceeds from the pharmacies in their supermarkets.
That new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.
They said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, but added a range of additions to the luxury smart care brands that would include La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have radically changed the appearance and appearance of schematic passages to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialist colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit all demands, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a world class scenic destination that challenges the old shopping route."
Peter Jones ‘unfair' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal
Peter Jones of Dragons was sacked after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time available for their brand of truly domestic goods and accessories.
The pair's business and Goop's brand have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow..
The 37-year-old presenter announced this morning on Instagram that she is to leave.
Holly Willoughby has put star Peter Jones of Dragons Den on a red carpet when she pulled back from her lucrative lifestyle business at the end - to focus on their major new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Our information sources said that Jones was ‘on red carpet' when the white girl of TV admitted during a meeting full of tension Tuesday at the headquarters of his inner business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she would no longer have enough time with her new markets - valued at £1.5 million - to focus on her brands of household goods and Truly tailors.
The business was compared to a Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was predicted that it would double the wealth of Willoughby estimated to be equivalent to £11 million.
With 37-year-old Willoughby announcing on Instagram that she was to depart from Truly, Jones boarded a jet out of Britain with one of his holiday homes as his goal.
The source of information said: "Truly the head of priorities for Holly was to her.
It would be a long-term future for her with which she would earn her living for decades to come.
Everyone involved in it was withdrawn with their decision to leave the market.
No one would have believed what was going on Tuesday, because it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise inside the Marlow HQ which is ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of presenter This Morning, which is one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the business millions due to the significant investment in cushion and candle products and clothing and household items, and further delays in its launch.
And it could end a friendship that lasted for several years.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past decade.
Truly was founded by Willoughby along with Capp West in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, came in as chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in television production firm Baldwin.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and take part in representing Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night "We would not comment on matters relating to his business."
"We fell in love and then we fell in love."
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the news media for the comment that would be "unpresidential" to the eyes of some, and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is it so hard for President Trump?
Trump said while pretending he was a "chief news presenter".
"I didn't see anything."
He noted that Kim expressed interest in the second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump announced as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have come to an end.
It was more than three months since a summit in Singapore in June when North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.S. General Assembly last Saturday that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's initial efforts towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted that SAM is still applying sanctions with the aim of keeping pressure on them.
Trump wasn't much of a fan of his.
"We're very excited about the North Coast," he said.
"We wanted to fight the war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
And now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had yielded positive results - the rocket tests were discontinued, they helped to free kidnappers and bring home the bodies of members of the American armed forces.
And he defended his unusual approach in how he talks about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be so presumptuous, but instead of having 10,000 people outside asking for admission to this crowded spot, 200 people would be standing right here," Trump said, referring to the crowd right in front of him.
Hundreds of people are killed on an island with a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
In the aftermath of the earthquake on Lombok, for example, the foreign NGOs were told that they did not need to be on the scene.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were sent from their own districts, no national disaster was announced, which was a precondition for generating the international aid.
"In many cases they have unfortunately said in vain that they do not want international assistance, so it is quite challenging," Mr. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together teams to travel to Palu, it's not yet certain if the foreign team can get to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman with the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the case in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
In view of the perceived earthquake in Indonesia on an ongoing basis, the preparations before the chaos of nature are a terrible one.
Although they are found in the Amazon rainforest, they are not found in any other habitat.
The apparent lack of a warning beacon before tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was in place, was likely a contribution to the number of lives lost.
Travel between the multi-ethnic Indonesian islands is challenging when it comes to hurricanes.
The logistics becomes much more complicated with the natural disasters.
A hospital ship based in Lombok for the treatment of the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, and it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the freshest disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put improvement to Indonesia's broken infrastructure at the heart of his electoral campaign, and has spent a large margin of money on roads and railways.
But funding shortfalls for Joko's administration led to him taking over his re-election the next year.
Mr Joko is also coming under pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as some people from the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes as clashes broke out between Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, with masses, bows and arrows, and other rough weapons.
Daniel Sturridge joins Liverpool in the semi-final against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the match against Chelsea in the Premier League with his score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 yards away from the barricade of Chelsea and his team to back 1-0.
He had the ball on his left foot before releasing an attempt with his left forehand pole.
The attempt flew high above the box as it approached the top right corner of the netting.
The ball caught just over the jump by Kepa Arrizabalaga in the end and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that place, get the ball going, and players like Shaq progress with as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante and gave the ball one small blow and didn't think about it as much as I did the effort on the back."
Chelsea were trailing 1-0 after finding a score in the 25th minute with Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The centre-back passed with his hand to the team in the blue jersey back as far as Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning from midfield and sprinting to bring Liverpool half of the pitch.
Kovacic gave a pass and quickly disappeared in the middle of the field.
He then released a beautiful pass through, which led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran over the defenders and brought the final blow into the net of the furthest pole from him with his left foot over Alisson Becker with the Liverpool team.
Liverpool will face Napoli at the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Indonesia's death toll from the earthquake and tsunamis has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people were reported to be stranded under the debris of buildings demolished by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit last Friday, with waves as high as 20 feet generated, as Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
The city of Palu with a population of 380,000 was full of debris from buildings that collapsed onto each other.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of the body of a woman in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The body of the 44-year-old woman was discovered at 7:55 a.m. with wounds inflicted on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder..
Police said they didn't see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'We are early in the investigation but I would appeal to anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have devised anything with their dashboard cameras to contact us as they may have information that would be critical to our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local woman in Birkenhead, and was found inside a property.
Friends of the woman believed to have been identified have come to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing as police have said they are currently informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police are telling him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was stunned when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be several hours before they are re-admitted.
One policeman was heard telling one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came up to him and opened the door.
She says it's "terrible."
There were two vans with the police within the protected line at 2pm, with one other van just outside it.
Several policemen were standing within the line of defense monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and log 247 on 30 September.
The Cromwellian statue inside the Parliament is the latest memorial to have been the subject of controversy over the ‘rewriting of history'
Their destruction would be a reward for their complete destruction, such as the Taliban, of many of England's religious cultural events at the hands of their fanatical followers or Puritans as they were baptized into.
The Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "an absurdity" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate over the removal of the statues would be expected to see the real Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster become a target.
He was not the one who ordered or made the slaughter in England's civil wars.
It is possible that Thomas's earlier actions may have led to a sacrifice of the wrong Cromwell.
The truly beautiful design by William Hamo Thorneycroft on Cromwell is evidence of speculation in the 19th century, and is part of the historiography of someone many people believe to be worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more so in the 19th century than today, would think of Cromwell as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in this case against the monarchy.
This is still a full-blown debate on the subject.
It is certain that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the development of our nation ever since, and it is an identifiable individual who represents one half of that divide.
It is also his duty as the Lord's Defender to celebrate and commemorate his achievements."
A farmer's wife is brutally beaten to death
A pig attacked and killed a farmer within a market in southwest Sin, according to local media reports.
The man with the surname ‘Yuan' was found dead with his artery cut, while he was soaked with blood near a pig's den at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post last Sunday.
A pig farmer preparing to inject vaccines in the pigs by pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province last Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
His cousin came to him the next morning while he was dead, and found that a door valve with a nearby pig's hooves had spread.
He said that there was a large male pig inside the enclosure with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550 pound pig was fiercely attacked or killed by the farmer, according to the report itself.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin with the surname ‘Wu,' as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Filming from the security camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about one hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not with Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so that it would not attack anyone else, with police gathering evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and the market authorities are engaged in compensatory negotiations for his death.
There are records in the annals of cases where pigs have attacked people although they are rare.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, and sustained critical injuries.
A decade earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds added a Welsh farmer to his tractor or his wife scared the animal away.
It was after pigs ate their farmer over in Oregon in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that it is not normal for pigs to be aggressive but a taste of the blood can function as a ‘chicken.'
"They just want to get away.
They treat you like animals, they don't treat you like animals, and they don't treat you like animals.
You have to show them respect," he said.
Heavy rain will come extensively to the southwest of the US from the remnants of Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening and moving it over the colder heel off the northern coast of Mexico.
The flooding with Rosa will only come from rain across northern Mexico and the south-west of the US in the next few days.
Winds of 85 miles per hour affected Rosa, which is a Category 1 Hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern Time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Roses are expected to move from the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a rift is forming over the Pacific Ocean and will move east towards the U.S. West Coast.As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Sunday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep north into the U.S. over the southwest.
Up to 10 inches of rain with Rosa will come to parts of Mexico next Monday.
Heavy rainfall will then be created extensively with the tropical moisture interacting with the trench approaching the South West for a few days.
Dangerous tusks, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert will cause between 1 inch and 4 inches of rain.
Deep, tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates reaching to 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to drop between 2 and 4 raindrops in parts of the Southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Flooding may occur with the conditions rapidly worsening due to the type of spread of the tropical rains.
He decided to go out into the desert to escape the heat of the desert.
The heavy rains may cause terrible flooding of the rivers in the estuaries, and local wind gusts and dust blown by the thunderstorms will come.
Some heavy rains will come with the clash approaching parts of California's southern coast.
The number of rainfalls may be above horizontal, which may generate minor monsoon flows and slippery roads accordingly.
This amount represented the first rain of its wet season by the region.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spread more widely in late Monday and next Tuesday.
God's wrath will be poured out on the four corners of the earth.
Sharp fluctuations in temperature in October can be seen throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, with the temperature zone remaining relatively warm.
As a result, changes in temperature occur over short periods of time.
A great example of the amazing temperature variations will be seen across the center of the USA on Sunday.
Temperatures will vary nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days the last heat of summer will try to rejuvenate.
October is predicted to see a warm start to much of the central and eastern US, with temperatures in the 80s widely over the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
80 degrees could be found in New York City on Tuesday, and 10 degrees would be in and out over the average temperature.
We are indicative of our long-term forecast that there will be a high probability for temperatures above average for the eastern half of the US through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people tuned in to watch Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched the fascinating evidence from nominee Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her, with the allegation that the assault, Christine Blasey Ford, occurred in the 1980s on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with the broadcasters breaking into regular programming for Friday's final round: an agreement negotiated with Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona for the FBI to conduct an investigation into the changes that would last one week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is one hundred percent sure that Kavanaugh strangled her while drunk, and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his testimony, claimed that he is one hundred percent sure that it did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported Nielsen on Friday.
That firm included the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks shown, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And some ducts for Nielsen tend to be measuring the number of people who look into the offices.
As a comparable measurement rod for that, the number of spectators is the same as for a qualified match in American football.
Fox News Channel, whose host commentators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was a frontrunner among the networks with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The demand was still high after the hearing.
It was at the heart of God's creation.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning receiving a meal treat from demonstrators as he attempted to take a lift to the Judicial Committee hearing.
He was standing with his eyes about him for several minutes while they were throwing past him, which was live-streamed on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
Someone once said, "You have the power, and very few women have the power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and told him that, before the lift was closed, he would have further to say at the committee hearing.
All the cable and broadcasting networks were covering matters hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote to put Kavanaugh's nomination forward to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which a minority of Democrats wanted.
It was his conversations with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, that urged Flake.
It was after a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards that Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice gained power, because it became clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve of Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case.
British Prime Minister May accuses his critics of conducting political games on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of engaging in "political games" about Britain's future and taking national interest in interviewing the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview near the top of the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson pushed forward his attack on his so-called Brexit plan, or Chequers plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the European Union would collect each other's tariffs would be "absolutely ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson over LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting, who was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and registered in prison with a second-grade cause of murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The officers released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police discovered the glasses from the scene and said they had found DNA with Simpson on them, as reported by WAFB, an affiliate of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted fatally shooting Wayde.
The bond was set for him at $350,000, which the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report last Friday, in which it was stated that a gunshot wound in the head and into the neck was the cause of death.
The section is identifying the Louisiana State Police task force on refugees, the state police crime laboratory, Southern University police and citizens of the area for assistance with the investigation coming to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement for "his diligence and determination to bring about justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge where his father Wayne also played basketball with LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game which he found last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that the team was "devastated" and "devastated" by Wayde's death.
"It's a matter of trust," Wade said.
Ash from a volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ashes have erupted from the Popocatepetl volcano after coming down from southern areas of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned the people of Mexico on Saturday to stay clear of the volcano after the activity increased inside the crater, and it registered 183 gas and ash emissions in a 24-hour period.
The centre was monitoring multiple tornadoes and tremors.
The images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the automotive windscreens in areas of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) away southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September of 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
There were clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence demonstrators and riot police, with thousands taking part in rival demonstrations to mark the one-year anniversary of Catalonia's split vote.
Rad a group of separatists with pebbles on them laid eggs and cast powdered paint on the riot police who held them back, creating a cloud of dark dust in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Police were called to the scene and the police were using their weapons to stop the violence.
They were in favour of independence by chanting "Forgive no one, Forgive no one" directly in front of unionist demonstrators shouting "Go to Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the demonstrations, the local press reported.
The tensions are still high in the region where a desire for independence is found to exist one year after the October 1 referendum considered by Madrid to be illegal, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose to be independent with a high majority, although the percentage coming out with a boycott was low the vote was among the largest opposition to the separation.
According to the Catalan authorities nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the vote at polling stations across the region with violent clashes there.
The decision was made in the wake of a protest in support of the national police.
The demonstration went on, but they had to find a different way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician attending the separatists' demonstration with his wife said he no longer had hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
"It was one of the best times we've ever had.
I saw my parents crying with astonishment that they could vote, but we're stuck now," he said.
Despite the fact that Catalan parties in favour of independence would have found a crucial victory if it had only been necessary in the regional elections last December, they have been unable to maintain that continuity this year with many of their easily recognisable leaders in exile on their own terms or have been remanded in detention awaiting their trial for their role in organising the referendum and the resulting declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on her phone, said it was the politicians from both sides who sustained the conflict.
"The tension is rising relentlessly," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before his trial since the end of last year, announced that he would be competing in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Competing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to criticise the reversal in the democratic values and the oppression from the Spanish government," he said.
Man arrested after being hit by car in his home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a house was repossessed by a car in Derry City.
The incident occurred on Cedartown Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A crossbow may also have been released to the car at some point.
Menga's score gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal was for Livingston to save the win.
Livingston had an unexpected spectacular win over Rangers, and it was Steven Gerrard's second loss in his 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's score was the difference in the end as Gary Holt's team equalised with Hibernian in second place.
He leaves Gerrard's team without a win away from home in the Premier League the season facing Hearts, and they are eight points behind them, next Sunday.
Rangers will be at home previously against Rapid Wien in the Europa League next Thursday.
Livingston meanwhile adds to his number of games without losing to six games, and head coach Holt remains unbeatable since he took over from Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston doesn't score chances against balmy visitors
Holt's team should have advanced well before they scored, and his direct method for Rangers encountered many difficulties.
Scott Robinson broke through the defensive line towards the back but put his effort across the mouth of the back, and then Alan Lithgow could only put his effort into receivers after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett's headbutt across the back.
The home team were happy to allow Rangers to play in front of them, with the knowledge that they would damage the visitors away from home with the fixed items.
And that was the way the plot was laid out.
Rangers gave Livingston a free kick and created half chances, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson playing together to give Menga a chance, who removed the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
Rangers were in control of the ball possession by then, but they were unable to defeat the home team defenders and Liam Kelly's bartender,
That story was continued out into the second half, though Kelly had to make a save from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor closed the door on Scott Pittman and Lithgow gave Lithgow a flick in receivers from another fixed point with Livingston.
Passes across entered Livingston's box continuously and were cleared, and two demands for a kick were denied - following Halkett's challenge to deputy Glenn Middleton, and one on handling.
"Unbelievable" by Livingston
Alasdair Lamont with BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Very good product and service for Houston.
All of them were better than this, and all of them were in the wrong.
Their playing style and personnel have changed little since their return to the main division, but Holt must be highly praised for how he has inspired the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was excellent, overseeing the re-organised defenders, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their backs from start to finish.
Unprecedented pressure from the Rangers.
Although they sometimes gave great proofs about Gerrard, they came very close to those standards.
They were missing the last pass - they only broke through the home team once - and it's kind of eye-opening for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Welcome to Erdogan's headquarters in Cologne
Smiling and blue skies were seen on Saturday (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day with President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - intended to repair relations between the NATO allies.
They were successful on a number of issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then proceeded to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The largest population outside Turkey itself is found in that city.
The police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000 crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came out nearby to watch their president.
The voice of hundreds of demonstrators was also heard against Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - as they sharply criticized Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The confrontational protests are a reflection of the visitor's partiality, being worshipped as a hero by some German Turks and harshly criticized as an autocrat by some others.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist dies after being hit by a car
A cyclist has died in a collision with an inner London car.
The crash occurred near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford, in the southwest of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics attended the scene, but the man died there.
The crash comes several months after another rider died in a hit and run accident on Childers Street, about one mile away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and to contact his next of kin.
There are closed roads and bus diversions, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Prison Ship Lartin: Six officers injured during an analgesic
Six prison officers have been injured during a confrontation at the men's high security car park, the Prison Office said.
The anomaly at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire occurred around 09:30 BST Sunday and is still ongoing.
"Tornado" officers and specialists were introduced to combat the confrontation, involving eight detainees and limited to one platoon.
The officers were treated for minor injuries to their face at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "A specialist prison team has been deployed to combat an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate the violence in our prisons, and we are determined that those responsible will be brought before the police and that they can be re-arrested."
HMP Long Lartin contains more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
It was reported in June that the governor of the prison received medical treatment in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And riot officers were called in last October to tackle a serious confrontation in which the team was attacked with ball bearings.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floodgates (which could be a benefit for drought-stricken areas)
Arizona is rarely faced with a tropical depression, but that is likely to happen early next week with the remnants of Hurricane Rosa's energy centering over the Southwest Desert, with flood-prone fronts at risk.
The National Weather Service issued turkey sightings for Monday and Tuesday of western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Pheonix on Tuesday, and will be raining towards Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix stated in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained their tropical storm or weakening status within 200 miles of Pheonix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center projected 2 inches to 4 inches of rain, with discrete sizes of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert including Central Rockies and The Great Basin will appear to have 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and isolated totals of up to 4 inches may occur.
For those who are out of the risk of tulka now, Rosa rain could be a blessing because there is drought in the region.
While flooding is a serious concern, some of that rain may be beneficial as drought is currently in a part of the South West.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, over 40 percent of Arizona, the second-highest category, is at least severely dry," reported weather.com.
First of all, Hurricane Rosa passes across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is reaching colder waters in the Pacific Ocean so it has lost power.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm evening or Monday night.
The rainfall across parts of Mexico could be heavy, and there is a significant risk of flooding as a result.
"Irrigation totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California into northwest Sonora, and could be with 10 inches," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then go north across Mexico as a tropical storm before coming along the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rainfall in California, northeastern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert," says the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening thunderstorms and debris flows, and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted suicide
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after finding a 16-year-old boy stabbed several times in Somerset.
The teenaged boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he is in ‘stable' condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, say Avon and Somerset Police.
Officials are appealing to anyone who may have had a piece of mobile phone footage of what happened to them.
Trump said about Kavanaugh, that he ‘suffered, granularity, anger' of the Democratic Party
"Justice Kavanaugh's vote is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered granularity, and anger" of the Democratic Party during this nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, and strongly and emotionally denied an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegation.
The President said on Saturday that Kavanaugh had "saw Americans of high eminence and quality and bravery" that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most empowered legal minds of our time, a jurist with an outstanding public service record," he told a crowd of West Virginia followers.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of a Republican ballot in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, and I'm really running", he said.
"That is why I am all over the place fighting for great candidates."
Trump said he was "deliberately refusing and obstructing the process."
The first procedural vote on the Senate floor regarding Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership special counsel told CNN.
The earthquake has killed hundreds, Indonesian tsunamis and the number of killed is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, and many people were swept away with large waves crashing the beaches, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres (18 feet) crashed on the shore at nightfall, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying nothing in their way.
The earthquake was caused by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the threat of the tsunami arose yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away and thus were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, BNPB, in an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it came with cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, saying the tsunami traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the edgeboard.
Some of the people came out of their homes and ran away, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 locations in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, complex and broken bridges and a mosque and water around it.
Followed by post-revolutions with the coastal city to vibrate Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the major earthquake on Friday amounted to about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that was cast on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long narrow harbour, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, a hospital, a shopping mall and a hotel had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found stuck under the debris of the collapsed buildings, he said, and said that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coastlines 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area known as Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said "there was no information at all in the messages" from Donggala.
About 300, 000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, saying its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become more", she said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not providing the information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said waves came in within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film footage on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard as he is terrified by the approaching tsunamis that hit the people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water engulfs the shore, bringing with it buildings and cars.
The trailer for the film was not immediately confirmed.
A major power cut occurred as a result of the earthquake and tsunami that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army began to launch a cargo plane with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but food and other basic necessities are still badly needed on evacuations.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Pallu on Sunday.
The number of people killed in Indonesia's tsunamis has exceeded 800.
It's all very bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely to the city of Palu, where employees are housed in tarpaulin shelters created in the courtyard of their office, they went over a devastation along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's all bad.
Even with aid groups beginning the relief work, many complained that some foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being blocked from traveling to Palu.
According to Palu regulations, regulations, funding, supplies and staffing will not flow from abroad until a disaster site is declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"But it's still a provincial-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'O.K. this is a national disaster,' we can open for international assistance but there is still no status.
As the second night in Palu fell in the aftermath of the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of those still missing still had hope that their loved ones would become miracles that make the grim realities of natural disasters lighter.
On Saturday, a little boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been stuck in debris for two days and her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandagi also said that some of the others stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel were students of his.
"As a junior in the para-flooding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paranormal community, he sent a WhatsApp message to Palu's rivals, who were taking part in the beach festival, as he went off his power pole with concern.
But his messages resulted in only a single grey tick, rather than a pair of blue ticks.
"I don't think that's going to change the rules," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM refills at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink worker refilling the ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department news release.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment centre and making ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the issue.
When he was busy, "another man ran from the back of a Brink employee" and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspicious people leaving the scene, according to the release, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about who they are should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap musician changes his name to Ye
Rap star Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He wrote on Twitter: "The man who used to be known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time now and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his arrival on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
It will be on the show in her place Ariana Grande who cancelled her arrival at the show on "emotional reasons", said the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current professional name, West previously stated that the word had religious significance to him.
I believe ‘ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,'" West said earlier this year, when discussing the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
We are you, we are you, we are you.
He changed from Kayne, meaning the only one, to Ye - which is a direct expression of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, of all things.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of rap musicians with their name changed.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former co-worker of West's, JAY-Z performed without a hyphen and without large letters as well.
AMLO Mexico pledges not to use the weapon against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the army to suppress the people of Mexico."
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration at the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooting across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said it was because of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities that youth are attracted to criminal gangs.
A.I. funding should be increased twice
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in that area, said AI researcher and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who once worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even where the U.S. does not have a formal overall AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be in 1st place in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget of AI research, given that every other country is much further behind than the US, and we're looking for the next discovery in AI," Lee said.
Increasing the funding twice would also double the chances of the next major AI discovery in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that won the Othello player the highest ranked Americans, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch of China.
Lee has acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporate companies," Lee said.
Leaders from universities working on AI in recent years are employed by Facebook, Google and other technologies companies.
Lee said that changes in migration policy could help the U.S. boost AI efforts as well.
"I think a green card should automatically be offered to PhDs in AI," Lee said.
The State Council of China issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people at academic institutions like the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, involving partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an Intelligence Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million in AI research.
In the meantime, the past few months have seen no action in U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether or not to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether or not to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a deal that would settle a decades-long dispute with Greece that had prevented their bids for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, insists that its neighbor's name on the north represents a claim to its territory and prohibited its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments made a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist combative spouses argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether or not the number of people voting will reach the 50 percent required so that the referendum is valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was as follows: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is well worth it to watch for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for us all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not binding by law, many members of parliament have said they will stick to the outcome of the vote to make it definitive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would require the name change.
The state's election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the most recent parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote for the referendum in Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018 on changing the country's name to pave the way for its participation in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small platform and was pulling up chairs in front of a tent built by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are not in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to take membership with pride, and not through the service door" said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and be part of the European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will provide much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe a very large majority will be in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that voting would be "in favor" of "declaring our future."
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the number of voters needed.
In another plebiscite, conducted by the Telma Television of Macedonia, 57 of the respondents were found to have planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be successful, 50 per cent must vote plus one vote.
The referendum would be the first serious defeat for pro-Western government policy since it took over control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero's Manchester City makes his way through Brighton's entire defenders for a back-to-back
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat the Brighton defenders in a 2-0 victory in Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's score in the 65th minute all seemed very easy.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass at the centre of the pitch at the start of the series.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before cutting into the open field.
There were then four green shirts around Aguero.
He pushed around one defender before running over a few other defenders on the edge of Brighton's box.
He then pushed a pass to his left, reaching for Sterling.
England's forwards used their first contact in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan to beat in on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about putting it to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
"We were very close to closing it at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the starting advantage in the Premier League clash.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero found the ball deep in Brighton's ground on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few contacts before leading Sterling to the pole over.
The Sky Blues' frontman hit the ball into the net before it slipped over a boundary.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler for the Rockies
With the Nationals having been knocked out of the casting match, there wasn't much reason to foresee another start.
But a constantly competitive Scherzer expects to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but if there are casting game implications for the Rockies alone, who are ahead of one game over the Angeles Dodgers in W.L. West.
The Rockies won at least a special invitational place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to win a title in the first division.
"While we are playing without justification, at least we will be able to put our foot in the three-game series knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver will be with the crowd and the other team would be playing at probably the highest level of any point I would face this year.
Why wouldn't we want to participate?"
A starter is yet to be announced by the Nationals for Saturday, but they are said to usually let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, wore a practice loca session Thursday and would be pitching on his usual Sunday break.
Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the case regarding his choice in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh speaking about the importance of a Republican ballot in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be in danger in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big things -- I'm not running but I'm really running and that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump then said, "You see this ugly, ugly, radical group, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to bring back the power by using all necessary means, you see the granularity, the suspense.
They don't care who they hurt, who they set out to gain power and control, that's what they need, power and control, we won't give them that."
The Democrats' mission is to "deny and block the course."
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, "making Democrats angry and ugly and depraved and depraved."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by classifying Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein with her name, and the resulting loud applause from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you get the document.
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for one - that body sign was seriously bad all along - the worst body sign I've ever seen."
The Labour Party and the Church are no longer separate.
Don't listen to those who speak
Although the Momentum activists in my local party voted to criticise me, it was no surprise.
After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour Party Members who have been told we're not welcome - that's all because we spoke out.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated almost the same because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the resolution criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, questions, ironically, with which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive."
For the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MEP, that was exactly how meetings were held on Friday.
Sadly today, that's not the atmosphere in many of the meetings and the promise of "kinder, milder" politics has long since been forgotten if it ever really began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that there is no acceptance of different views in the Labour party and all views are considered on whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party or not.
That started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues I had previously thought of had a similar political outlook in the hope that I would change radically and take positions that I would never agree to - whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and whatever I say - there's going to be an outpouring of mistreatment on social media calling for deselection, criticizing the politics of the center, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that's not just my experiences.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I'm focused on are usually about politics.
I'm fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to put up with the rigors of sexual or racial abuse every day without backing up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the way in which levels of maltreatment are now being accepted.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should build a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are not that broad church anymore and with all "mistrust" resolutions or a change in selection rules the party is becoming narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years recommending not to draw attention to myself, not to speak out as much and then I'd be "okay."
But I didn't have the strength to do that.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, which was motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had left my comprehensive school classroom falling to the ground domestically, I have sought to campaign for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my policy position and areas that I disagreed with regarding the current leadership.
For those who put forward the resolution on Friday, the only thing I would say is that when the country is ploughing for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But in reality my message is not just about Nottingham Momentum, but it is about my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that the threats of disqualification or political trickery will not stop me from acting in a manner in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr not to be won
It may have been the end result of a few mishaps, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this day's highly entertaining Tenants' Division game.
They are now at the top of the table, the only team out of ten not to win.
In the end, it was their excellent defence, as well as the way they took chances, that helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been trying over our games so far, but we haven't won yet, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Our praise to Ayr, they took better chances than we took."
Grant Anderson's in the 14th minute, which Frazier Climo saved, put Ayr ahead, but, due to a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the match, Melrose were able to take advantage of the nets and Jason Baggot will take the incapacitated goalkeeper.
Climo signed Ayr's front with a penalty kick, before, just at half time, he scored and then saved a bounce from foot to hand to make it 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and with a dribble by Patrick Anderson, who saved Baggot, the gap was reduced to five points.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was taken from the pitch on a stretcher, and from the restart, Ayr pushed forward a flood through Stafford McDowall, who saved Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again, Melrose forced the extra man to pay off with Bruce Colvine's inflated hud at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking Climo without the ball, from reaching out the penalty kick, MacPherson grounded at the back of Ayr's forwards's clutch.
Climo, as he had been doing since the restart almost tilted, after Kyle Rowe collected a high kick over David Armstrong's shoulder and sent home goaltender Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth.
It looks like it's going to be a game changer in the gaming industry.
It looks like Still Game's star Ford Kiernan will be moving to the hospitality industry after finding out that he was named the director of a licensed restaurant company.
Ford has the part of 56-year-old Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill and with whom he co-stars.
The two announced that their upcoming ninth series will be the final one during the show, and it looks like Kiernan is planning a life-changing after Craiglang.
According to official records lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make a statement about the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun gave a nod that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade."
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia hopes landlocked court reopens way to Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters equipped with rigs in La Paz.
A blue ocean flag is flown on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are smeared with the slogan: "The sea is ours from the right.
It has to be returned."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of its coastlines lost against Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains elusive - as well as the prospect of launching on the Pacific once again.
That hope has been the greatest hope for decades, with Bolivia awaiting a ruling from the international court of justice on October 1 after a five-year discussion.
"Poland has momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course it looks forward to the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be looking at CBI control on large screens across the country, with the courage that the tribunal in The Hague will be in favour of Bolivia's demand - following turbulent talks over the past decades - that Chile be obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's incumbent president - facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - is also heavily dependent on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favor - and her decision in her favor would be little changed.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the Chilean territory, and has ordered that it not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the CBI ruling comes exactly six months after hearing the final arguments indicated "that the case was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Shilling expert in international law.
And not only was Bolivia's cause put forward, but it may have been put to the rear in the last four years.
"Bolivia's current administration has taken possession of the issue of access to the sea", Zárate said.
The aggressive propaganda of Morales has tripped up any goodwill that would have been left by Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold a discussion hereafter.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was more trapping than it usually is.
It will be a "wonderful opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" on Monday and a chance to "end the 139-year disagreements by mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political aide.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific", he added.
"It's important for us to be able to see that we're breaking the law."
He also said that nuclear weapons will not be used if the country does not have a nuclear capability.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has said his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it doesn't have confidence in Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to take action in accordance with his word on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival spouses.
His comments come as it appears that U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is about to resume cease-fire nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "dream" that continued sanctions and a refusal by the US to declare an end to the North Korean War would never lead to a deadlock.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang takes the first significant disarmament measures.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump would like to have another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is really about denying an armistice that the country sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show showcases the latest line in massive headpieces that are on the way to a Major Street near you
If you want to make your hat collection bigger or completely block out the sun there is no longer a need to search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a huge range of headgear for their SS19 collection on the display platform which was influenced by the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
A lot of very impractical hats were being displayed around Instagram this summer and those designers put their incredible works on the manicure platform.
The prominent Valentino piece features an oversized beaded hat with a broad leaf-like feathers that hollowed out the manicured heads.
Other huge accessories included watermelons that had jewelry, a magician's hat and even a pineapple - but aren't designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also revealed a strange mask selection in time for November.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than were with haute couture.
One had works such as scuba equipment, snorkels and swimming glasses with him, while others were similar to melted ice cream cones.
And if you follow the mass fashion statement-you're lucky.
Stylistic observers have predicted that the massive bonnets may be making their way to the major streets near you.
The giant hats come shortly after "La Bomba," the straw hat with a two-foot-wide leaf that was seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that was being displayed across social media has added another big work to the manicure scene - a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the manicure on which the bathing suit is carrying it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, which had a French raffia dressing and white leather straps, was the prominent piece in the SS19 collection Jacquemus' La Riviera Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm expecting big hats and beach bags to come to the big street for next summer - since the designer had so much influence it would be hard to ignore the huge adaptations."
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a further series of outstanding examination results, which have been strengthened by the success of individuals and all peoples together in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30, 000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector where we can design and implement a customised school curriculum, we are seeing the rise of modern languages as a desirable subject choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart."
That is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English if we want to build relationships with and trust people from other countries.
From the most recent examination results this year, we find that languages are top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved an A grade of Honours.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS membership schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved Grade A Honours in Mandarin, and 72 percent who studied German, 69 percent who studied French and 63 percent who studied Spanish also achieved Grade A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now viewed as a choice of subject, as are STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for employers' reasons for having difficulty filling vacancies, 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore language skills are increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession one would choose, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future that they have a lifelong skill similar to this one.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically promote a multilingual person to the competition.
According to YouGov's survey of more than 4, 000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and the only language that a two-digit percentage of them spoke was French, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language teaching.
If children have more than one language, especially those in developing economies, they will be more likely to find meaningful employment.
Different languages will be taught in each school within Scotland.
Some schools will focus on contemporary and classical languages, while other schools will teach the languages that are considered to be the most important languages for the UK looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with specialist teaching staff in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is undeniable at this time that, in a global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, languages should actually be viewed as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
I need to be well looked after.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will play his first Lakers game in San Diego on Sunday.
LeBron James is set to play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes it will play has yet to be decided.
"It will be more than one minute and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website".
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans with a Lakers six-week preseason schedule".
"There are no pre-season games at this point in my career that I need to prepare for," he said.
Trump's mobilization time in West Virginia, You Tube channel
President Donald Trump begins a number of rallies tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five mobilizations over the coming week, including stops in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to retain his pick for the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump plans to gain support for the midterm elections because Republicans risk losing control of the Federal Parliament, when votes cast on November 2.
What's going to happen to Trump's campaign and how can he be trusted?
Trump's rally at Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
A look at Trump's rally in West Virginia can be viewed live online on You Tube.
Trump is likely to speak at the hearings regarding Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Supreme Court, who has been charged with sexual misconduct. The Senate confirmation vote has been postponed for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main aim of the series of rallies in the coming week is to help Republicans, facing intense rivalries, speed up their campaign.
So, President Trump's campaign indicated that these five mobilizations over the coming week were aimed at "encouraging the volunteers and supporters to protect and increase their pride in the Senate and House of Commons," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so essential to his program that the president visits as many states as he can, as the busy campaign season unfolds," a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not sign, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally is set to be at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get publicity from the media in Pittsburgh," according to Metro News, West Virginia.
Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 points in 2016, for the second time in a month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has to come to try to boost his lead in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia university, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 Team USA shows a desire to be optimistic ahead of Sunday's singles rounds.
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's quarterfinal match may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum of the moment is a made-up sporting concept, but the players believe strongly in it, especially at competitions like this.
So, where's the momentum now, according to them?
"They were six points ahead and now it's reduced to four points, so I'd say we have a little bit of momentum," Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage that is four points ahead and twelve still to play.
Americans are optimistic, though, and have a lot of reason to be optimistic, especially because Spieth and Justin Thomas are playing well, together, throughout the day and can argue that they won three points out of four.
Spieth is playing great from the house to the lawn and is giving a good example.
The celebration's scornful cheers got higher as the round went on; it found necessary hits to win game four, when he and Thomas were two to end after two holes.
The game was won at 15 and the cheers were let go, the kind that tells you that the American team has not lost the tournament.
"You have to keep your courage and focus on your own game," Spieth said.
That's what's left of each player now.
18 holes to go.
The two players, who have more points than Spieth and Thomas, over the past two days have gone round are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood and this is the great story of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair have won four out of four, which is odd but delightful and can do nothing that is wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only pair who didn't hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys, on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and the second nine holes on Friday morning.
The flawless game they played and the way they get the energy from the loud audience show that both are the players who need to win on Sunday; and no player would be smarter to achieve a European victory under the sun at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be better if both of them win the match at the same time, but at different holes.
But it's too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did not take long to get Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in the four-ball, and Alex Noren, his partner, the Spaniards and Swedes were stuck in a hole and could not escape.
The Spaniards and Swedes were stuck in a hole and could not escape from it after receiving bogeys and doubles in the front nine holes.
On Sunday, however, no one is going to help you escape from a hole that you yourself are stuck in.
The four-ball and the four-ball are so attractive, if they are looked at closely, because of the interaction between the two players, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way in which a strategy changes in the blink of an eye.
Europe played better as a team to this point and have dominated well going into the final day, but this fourth-quarter game showed a desire to fight on Team USA, although some people doubted it, especially in the United States.
Europe are ahead 10-6 at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a good advantage at the start of the Ryder Cup final day after all four balls and the four-goal game, when they were ahead of the United States 10-6.
The exciting duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, dominated the conflict when they had two wins over struggling Tiger Woods, to reach four points to that point at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to win the cup, which they lost to Hazeltine two years ago again, had the hand in a lopsided draw against a failing American team, in the four balls, leaving the series at 3-1.
The four of them turned to look at each other, but the two of them were unable to speak.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's singles matches to retain the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European greenwasher to win four consecutive points and he and Molinari, who was baptized ‘Molliwood' after a great week's end, are the second pair to win four points in the first four starts in Ryder Cup history.
They had a big win over Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls and played both as a unit to win over Woods, who was weak-willed, and Bryson Dechambeau with an even better win, with 5 and 4.
Woods who struggled in two games on Saturday, showed up very often but has now lost 19 out of 29 games, which he has played, in all four balls and in all four games and he has now lost seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose took a break when the four balls ran in the morning and played again with his partner, Henrik Stenson, in the quarterfinals and a 2 and 1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is certain to be the world's first and third golfers.
However, it was not easy for Europe, in a pleasant day, to wind south-west from Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the major championships three times, and Justin Thomas, set the standard for the Americans when they won by two points on Saturday.
They earned the win convincingly against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the four balls, although they lost the first two holes.
It only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team came back from a four-point deficit in the single tournament, although Furyk's team only needed to be on a combined score to hold the cup, as they won the cup last year.
However, after being in second place for two days, they are unlikely to be able to counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says that there is no ‘no chance' that they will unilaterally disarm because of lack of confidence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that ongoing sanctions were aggravating their lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons, unilaterally, in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had shown "very good will" during the past year, insofar as it halted nuclear tests and missile tests, built the nuclear test site consecutively and pledged not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't have the same response from the United States," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States, our national security will not be trusted and in these circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm, first and foremost."
While Ri again made popular complaints to North Korea regarding the United States, which opposed a "progressive" approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be given a concession, as it took small steps, her statement seemed important in that it did not reject a net of unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President, still in office, and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work "to achieve nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula" while Trump made a promise about North Korea's security.
North Korea wants an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must surrender its nuclear weapons in advance.
Washington has also resisted requests to ease severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists that "nuclear disarmament will be done first and foremost" and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve their aim in a coercive manner, and even opposes "notice of the war being over", Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can overwhelm us is an idea from people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that sanctions, which are continuing, are contributing to our lack of confidence.
Ri made no reference to another summit being between Kim and Trump, mentioned by the American leader at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If South Korea rather than the United States were the party involved in this issue of nuclear disarmament, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be thrust in this way."
However, the way in which Ri spoke in his speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed to the US mainland after Trump, "Mr. Evil President", "rocket man" on a suicide mission to call Kim.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, even though he threatened last year to "totally destroy" North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't mean a certain time for disarmament, saying, "if it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should compensate Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State with the United Nations Security Council said on Thursday that: "Security Council sanctions must be applied robustly and without any failure until full nuclear disarmament is achieved and certified."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go too well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made; but North Korea criticized him within a few hours because he had "made claims about how to cheat."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy a missile site, if the United States took "corresponding measures."
He said Kim told him that his "corresponding measures" were security promises that Trump had made in Singapore and taking steps to achieve normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest.
A new course has started at Harvard University this year to increase sleep for all undergraduates to counteract the growing culture of what is being studied' through the night with the aid of caffeine."
A student discovered that students at the university, which is in the first place in the world, have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, put the course together, believing it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
‘At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said: ‘Why haven’t I been told this already, in my senior year?’
"She said no one had told her before about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the key points about good sleep habits and how they contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's medical services, said the university took a decision to introduce the course, when he found that students were very lack of sleep during the week.
A series of interactive tasks are part of the hour-long course.
In one section, there is an image of a dormitory, where students knock on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books to respond to the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic functioning and the importance of a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are told how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons, urges the participants to reflect on their daily routine.
‘We know that it will not change student behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - how you would have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still a culture of pride in ‘staying awake during the night’, he said. According to him, modern technology and the pressure on students, which is constantly increasing, means that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
A student should ensure that he/she has sufficient sleep of good quality as a ‘secret tool', he/she said, to avoid stress, fatigue and anxiety, even to avoid weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in hunger mode, as he/she is regularly hungry.
Raymond So, 19, from California, who is studying chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having done one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and urged him to look for a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all undergraduates to do a similar program of study, before entering the competitive institution.
The Professor suggested that students should set an alarm at bedtime, as well as an alarm at waking up time and be aware of the negative effects of ‘blue light' coming from electronic screens and LED lights which can disrupt your daily rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's back-to-back win over Gerrard
Rangers lost again after defeating Steven Gerrard 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox team were looking to get their first win away from home, since they won 4-1 at St Johnstone in February. But they were beaten by Gary Holt's team, Gerrard's second out of 18 games as manager. As a result, Gerrard's team are eight points behind Hearts, the team that dominates the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit the back seven minutes before half-time and there was no likelihood that Rangers, who were lacking in inspiration, would manage to score.
As long as Rangers fall to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third and there is only a difference of the backs between them.
Rangers could face further trouble, after the line-up man, Calum Spence, was allegedly treated for a head injury from some matter thrown from the side of the home crowd.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that easily won at Ayr to secure a place in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept the same 11 players, who had taken a point from Hearts the previous week and would be delighted with the way in which his well-trained team had respected the opponent's spouse.
It may have been a little too much for the Rangers, but Livingston was more concerned with the possession they got.
Livingston should have scored after two minutes, when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pitman, who gave Allan McGregor a kick towards the back but went on to foreclose.
Keegan Jacobs took a free-kick which went to captain Craig Halkett but his defence partner Alan Lithgow didn't manage to kick it but put it on for good.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed like they had hope rather than faith in the type of play they were playing, in the last third of the game.
It is certain that Alfredo Morelos thought he had earned a kick after a quarter of an hour, when he struck against Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson did not accept Columbia's man's petition.
Rangers managed to put just two kicks towards the back but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no trouble defeating Lassana Coulibaly's headbutt and a weak kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Although they may have had a Livi kick in the 34th minute against the playing patron, there is no denying that they didn't deserve it because they had made a great effort.
Again Rangers failed to deal with a fixed item in the starters from Jacobs.
Scot Arfield didn't answer for a pass from Declan Gallagher to Scott Robinson, who stayed calm and handed a pass to Menga, who put it in the back.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change had an immediate impact as he sent a pass to Morelos, who struck him towards the back but Kelly, who had a super-game, hurled it from his line to overcome the ball.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play the kind of game they like, and Lithgow and Halkett continued to beat the ball up the pitch several times.
Holt's team may have had an extra score towards the end of the game but McGregor stepped up well to overcome Jacobs and gave Lithgow a breakthrough blow from a corner kick that went foray.
Rangers' representative, Glenn Middleton, had a late claim to a jack-of-all-trades when he had a confrontation with Jacobs but again, Thomson, the referee, looked in the opposite direction.
Almanag: Geiger Counter Promoter.
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today.....the day a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery from which the device known as the Geiger Counter was made.
In the 1950s, there was a film starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. Although not expected, they were as scientists in the film:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that occur as a result of the radioactivity released from the minerals."
He said, "Yes, he's dead now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before her 63rd birthday.
But the invention that is named out of it is still there.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see' rogue cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see' rogue cells and kill them.
A vaccine instructs the immune system to identify rogue cells as part of treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then ‘see' a protein that is common in many cancers and then they are reinjected.
A trial vaccine is showing optimistic results in patients, who have different types of cancer.
For one woman who received treatment for the vaccine, who teaches the immune system how to recognize rogue cells, the ovarian cancer disappeared altogether for 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see' protein, which is common in many types of cancer, and is known as HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings indicate that we have a vaccine that we are very hopeful about."
"Some types of cancer" due to HER2 die, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancers and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach worked, in which immune cells were taken from patients and "taught" how to target cancer cells for the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West began to skits for Trump, while wearing a MAGA Hat after being on SNL.
It didn't go well for him.
Kanye West was beaten in the studio after Saturday Night Live after giving a release demo in which he praised the United States and President Donald Trump, who would stand for office in 2020.
When he sang the third song called Ghost Town, he was wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat, began to complain against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk like that to a white person who says: 1. How could you love Trump, who is not a racist?
"If I had to guess, I'd say I'm from the United States," he said.
SNL began the show with a magical sketch by Matt Damon, in which a Holywood star joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual assault allegations, made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it didn't air, comedian Chris Rock uploaded a Kanye West joke on social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to joke about West with the posting.
He also complained to the audience that he was being harassed in the backstage about the headgear he was wearing.
"They put me on the spot.
They said: ‘don’t go out there with that hat on you.’
They've been bugging me!
And then, they say I'm rather low," according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the low place?" he said "it would put a Superman cap on it because that means you can't give me an order. Do you want the world to move on?
Try to find love."
He was beaten at least twice because of what he said and it seemed that staff were being humiliated, Variety reported; one person told the magazine; "The whole studio was quiet."
West was called to the program as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-star, rap musician Mac Miller, died a few days before.
West put many people through a demo of the song ‘I Love it' dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West was supported in a tweet by the head of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner: "To one of the most courageous individuals: Thank you for standing up against the evil forces."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that Kanye West "is what it is and that's just great."
"But I choose not to compensate a person (to buy his music or to support his "art") who, I think, is accepting and proclaiming an ideology that harms my own community.
It's free.
"We are too," he sighed.
Before the show, the rap musician announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that his now official name was Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rap musician, Snoop Dog, has borne the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the famous musician, the late Prince, has symbolically changed his name and then to the artist already known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 40-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in Belfast.
The incident occurred in the town of Hacamar, which police have announced.
The defendant is expected to appear before the District Court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutions will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star, Kit Harington, attacks a poisoned mansion.
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval fantasy series ‘Game of Thrones’.
But the actor, who is 31 years old, criticized stereotypes of the fearsome hero, stating that such on-screen parts mean that young boys often think that they have to be hard in order to be appreciated.
Speaking to ‘Sunday Times Culture', Kit stated that he believes that ‘something has gone wrong' and questioned how to deal with the problem of poison husbandry in the era of the <0xE2><0x99><0xAF>MeToo.
Kit, who married his co-star on Game of Thrones, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, also, recently, admitted to feeling 'strong' when it comes to dealing with the issue.
‘Personally, I feel very strongly at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?’ he said.
‘What teaching did we teach men when they were growing up, in terms of the problems we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be responsible, to a certain extent, for the increase in the malevolence of poison, thanks in part to the extremely malevolent characters.
He continued: What is native and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, it informs young boys that they need to be sure before they grow up.
I think that's one of the big questions - how do we change that?
It's clear that something has gone wrong."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be taking part in prequels or follow-up stories, when the series ends next summer, stating that ‘there are no more battlefields and horses from him'.
From November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently hinted that he thought the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was that he had met his wife, Rose.
‘I met my wife on this show and, so, he gave me my children and my future life,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whose character, Jon Snow, fell in love with her in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the lawn of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say the disease has infected more than 820,000 in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were announced in the second half of 2018 alone.
Most new cases were spread through sex, a change from the previous scenario.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China, due to infection blood transfusions.
But there is a huge decrease in the number of people getting HIV like this and, hardly anyone is getting it like this now, Chinese medical officials in Yunnan province have said.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000.
It is a difficult issue in China's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community to spread HIV through sex.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies find that 70%-90% of men, who have sex with men, will eventually marry women.
Much of the spread of the disease occurs from sexual protection, which is deficient in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to have full availability of HIV medication to try to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked the GOP senators' data and criticizes ‘dangerous lies and conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters criticized allegations on Saturday that a member of her own staff leaked personal information about three Republican senators in the United States or that the staff member posted the information on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat indicated that the information was being promoted by commentators from the ‘right-wing' and by web sites.
"False lies, lies and more ugly lies" Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch both of whom come from Utah were reported to have home addresses and phone numbers.
The information was made available online on Thursday. An unknown person on Capitol Hill was arrested while a Senate panel was examining allegations of sexual misconduct, attributed to the perpetrator, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak of information was made available sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identified that the source of the posts was related to Waters' office" and that the information regarding a member of Waters' staff reported by the Hill was provided.
"This allegation is completely false," Waters continued.
The staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been provided as a result of these allegations, which are fraudulent and false - has not been responsible in any way for the leak of this information.
This allegation, which is unfounded, is completely untrue."
Waters's statement was immediately criticised online, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's a shame," Fleischer said.
This implies that she does not have a fit temperament to become a Member of Congress.
When something is attributed to someone he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It should not be challenging.
He should not question the prosecutor's reasons.
He should be calm and relaxed.
Fleischer was apparently comparing Waters's response to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro is standing in the election to win Waters' seat in the midterm elections; he also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's a big deal, if it's true," he said.
In his statement, Waters said that her office "has informed the relevant authorities and agencies of the law about the fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that those guilty," she continued, "are exposed and held accountable for their actions, which are indelible and dangerous to all members of my team."
Johnny English is in business again - a parody of Rowan Atkinson's espionage with little effect.
It is now traditional to see the importance of Brexit in any new film of British bias and this seems to be the case in this revival of the Johnny English franchise, which is about parody of an action in comic form. It began in 2003 with Johnny English and started snagging again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will there be self-awareness with the language in the plot, in terms of how terrible we are, as a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any event, Johnny English has once again received a licence from the bulbous eyes to mess things up, his name being a comic character created for those who attend the cinema in non-English speaking countries.
It's, of course, the secret, shabby, rising agent who thinks he's attractive, but who, like Clouseau, is a mix of Mr Bean and the person who provided one note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
It is based from the beginning on the traveler and the international man, a mysterious man whom Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV ads, but who is now forgotten in what he left behind in his tumultuous past.
There are a few good points in this article, the most recent one.
I really enjoyed Johnny English as he walks towards the helicopter as he is dressed in the cathédrale of a medieval knight and the rotors pounding against his helmet at one point.
Atkinson's win for the body comedy is evident, but the comedy is truly weak and redundant, especially because "really" movie brands like James Bond and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as part of the films.
It looks like the comedy is aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's pathetic misadventures aren't as fresh and focused as the comedy is in the form of Mr. Bean in soundless films of Atkinson.
The bottom line is that there is a big problem.
A cyber-hacker has slipped into the secret web of British spies and leaked the names of British agents. This infuriates the on-duty agent - a very small part, unfortunately, for Kevin Eldon.
It's a devastating blow to a prime minister, a serious one, who's under pressure; he's already faced a complete breakdown of public decency: Emma Thompson does her best with the character, who looks like Teresa-May, but there's not much to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that each spy's name has leaked and that she must find someone, who has resigned.
And this is ineffective Johnny English. He is employed, at the moment, rather elegantly, but he is giving classes, in a secretive manner, about how to be a secret agent. There is some comedy here as English's offer is to provide a Roc-Cheoil type spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency information session and meets up again with his old partner, Bough, who is once again replaced by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a commander of a submarine, a small mercenary part, of whom Vicki Pepperdine is excessive.
So Batman and Robin, who get everything wrong in the Queen's Secret Service, are back in action.They meet Ophelia Bulletova, an attractive, beautiful woman, who was played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being groomed by a tech-savvy billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems. Jason Volta is a malicious person and Jake Lacy takes the part.
English and Bough embark on a fun and pleasurable journey: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a gorgeous French restaurant; secretly create a tolling wheel as they board Volta's magical yacht; English creates an anomaly, when he attempts to use a virtual reality headset to enter Volta's house.
They do their best for the final paragraph, but while it's sexy and lively, the whole thing looks like children's television.
Matter moderate enough.
And as with other Johnny English lde films, the idea ran through me: can the British film industry give a part to Rowan Atkinson, which matches his ability?
The Labour Party denies that it is planning a four-day working week for British workers but that they will have to pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan, in which Britons will work for four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party is reported to want the leaders of the companies to give money, which they will save through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IS), to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
The workers would have a three-day weekend - but they would still have the same pay.
Sources said that the idea ‘unfit' for the party's economic programme and their plans to change the country in favour of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions has agreed to the four-day work week as a way for the workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
‘It won't happen overnight, but a goal is a four-day work week, suited to the party's approach to giving the worker and the party's industrial strategy an advantage.'
The Labour Party is not the first group to agree with that idea, given the Green Party's four-day working week during the campaign in the 2017 General Election.
The Labour Party, in general, does not currently agree with the goal, however.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: ‘The party's policy is not a four-day working week and the party is not being considered.'
The Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference to illustrate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power from ‘anonymous directors' and ‘profit makers' at utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in the water companies will not get their full share as the Labour government could take ‘deductions', given that something out of the way had been done.
It also confirmed plans to give places to workers on company boards and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds and to give 10 per cent of shares in the company to employees, who have a chance of receiving annual dividends of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy says with "60 Minutes" whether or not the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court has been delayed by at least a week, due to the FBI's inquiry into allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. It raises the question of whether the bureau's decision and whether Republican senators could change their minds and deprive the Judge of support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday on "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley's correspondent of Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI could obtain any information that would change their minds about him.
Kennedy seemed to have a more open mind than his South Carolina counterparts.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"As I'm entering the hearing, I said, 'I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.'
I would call him after this happened, after the allegation came out and asked him: ‘Have you done it?’
He was strong, determined, he didn't put a tooth in it."
It seems, however, that Graham's vote is definite.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a serious allegation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
But not everyone can name it.
It is 36 years old.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the World Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizen Festival, an annual event, in which well-known stars are taking part and a particularly important mission is also at hand: to end global poverty.
This is the seventh year of the World Citizen Festival and thousands of people will be flocking to the Grand Green in Central Park to enjoy musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to highlight the event's definite aim of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, which began in 2012 and is an international advocacy effort to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To receive free tickets to the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket) concertgoers had to do some tasks, or "acts" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or using any other sound way to spread information about their goal to end poverty.
How long has it been since the World Citizen and 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is it a real way to give people a free concert as a gift to encourage them to take action, or is it another example of "the click" - people pretending to be making a real difference when they sign up for an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, The Global Citizen says it has a record of over 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who want to advance various goals.
He says these actions have helped spur world leaders to make promises and promote policies worth more than $37 billion that are going to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, at least $10 billion has been donated or collected as part of a fundraising activity.
The group estimates that the money that has been received, already, has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the globe.
The Power of Nutrition is a partnership for investors and people who implement it. It is based in the United Kingdom. It is committed to "helping children to develop their resources in accordance with their potential" and promises to provide a total of $35 million to end malnutrition in the country after receiving 4700 tweets from Global.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and World Citizens like yourself, we can end the social injustice that is in malnutrition" Tracy Ullman, ambassador of Nutrition Power, told the crowd during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken, which called on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a fund for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will help 5 million women and children to engage in nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on the website, which asks the question "why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen replied: "There will be a long, difficult road ahead - from time to time, we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements of civil rights and anti-segregation we face, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Among the musicians taking part in this year’s event in New York are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe and will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to "implode" to block Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can use the Navy "if necessary" to stop Russian energy from being on sale in the markets, including the Middle East, according to U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that what Russia is doing in Syria, where it is operating with an invitation from the legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to make an arrangement about energy like they do in Eastern Europe, the weakest part of Europe, which is what he has said according to his report.
And, according to the official, there are always ways to deal with it.
"The United States, with the Navy, has the potential to make sure that the sea lanes are kept open, and if necessary, to put a blockade on, to make sure that their energy will not be available in the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to those present at the event, which was hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance.The Alliance is a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach, when dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that it is the same.
The economic choice of Iran and Russia is, to a large extent, to influence and transform fuels", he said, referring to Russia as the "bones of no trick" that relied heavily on fossil fuels.
The remarks come as the Trump government is on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including President Donald Trump, try to urge Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and, in Trump's view, make Moscow's "hoax" of Berlin.
Moscow has often said that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is one economic project that costs $11 billion. It will increase the capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes it, due to economic reasons and that it is an example of unequal competition.
"I believe we agree on the conclusion that fuel cannot be used as a tool to put pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after his meeting with the US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
Germany's reaction to the U.S. position came, Germany has reaffirmed that it will continue the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Confederation of Industry (CTG) has called on the United States to stay away from European Union energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Confederation of Industries (CTG) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will look "Carefully" at competing for the Presidency in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday she would look "very carefully" at whether to contest the presidency in the wake of the midterm elections.
During a meeting in the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider competing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to properly put the government that is broken and include then a woman in charge," she said according to ‘The Hill'.
After 6 November, I will look carefully at competing for the presidency."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall, saying he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about the effect of Donald Trump on our democracy," she said.
Warren Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, have been publicly criticized.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "we definitely need an investigation by the FBI before we vote."
A poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of voters in Warren's polling district think she should not compete in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to a poll by the Political Research Center of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported her to stand in the election.
The poll showed that the former governor, Deval Patrick, had more support, with 38 per cent supporting him to stand and 48% against.
Among the Democrats, who were hotly debated on standing for the presidency in 2020, were former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (NSI), which is at Palin's Track, mobilizing for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested by police on Monday night and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"My own son has been suffering since coming back and I can understand the difficulties other families are having with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.I understand the injury to soldiers who return as they are being affected by the disease," she told the audience mobilizing for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called "what no one wants to talk about" regarding his arrest and said of her son and other former soldiers of war, "they return and they differ, they are hard, they return and they doubt whether the public appreciates what their fellow soldiers and airmen and all other members of the army have done, what they have done for their homeland."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assaulting a woman for domestic violence, tampering with a family violence report and possession of a gun while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states support the new asylum policy challenge.
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge against the new U.S. policy, which refuses to give asylum to victims, z who are fleeing from gang-related violence or family violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a complaint in the brief of a court friend in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker, who was facing the policy challenge, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name was not mentioned in the lawsuit, Grace Against Sessions, initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang," abused her but U.S. officials refused to accept her request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state's attorneys, who supported Grace, said El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom seek asylum in the United States, were nations that had widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed the 2014 decision, made by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants, fleeing domestic violence, to seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "makes an indifference of decades of state law, federal law, and international law."
According to federal law, all claims for asylum must be assessed on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and the existing ban impinges on that principle," the court's friend brief said.
Further arguments were made by attorneys that the policy, which banned immigrants, harmed the U.S. economy; they stated that there was a greater chance that they would be entrepreneurs and that "they would provide a workforce that was necessary."
The Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered asylum judges to no longer give refuge to victims, who were fleeing family abuse and gang violence, in June.
"Sessions are open to those who leave their home countries, either because of harassment or fear regarding race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political views," Sessions said in his statement about the policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to solve every problem - even every serious problem - faced by everyday people around the world.
Despite the tremendous efforts made in Palu, the number of dead increases twice in the existing race to reach survivors.
The story was becoming increasingly terrible for people who survived.
"I feel the tension," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while comforting her little boy, who had a fever, at an evacuation center in the land-burning city of Palu.
"Every minute a car patient brings corpses in.
There is no clean water."
It was seen by settlers returning to their homes, which had been destroyed, as they were porching through flooded personal belongings; they wanted nothing, available, to be saved.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, which had been destroyed from the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to deal with it.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, whose back and shoulder were broken, were allowed to rest outside Palu Army Hospital where patients were being treated, as powerful aftershocks were still continuing.
The tears were with him as he spoke of the terrible earthquake, which shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to protect ourselves.
I feel crushed into the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then everything was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and her baby.
I hope they're safe and healthy."
The US ambassador accuses China of bullying with ‘promotional announcements.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page advertisement in a daily newspaper in the United States, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the supplement in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa - on which the China Daily paid for it - after he accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the US elections showed a new stage in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to use advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington have been caught up in a trade war, which is currently on the rise and, as a result, have both imposed tariffs on their imports.
China imposed counter-measure tariffs early in the trade war to beat a hit against a state such as Iowa, which has supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former governor of Iowa, who exports dozens of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China is "using that bullying by putting promotional ads in cheap American newspapers" Branstad wrote in an article that expressed his views in the Des Moines Register Sunday newspaper.
"The Chinese government is using the American tradition that our press is allowed speech and freedom to spread its propaganda, when it puts ads, which it pays for in the Des Moines Register.
"In contrast, you will not hear many dissenting voices at the news stand down street here in Beijing.You will not see the differing views that the Chinese public may have regarding China's economic policy, which is confrontational, since the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He continued: "One of China's major newspapers abstained from an offer to publish its article," although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are pushing Women Voters from the front door of the Midterm Elections With Kavanaugh Case, according to Analysts.
As many prominent Republicans stand aside while defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a reaction, particularly from women during the upcoming midterm elections.
People are very upset about this and the majority of Republicans have already said that they want to go ahead with a vote.
"These matters cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University with ‘The Hill' for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (Republican- Arizona), who at the last minute tried to get an FBI audit to satisfy angry voters, would be enough.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning the chant "November is coming!" was heard by protesters as they marched into the Senate hall. The Republicans, in control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to move on with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who reported Mic. 2.
There will be a drastic increase in Democratic enthusiasm and it will give them a lot of motivation," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying that it's high, already; that's true.
But it may be higher, especially among women who are between two councils, in the suburbs and younger voters, people aged between 18 and 29 who do not like the President but do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which showed her allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts claimed there could be a reaction, if Republicans continued to advance to confirm the nominee.
"This is a mess that's up against the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanagh is appointed to the bench or not, it's about the way Republicans have dealt with this and the way they've dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
But, it seems that there is a split between Americans, which of the two they will believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony and a few more believe Kavanaugh.
A new poll shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or almost entirely believe Ford's testimony and 35 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony fully or almost entirely.
Also, 38 percent of them said they believed, in whole or in part, that Kavanaugh told lies in his testimony while 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure put by Flake, the FBI is investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on oath last week that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while under the influence of alcohol, when she was seventeen years old.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court nominee revealed her genitals, when they were present at a party at the time they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The person who devised the World Wide Web has plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is set to start a new initiative, which will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the famous technologist, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where they will store their data, and who is allowed to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated, with humor, that the desire behind Inrupt is a "global domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the initiative.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to "create their personal, online data warehouse" or create a POD.
It can contain contact details, lists of things to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on a single browser and all are available at the same time.
The unique feature of the online personal data warehouse is that it is solely a user's responsibility to give access to a person, who needs a specific type of information.
The company offers :"personal empowerment through data." on it.
the idea for Inrupt, according to Chief Executive, John Bruce, is to provide appropriate resources, processes and skills so that Solid is available to everyone.
Currently the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers on the team, who have a contract to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team weren't talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where the business models they have are turned upside down overnight.
"We're not looking for permission."
In a posting on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission was to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem, to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network, which is built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past several months, a voice, influential in the debate about internet neutrality, has been in Berners-Lee.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Institute for Open Data.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of the internet," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebrates a clerk who won the Victoria Cross in World War 1.
His hometown has been celebrated as a clerk in the Church of England, the only clerk to win the Victoria Cross during World War 1 as a fighter.
The award was won by Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest award in the British army.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann said it was a "wonderful symbolism" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years since his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette of 28 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through heavy fog and under heavy attack from field guns and machine guns."
He later speeded up to the shooters' line and with "excellent courage" guided the line forward before raiding a field gun alone and knocking out three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on 4 October 1918 - a month before the end of World War I.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never have done but something that goes to my heart in me."
He and his brother, Doctor James Vann laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt it was a great honour to take part in the parade" and also said that the support that many people will give was showing courage that showed real heroism.
IMMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206 but, instead, they found Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've stayed sitting all night to watch Bellator 206, which is packed to the brim but you don't manage to watch the main event.
There were 13 fights on the fights list from San Jose, six on the main list and it was shown in a live broadcast through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory Mac Donald were preparing to fight each other, a stagnation was felt from audiences in the UK when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people weren't too impressed after staying seated until early morning to see the fight.
One follower gave a "promise" of the change to children's cartoons on Twitter.
"It's a government regulation that the program didn't fit and, as such, they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator, which led marketing and communications, when questioned about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Muck, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker said they will be working on the schedule to provide coverage for future UK audiences.
"I feel like when I think about the re-fight we can work it out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to work this out until the time here on Sunday and then on Monday.
But we want to fix it.
Believe me, when the program changed over there, there were a lot of texts going wrong and over and over and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not a government issue.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We'll settle for five rounds rather than six - as we usually do - and we've tried to provide the trailers with too much and gone too far.
It is a terrible situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘desperate' as a result of his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt he wasn't as good as others when he was growing up because of his sexuality - but that encouraged him to make progress.
The 24-year-old says he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "everyone wasn't like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, which was presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said that if he had been a parent now it was not so important for him to win in the Olympics.
The show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
While on Laverne's first program as a person on a deserted island, Daley stated that he viewed himself as "less human" than everyone else, when he was growing up as "not socially accepted as one would like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, it's those feelings that make me look at myself as someone who was smaller and felt different, those are the definite things that have given me the power and the strength to be able to achieve things."
He wanted to prove that it was worth ‘something', he said, so as not to disappoint everyone, when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a pro-LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) campaigner. He has used his presence at the British Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without any implication and wanted to give "hope" to others.
Daley, who was a three-time world champion, said he was "shocked" when he fell in love with American man-made filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him last year but said there was never a problem when it comes to the gap between the ages.
"When you suffer so much at a very young age" - he first went to the Olympics, when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find one of his peers who had so much above in his life.
The couple have been parents since June. They have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that "the whole outlook on life" had changed.
"If you ask me last year what was important, it was all about ‘winning a gold medal'," he said.
"Do you know, things are more important than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, when he was found to have brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the starting row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you won’t be around to be in the first series, Dad,’” he said.
"I had a hand hold on him when he stopped breathing and I didn't admit it was not conclusive until he stopped breathing and he was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that was my dream all my life - diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there couldn't be a better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which impressed him in the preparations for the Olympics and still gets him excited.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not performing properly on the substitutes bench in the Ryder Cup was sent off on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will reach the top spot on Sunday when he plays in a Ryder Cup game for the 47th time, but he will need to improve his play if he wants it to not be a dismal occasion for him.
Jim Furyk, the captain, sent Mickelson to the substitutes' bench for four-ball and four-quarter games on Saturday, while Mickelson was playing in the biennial tournament for the 12th time, a top-flight fixture.
Despite being in the midfield, as he had often been for the United States, Mickelson, who had won five major championships, divided his time as a proposed goaltender and practiced his playing on the field in the hope that he could solve whatever problems were bothering him.
He was never able to hit the ball directly, even when he was at the top of his range, the 48-year-old player is not at all suited to a narrow Le Golf National course, where the long roughness, on a regular basis, makes for stray beats.
And if the course itself isn't difficult enough, Mickelson, in his ninth match on Sunday, will be competing with British Open champion Francesco Molinari, whose first year of play has seen him partner Tommy Fleetwood and who has won all four matches this week.
If the Americans have a good start, which is four points to a finish at the start of the 12th singles match, Mickelson's game could be extremely important.
Furyk revealed that he trusted him, but couldn't say much else.
"He fully understood the part he played here today, he gave me a recommendation and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very confident of himself.
He is a person who has achieved a great reputation in the past, and he added that to these teams in the past, and for this week.
I'm guessing I didn't make it through two rounds.
I dreamed more, but that's the way it worked out and we thought that was the direction we were going to move.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most games played on Sunday.
He could end up pointing to a realm that was never as good as his personal record.
Mickelson has won 18 times, 20 of which he lost and seven of which he shared, although Furyk said there were some intangible things for the team because of its existence.
"He's funny, sarcastic, good-natured, he likes to tease people and he's a great person in the team room," he explained.
"I think the young players were really bummed out, too, this week, which was funny to see.
It's more than available."
Thomas Bjorn understands that a large surplus can go unclaimed.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows from his own experience that a good over at the start of the last day of singles matches in the Ryder Cup can create a difficult day.
The Danish first played in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under her captain, Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans but barely won with the smallest gap between them, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a big surplus at Valderrama; we had a big surplus at Brookline, where we lost and at Valderrama, when we bombed, but barely," said Bjorn, who is pictured after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and again yesterday to be ahead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will tell me and everyone that this is not around.
First post of the morning.
Go out there and do the right things.
This is not about the points on the board.
We have a goal and that is to win this cup, and then stay the focus.
I've said before, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know very well who are on the other side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn was delighted about the way in which his players played and said: "I wouldn't lean too much into it.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow is about the way each individual player creates and there is something different to do there.
It's great to be out there with a partner, when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then a complete trial of your potential as a golfer who's out there.
That's the message you have to apply to the players, which is to play on top of your abilities tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind you and they have to play at the top of their abilities, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk overhears his players being able to play better as solo players than they played with their partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who gained three points out of four.
Furyk has experienced both results of a major change on the last day before being a member of the winning team at Brookline and then being a member of the losing team, when Europe achieved the "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every word of it," he said in response when asked about Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, and how he incited his players at the start of the final day.
"We've got 12 important games tomorrow but you want to start well as you've seen at Brookline and at Medinah.
When that energy passes on to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the games in the middle of members.
"We're going to go out there and we're going to do what we know we're going to do, you know, tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with showing dominance in the coming backfield and is opposed by Rory McIlroy in the main game and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans in the first half of the day.
"I went with this guy's group because I think they'll be good for the whole day," Bjorn said of his selections for the singles matches.
The German warship is again postponed.
The German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War warships, but it won't happen until next year, due to a faulty system and the increasing cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the new frigates of Baden-Wuerttemberg has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, mentioned by a military spokesman.
The ship should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but there were major post-delivery problems that seriously hampered the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
It has been suggested that they will contain a powerful cannon, a combination of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as telecommunications technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are longer maintenance periods - it may be possible to deploy the newest frigates for two years away from home ports.
But, because there was an ongoing delay, it means that the pioneering warships - who would have the opportunity to demonstrate power overseas - will be out of date by the time they are ready, says Die Zeit.
The frigate was unlucky in the news last year, when the German Navy, officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the builder after accepting it.
Not much was known about the reasons for the ship's return, but German media quoted some "failures on software and hardware" if it was not deployed on a combat mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg type vessels will be operated by a team of 120 sailors - half of the team was on older Bremen type frigates.
Also, it has come to light that the ship is far too heavy, that this reduces the ship's performance and limits the Navy's ability to upgrade in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz", which weighs 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
With the exception of faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the cost of training the staff - is becoming disputed.
The cost is said to have increased to €3.1 billion ($3.6) - up from €2.2 billion at the start.
Problems with the newer frigate are very important due to the recent warnings that the power of the German fleet is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was "running out of ships that can be evacuated."
The official said the issue had increased over the years because old ships were decommissioned but not replaced with new ships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-type frigates were able to form part of the Navy.
The National Trust is rehearsing the secret life of bats.
New research is underway on an estate in the Scottish Highlands and aims to find out how the batsmen use the countryside to hunt for food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammal and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study of scientists at the Scottish National Trust will follow common bats and soprano pipistrelles, as well as Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at special sites around the estate to follow the batsmen's activities during the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team will carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Audio analysis of each record, conducted by experts, will find out the frequency of calls made by bats and what each particular species does.
A habitat map will be made and then a report to show a record of their behaviour in a large picture of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the Scottish National Trust, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and the way in which each of the species uses them.
This information will help demonstrate the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of meadows and how best to conserve woodland for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined dramatically in the last century.
They are threatened by buildings and development work that disrupts their crops and the habitats that are lost.
Wind turbines and lightning can be dangerous where there are fly-paper and some chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
There are no blinds, really.
Their hunting habits at night, however, make their ears more useful than their eyes, when they have to catch prey material.
They detect insects and obstructions in their flight paths from echoes, a sophisticated technique.
The National Trust for Scotland, which is responsible for looking after over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained ten experts, who regularly carry out surveys, inspect fences and, sometimes, rescue.
The organisation has established a separate sanctuary for bats, the first and only in Scotland, at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate's manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the best district for them.
"We have an amazing area for bats here at Threave" he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot about bats that we don't know yet, so the work we do here and at other estates will help us understand what they need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats, prior to the maintenance of buildings and residences, because if destroyed with maternity only, it could kill up to 400 female bats, young bats and possibly all the bats in that area.
Bats are protected and it is against the law to kill, disturb, disturb or destroy their prey.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, asks the public for help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and, for many of the species we have, we don't know how the entire communities of them are doing.
Ronaldo denies the rape that has been attributed to him as lawyers are about to pass the law on to a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned rape as a "fake news," stating that people want to "give themselves publicity" by capitalizing on his name.
His lawyers are about to take a legal case against a German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which publishes the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly gave her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live Instagram video with his followers several hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, attacked the reports and called them "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, it's fake news," said the winner of the Ballon d'Or five times as he spoke into the camera.
‘They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
They want to be famous, when they mention my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player said and smiled at him.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to take a legal case against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, said the player would seek compensation for "damages, at a level consistent with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the worst violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident was alleged to have happened in June 2009 at a robbery at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have gone back to the player's room where he committed a tantalising rape, which is alleged, according to papers filed at the Nevada County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "99 percent" good but that the "one percent" let him down.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that both of them had sex but that it was consensual sex.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at a hospital but that she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of being taken into revenge" and feared "she would be humiliated in front of the public."
The woman, who is 34 years old, says she wants to cancel the arrangement as she is very upset, always, about the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, when the alleged incident occurred, and this summer, he moved to a giant club, Juve, in an arrangement worth €100 million.
Brexit: The UK would be ‘forever sorry' if it lost car makers.
The UK would be 'forever sorry' if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing post-Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Business Secretary.
He said it was a "concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EEC without a deal, it would stop car production at its factory at Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said jobs could be lost, if there were a delay at the border, in the event that there would not be a solution under Brexit.
The Burnaston factory - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year and exported 90% of them to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March, car production at our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other carmakers have said they are concerned about an unresolved EU exit as to how the cross-border trade will work; among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the risks associated with the supply chains in the event of an unresolved Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just in time" basis. Parts come from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes for an order-made car.
If the UK leaves without a deal on 29 March, the border could be disrupted, resulting in delays and a shortage of parts, the industry says.
It would not be possible for Toyota to maintain more than a day's inventory at a Derbyshire factory, the company said, and so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan is "made out accurately to avoid delays like this at the border."
“We need a solution, we want the best solution, not only to allow our current success to continue, but to seize this opportunity,” he told the BBC.
"Our evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with the supply chains, which are very successful at the moment."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be in full stop, but in the long term, it said that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the assemblyman for Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members' concerns were increasing more. "In my experience when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have provided a plan, which is accurate and reliable for the future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and the White House may be delayed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump's important meeting with the deputy Attorney General could be "rescheduled for another week" as the fight under the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel, Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, relations between Trump's aides and the possibility that the president had made a obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump will break the vice-presidency and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence is the backlash that has been heard in Washington over the past months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president being removed from office via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the description.
But he went to the White House last Monday and the news was out that he was about to quit his job.
At the same time, it was announced that Trump would be meeting with the U.N. Security Council in New York.
Trump said he "would have preferred" not to dismiss Rosenstein but the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflicting with the hearing of the Senate committee on the judiciary in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump ordered that the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's plenary hearing.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting she said: "A date has not yet been set for him, it could be taking place this week but I could imagine he would be postponed by another week at the top of all the things that are going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
There are some reporters who wouldn't agree with that statement: Sanders hasn't had an information session for the press since September 10.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked her why the story was so.
Sanders said the briefings were rare because he didn't like TV reporters being "gaming," even though she said: "I wouldn't deny that they're making them."
She then suggested that Trump and the press would have more direct contacts.
"The president has more sessions of questions and answers than any previous president," she said, "but we've looked at those figures without giving any evidence."
Sanders said: "If the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's a thousand times better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do it many times over the last few weeks and this will be put in place for a press briefing when you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences along with eminent visitors.
There are rarely individual press conferences.
The president may have figured out the reason why in New York this week when he met with a plethora of reporters in an unbridled way that was sometimes strange.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about concerns over Brexit
The Health Secretary wrote to EU workers at NHS Scotland to thank them and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish Parliament Member Jeane Freeman has sent a letter with less than six months left until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying for the cost of applications for status as settlers by EU citizens working in public devolved services.
Mr Freeman wrote in his letter: Negotiations were underway between the UK and the EU on Britain's departure, and a decision is expected in the autumn.
The government, however, is continuing to work on its plans without any action being taken.
I know this story is very upsetting to you all.
That's why I want to express my appreciation for the work of all staff regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
There is no doubt that Scotland is your place of residence and we very much want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie suffered an injury to his head
The Tennesseans' Mike Organ reported that the Tennessee State Tigers' line-up's supporter Christion Abercrombie underwent a crisis operation when his head was injured when the Vanderbilt Commodores defeated them 31-27.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred to him a short time before half time.
"He came to the sideline and fell off a cliff," Reed said.
Abercrombie was provided oxygen by trainers and physicians on the line side before being put on a stretcher and brought back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been taken from the observatory at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris also said that "no information is available about the type/size of the injury yet" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a redshirt sophomore and this is his first season playing with Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five total tackles before leaving the game making him a total of 18 tackles during the season.

The stamp duty will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Exchequer estimates that £120 million a year will be raised to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The plan will be seen as an attempt to end the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The stamp duty will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay UK tax and the additional money will be used to expedite the Government's efforts to deal with people living outside.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent - could be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury estimates that it could raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that people who do not live in the UK buy 13 percent of the newly built London properties which raises prices and makes it harder for people to buy their first home.
Many of the country's gastronomic areas - especially in the capital - are cities due to the high number of foreign merchants who spend the majority of their time outside the country.
This new plan came a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty to help more young people to have their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding prices of dwellings high by buying land and not using it and urged Mrs May to abolish quotas on affordable homes to solve Britain's "shame on life" "in terms of housing."
Mr Corbyn announced a series of prominent proposals on housing including rent control and the elimination of the exclusion of no-fault.
He wants to give more powers to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "I said last year that my aim during my time as prime minister would be to reawaken the vision of Britain - that every new generation should have a better life."
And that includes correcting our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and live here.
It shouldn't be as easy for people who don't live in the UK, and for companies based abroad to buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
Many people have a dream of having their own residences and many people find it an insult to go to sleep outside."
Jack Ross: "My last wish is to be manager of Scotland."
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his last wish was to become Scotland's manager at some point.
Jack is a 42-year-old Scottishman who is enjoying his club’s North East revival, finishing third in the First League, three points from the top.
He moved with him to the State of Light in the summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
When I was young, I wanted to fight for my country.
I was given a B cap and that was what it was," Ross said on BBC Scotland's Sportsbound.
"But when I was growing up, my dad and I used to watch Scotland play at Hampden and it's always attracted me back.
I won't have that opportunity unless I'm successful as a manager of a club."
Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio were previous managers of the Sunderland team.
Ross had previously led Alloa Athletic and said that he had no concerns about succeeding in such a prestigious position at a big club and that he had rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"It's my current measure of success to have this club back in the Premier League.
Because of the structure and the abilities of this club there is no doubt that it should be in the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task but I wouldn't say I'm successful if I don't get it back then."
Ross spent just three years as manager and 15 months on the Harts coaching staff as assistant leader with Dumbarton.
He helped Alloa recover from how they were placed in the third tier and made such a transformation of St Mirren who were in danger of being disqualified that they won the Championship the following season.
Ross says that he now feels more comfortable than if he had felt while playing with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably going to be the next election," he said, referring to the general election.
"I really believed that a job as a manager was the right job for me rather than a job as a player.
That may seem strange when I say it but I was pretty good at it, I had a decent entrance and enjoyed some relatively high-pitched highlights.
But the life of the player can sometimes be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to do week after week.
This is what I suffer from in terms of stress and work pressure but I feel like the manager's life is for me.
I always wanted to be a manager and since I have that job now my mind is more relaxed than it has been since I came of age."

5:30 p.m. - Time for a public hearing on the investigation
The summer heat wave is adding to the influx of British pubs that were struggling but putting extra pressure on dining chains.
The figures showed that the arrival of pubs increased by 2.7 per cent but the arrival of dining establishments decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin from business consultancy CGA who compiled the figures said: "The result of England's participation in the World Cup in July which lasted longer than expected was that the July pattern continued when pub revenue was 2.8 per cent higher but the prunings were even more intense.
There was a 1.8 per cent decline in the trade in June and the situation worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that focused on drinking became much better and there were facsimile feeders with a worse facsimile out of it.
The sun's heat caused our pubs to focus on food but it didn't have as dramatic an impact on the foodie population as it did.
People just don't want to go out and eat.
Sales of managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent during the month and food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman from RSM's guest and leisure analysts said: "These results showed the trends we are seeing from the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major sporting and social events are the main factors for sales in the out-of-town market.
It is not surprising that foodie groups continue to struggle, and it will be very difficult for them to accept a 4.8 per cent drop year on year in addition to their ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for those who want to sell food and we will see if the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give them the relief they need.
Pubs and restaurants experienced an overall 2.7 percent growth in July, including newly opened locations, reflecting the ongoing delay in the supply of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitors sales in the pubs, bars and restaurant sector and analyses data from 47 working groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and serves as the industry benchmark.

Twenty percent of the students indicated that they have a "main account" that they show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating a social account that they keep hidden from their parents.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed that fake pages were growing "instantly" - a reference to an instagram photo exchange site.
This has increased the number of people who are concerned about the possibility of getting infected.
Twenty percent of pupils said they have cleared a ‘main account' to show to their parents and also have a private account.
A mother accidentally came upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter where a teenager was yelling at others "I raped" her.
The research conducted by bDigital Awareness UK and the Independent School Principals' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and that those who had private accounts acknowledged who they were.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "The way so many teenagers are attracted to creating online spaces in places where parents and teachers can't find them is worrying."
Eilidh Doyle will act as the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics board at the annual governing board meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most prestigious athlete in field and field and chairman Ian Beattie said the appointment was a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Scottish, UK and world sportspeople have the respect of Eilidh and we are sure that she will go to great lengths to ease Scottish athletics to the table," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very keen to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can do my share to lead the sport in Scotland."

There are conflicting views online about an advertisement that compares milk-producing mothers to cows.
A company that offers breast pumps through an ad has a controversy online in which women who breast your baby are compared to cows who are being breastfed.
On the occasion of the launch of the "world's first portable breast pump" the technology company Elvie launched a half-recent announcement inspired by music to reflect on the freedom the pump gives to mothers who are milking.
There were four mothers dancing in a barn full of grass and playing lyrics like: "Yes, I suck myself but you don't see any tail" and "Just in case you didn't notice these aren't yours but my boobs."
The chorus continues: "Pumping it out, pumping it out, I'm feeding those children." "Pumping it out, pumping it out, I'm pounding my women."
The announcement was posted on the company's Facebook page and sparked controversy online.
He was watched by 77,000 people and referred to by hundreds, with varying opinions, many of whom said that he ignored the "horrible features" of the dairy industries.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product," one person wrote.
"We're like cows in that they need to have a calf to produce milk, but in those cases their babies are stolen a few days after birth."

Another person wrote: "It's obviously a traumatic thing for the mother and the baby.
"But why don't you tell your parents that they can't afford to pay for their children's education?"
Another wrote: "Such a notice. It was cut off from life."
The other woman nodded and said that she thought the man was very attractive.
"I think it's a wonderful plan.
I'd still have some milk.
I was just about to start when the doorbell rang.
The announcement is a little crazy but I took it on its own merits.
"This product is a gift," wrote another.
Another had this reference: This is a comical advertisement aimed at mothers who are pumping (often in their workplaces or toilets) and who feel like "ba".
This is not an advertisement that is praising or criticizing the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the women indicate that they were dancing and the pump discreetly squeezed into their final measures.
The campaign is based on the understanding that a lot of women who are pumping their breasts think they feel like they are.
Elvie Pump is completely silent, does not have wires or tubes, it sits discreetly within a taut tub so that women are able to move around, hold their children in their hands and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, who is a partner and deals with early childhood development at Mother, had this to say: Elvie's Pump is so revolutionary that it earned a bold, exciting launch.
When we showed the relationship between breastfeeding women and dairy cattle we wanted to highlight breastfeeding and all the challenges associated with it, and demonstrate the incredible freedom of the new pump and to do so on an entertaining bee that people could talk about.
This isn't the first time Elvis has been in the news.

The First Migrant Children Quietly Placed to Camp Publ on Texas Border
The number of migrant children arrested has increased significantly, although the number of people crossing the border has changed little, as strict policies and hard talk by Trump have made it more difficult to add children to sponsors.
What happened in the past was that the migrants were sponsored by undocumented migrants but they are now afraid that they will put their ability to stay in the country at risk by applying to sponsor a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that people wishing to become sponsors and adults would have to hand over their fingerprints to their families and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence who is a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Authority revealed to Congress this week that the agency had arrested scores of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later revealed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors, or are members of sponsoring households, in this country are illegally, and criminal aliens make up a large proportion of them.
That's why we're always looking for those people," said Mr Albence.
In seeking to process the children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within one month of their arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to homeless workers.
Many of them will present themselves through video conference rather than in person, to demand an immigration judge to obtain legal status.
Those who are deemed ineligible to receive relief will be quickly expelled from the country.
Homeless workers and reports from the system have shown that in recent months, children in detention are more likely to experience anxiety or depression, resulting in violent incidents or escape attempts.
Supporters said those concerns are compounded in larger facilities such as Tornillo which are so large that a child will not be seen as struggling.
They also said that if children are moved to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally, or to say goodbye to their friends, that could add to the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria orders ‘to arrest' American, French and Turkish forces they immediately cleared out of the country
Speaking at the UN General Assembly Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home despite it being the eighth year that war is taking place in the country.
Moualem who also serves as deputy prime minister, announced that the foreign forces in Syria are illegally apologizing that they are fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must leave immediately without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem declared "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria where 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been driven from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "attempt the holy war until we clear" terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign force from all the territories of Syria."
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria and is providing training and advice mainly to the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in that country who have been destroyed by hostilities.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for their return and blamed "some countries from the west" who are "spreading unreasonable concerns" that are encouraging refugees to stay outside the country.
"We are calling on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are making a political issue for a problem that should be treated as a humanitarian issue only."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said that the recent agreement by Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last stronghold of the rebels, provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey ensured that the three-million-strong province will not be invaded on a large-scale by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem, however, stressed how the agreement has "clear targets of time" and said that he expected jihadists to be targeted during the fighting including fighters of the Nusra Front linked to Al-Quaeda and "to be destroyed."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to hold the first meeting of the new committee soon consisting of representatives of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for Syria for the time when the war is over and in preparation for elections to be held.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said that the committee's work would have to be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and he fulfilled people without putting a word into it.
Trump's second term
According to that understanding Mr. Trump should win the election in 2020 if it does not happen, as many liberals expect, that impeachment or scandal will put an end to the continuation of a premature presidency.
"That would have been the best decision ever made, without a doubt!"
There is currently no sign that the audience is getting tired of it.

There is entertainment in the chaos.
Of course life is not like a television program and the stories from Washington could have an impact on what will happen in the future in the Roe v. Wade case, and whether immigrant families can come together again, and the health of the world's economy.
Only the most gustatory people have the privilege of turning off the television.
However, being an informed citizen is more than just being an informed citizen when watching an expert panel as they discuss how Bob Woodward used a "deep background" as the source for his book "Fear," or a pilot's heel with his ostracized feathers that Paul Maanafort had bought for $15,000 (the Washington Post said of her that she was "delighted with subjects") or the gratifications of the Stormy members who are describing the "evils."

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week the sun was shining and a temperature of 80 degrees was out there outside his residence on the upper shores of Kauai but there was an inner tension watching MSNBC and CNN's record.
He was unable to separate himself from the television show since Brett Kavanaugh was to be arraigned before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's fate between the two ends of the measles.

The money will go towards the next mid-term elections for the House of Representatives.
It's no surprise that a flood of money has been pouring into Pennsylvania's 17th district since a new layout was put on the conference grounds so that two elected members compete for the same seat.
A new boundary was designed for the suburban Pittsburg district in such a way that Democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring
against current Republican MEP Keith Rothfus who is the current representative of Pennsylvania's old district 12 which significantly overlaps new district 17.
The maps were retracted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the former districts were unconstitutionally laid out in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district began with a round of heavy blows between the main funders of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name is popular in Pennsylvania after he won a special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March that was watched by many.
The Republican held the seat for over a decade and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats are a little bit ahead.
Sam was thinking of punishing the Elves for supporting China but withdrew.
Diplomats noted that Beijing was recognized by the Dominican Republic and Panama and that Washington had little to do with it.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in July 2017 and they had a hotel in Panama until their partners ordered the Trump Organization management to leave it.
Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman said in a statement to value this month that State Department officials decided to call back the leaders of America's diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions made without further recognition of Taiwan."
But punishing none of them was thought of except for El Salvador which received $140 million in aid in 2017 from America, including drug control aid as well as development and economy support.
Among the penalties being proposed included cuts to financial aid, targeted restrictions on visas that would severely disrupt this country in Central America with high rates of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings progressed officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was to continue from a similar meeting held last year and was seen as a breakthrough in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
But senior officials of the administration indicated before mid-September that they wished for the conference to go ahead thus ending any plan to penalize El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is to speak at the conference to be held in mid-November and diplomats say that this shows that the administration considers the meeting very important.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no tough messages about punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to speak about the details of the controversy but three American officials including two diplomats described them on condition their names not be mentioned.
The accounts they gave were supported by an external analyst who spoke on condition that his/her name was not mentioned.
History Studies
The next hit may be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on how Mr. Trump may have obstructed justice and there's a lot of evidence in the public record about that.
There are reports around that Mr Mueller is also targeting to see if Mr. Trump has worked in collusion with Russia in the attack they made on our elections.
If another party gets the lead in the U.S. Congress, Mr. Trump may have to account for what he did before that situation just when he is going before the voters and possibly before the jury of his peers.
The situation is quite uncertain and I do not want to suggest that it is inevitable that Mr. Trump will be attacked or anyone like him in Europe.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on how long the confrontation will continue.

The course of history turns around such points and movement will be slowed or accelerated for the halting of democracy.
The U.S. is dealing with a lot of these issues.
What do we do if Mr. Trump gives a stick and a road to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's in store for Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since this newspaper reported last year that he was recording the president in a coma and expressed views that he was not fit for office.
Mr Rosenstein says The Times account is inaccurate.
"What will we say if it is found that the F.B.I.'s recently called for Brett Kavanaugh's inquiry will be complete or fair - or if he is reconfirmed as a Supreme Court judge despite plausible allegations that he sexually assaulted and gave dishonest evidence.
And above all else will we vote in the midterm elections for the U.S. Congress that will ensure that Mr. Trump has to account for what he did?
If we fail these tests, there will be a long and difficult winter for democracy.

Graham Dorrans in the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will be hosts when they play against Rapid Vienna on Thursday. Rangers did very well when they finished on a combined scoreline against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month and if they win at Rapid Vienna they will have a good chance of qualifying for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury put him out for Graham Dorrans and he was unable to play his first game this season until the match against Villarreal which ended on a 2-2 scoreline.
"We're going to be a great team," said 31-year-old Graham.
"We went to the game hoping to get an advantage from him and we got a point.
We might be able to get the win at the end but, overall, finishing on a joint score was a good result.
They were probably better in the first half but we improved in the second half and we were better than them.
It's going to be a big European night.
I hope we get three points but it will be a hard game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the support of the crowd, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.
We certainly had a hard year last year, with the injuries that happened to me and the changes that happened in the club itself but we think that everything is fine now.
The fit is good and the fit is good, and the fit is excellent.
I hope that we can continue to work together and make this a reality."
Women falling asleep at night due to anxiety about retirement savings
Despite the fact that the people who took part in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, not many of them were talking to their family members about it.
About half of those who took part in a Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want family members to care for them but they're not doing anything to talk to them about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is the place to start it.
Talk to your spouse and children. You cannot prepare your children to provide care unless you tell them well in advance what you want.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you would like to be cared for as this could have a significant impact on the cost.
Tell your financial adviser to advise: The adviser may suggest ways for you to pay for these costs.
Options for long-term care may include traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid money value policy to help you meet these costs, or provide self-insurance for your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Confirm your legal documents: Avoid legal cases before they start.
Appoint a healthcare professional to act on your behalf so that you can appoint someone you trust to look after your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your needs in case you are unable to communicate.
Think about giving a person power of attorney over your money matters.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are left disabled.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical crisis and is on their way to hospital.

A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was often shot with an air rifle while walking home after spending the night on the cans.
The victim is in his forties and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Officials described the shooting as having occurred thirsty by 02:30 GMT and said it was a "random act".
He didn't see the man who shot him.
He didn't want the police to arrest him, and he wanted the police to arrest him.
Landslides and earthquakes in Indonesia
Officials estimate that at least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday and it is estimated that the number of dead will increase.
The communication systems have been destroyed and relief officers are unable to obtain any information from the viceroyalty of Donggala, located north of Palu and closer to the epicentre of the earthquake which had a strength of 7.5.
Over 16,000 people of the Palu people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, it is located at the end of a narrow bay on the east coast of the island of Sulawesi and was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was struck by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a relic that extends beyond 300 km (180 mi) along the coast to the northwest of the Sulawesi islands.
Regency is an administrative region of less than five provinces with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi province is largely dependent on fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but most of it is done in Morowali on the opposite coast beyond Sulawesi.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Palu and Donggala have been frequent over the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area of the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered by a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, half of whom died in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering tsunamis on the southern coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered tsunamis up to 10 metres high that destroyed scores of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's viceroyalty in Aceh. It damaged and panicked those remembered at the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
At that time, there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed when buildings fell to the ground.
2018: Earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, most of whom were on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded temporarily.
Sarah Palin's Son Is Arrested For Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, who is 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of being guilty of domestic violence, disrupting the sending of a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes he took her phone from her.
According to a report from KTUU Palin has been deferred to Mat-Su's Pre-Trial Facility while being kept on a $500 unsecured bond.
According to the network when he appeared before court on Saturday and when asked what he was pleading for he replied "not guilty, certainly affirmative".
Palin is being accused of three Class A misdemeanours which mean he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
A class B misdemeanour has also been charged which means he could be sentenced to a day in prison along with a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
He was accused in December 2017 of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Veterans Affairs.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, disturbing crime reporting about domestic violence, possession of a weapon while under the influence of substance in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he gave her a fist in the face.
Sarah Palin's former soldiers' groups were criticised in 2016 for suggesting that her son's violent behaviour resulted from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have died as a result of an earthquake that struck the Sulawesi island of Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5 and triggered tsunamis that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are deteriorating and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck a short distance from central Sulawesi which is on the northeast side of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos being launched on social media showing the moment the ground began to shake.
The first people to arrive at the scene of the crime were in a state of shock when the police opened fire on them.
Death penalty claimed by Federal prosecutors.
Federal prosecutors are calling for Sayfullo Saipov to be sentenced to death, who is suspected of having carried out the terrorist attack in which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that no one in the state has been charged with since 1953.
It is alleged that 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot rental truck to attack a bike range along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and had previously abducted pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed the eight victims and caused serious bodily harm, according to the announcement of the intention to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges are accompanied by a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov in 22 charges that included eight charges of murder for the benefit of camouflage, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "a large amount of planning and planning" and that Saipov committed it in a "grieving, cruel and brutal manner."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was responsible for injury, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadent, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," detailed in the confidential notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time that the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death sentence.
The defendant was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is originally from Uzbekistan, expressed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was encouraged to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested that the flag of ISIS be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
"We have taken the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea for life imprisonment without any possibility of admitting that the trauma of those events will be prolonged for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death sentence
The Prime Minister has said that the Nigerian government should be in charge of the negotiations on the future of the country.
Nigel Farage promised to ‘send the people's army' today as he protested at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must be under pressure from Eurosceptics - with one of Theresa May's own MEPs suggesting that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that the UK would now be "dismissed" if Mr Farage became Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces as she seeks to bring together her party's loyal supporters and Tory supporters has been highlighted as part of a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It is difficult for the prime minister to keep his Chequers conciliation plan on track when attacking Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the EU.
Her supporters confirmed that she will continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the counter-response - and will force Eurosceptics to choose between her own package and a ‘trump pole'.
Mr. Bone said at the rally Eventing in Solihull meant that he wanted ‘Chequers thrown out'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he was in charge, we would be gone now,’ he said.
MEP Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand up for Brexit but we need to throw out Chequers.’
Explaining the reasons why it is against the EU, he said: ‘We have not fought world wars to be obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds is that they want to stay completely false out.'
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also present at the march, told reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public is not happy with Chequers, the opposition is not going to vote for him, our party supporters and our activists who walk the streets and get us votes in the first place are not happy with him.
I want you to get out there and listen."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she also said: ‘Prime ministers keep their jobs when they add to their word.'
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians would need to be ‘pressured' if they were to abandon the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
‘It is now a matter of interim confidence -- the people -- and our political class,' he said.
‘They are trying to abandon Brexit and we are here today to tell them ‘we will not let you do that’.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: ‘I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is about to abandon Brexit.
‘We are going to send the army of the people in this country who gave us victory in Brexit and we will not allow ourselves to rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.’
Meanwhile, Remain supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
There have been a number of protests against the move since the group was formed at the end of last year.
The peer from Labour Lord Adonis joked about the Conservatives for the security difficulties they had with party application while starting the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can implement the IT systems as well as all the technology for Canada and more, for a border without confrontation, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he also said.
‘A kind of rhymes.
"There is no such thing as a good time or a bad time," he said.
Warren intends to ‘look intently' at standing in the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "look closely at standing in the presidential election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticises President Donald Trump, is standing for election again in November against Republican state Representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It's possible that he'll run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors and the format of the town hall meeting being used since Trump began his term of office.
One of the attendees asked her if she intended to stand for election to the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes a woman at the top."
Man arrested after Sims was released from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect in the death of the basketball player from LSU Wayde Sims had been arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at a conference at 11a.m. E.T.
They released a video of the release on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died because of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde wanted to protect his friend and was released by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, had a weapon, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without difficulty and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6-inch junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and his average per game was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heading towards the world championship after the team orders him to be awarded the win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and barely left Hamilton on the empty beach after he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team mate.
Vettel first entered the shafts and left Hamilton six to meet the traffic at the back of the pack, something that should have had a major impact on matters.
The Mercedes went to the pit stop one circuit later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel activity after the Ferrari driver had left the interior reluctantly with the risk that he would stand firm after a double move to protect the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then dominated for a large part of the race while keeping hold of his tyres to concentrate on a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the shafts on the 44th circuit but was unable to increase his speed in the other eight circuits while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a hard day because Valtteri tried very hard the whole weekend and it was a gentleman in that he let me over.
The team has done an excellent job and one-on-one with them," said Hamilton.
There was a terrible accident that happened at the time
President Donald Trump joked about Senator Dianne Feinstein mobilizing on Saturday after she insisted she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly discuss Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "misogynistic and ugly and untrue."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on for the last few days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and unkind and ugly and false," he said.
"When you look at stories of releases and leaks and say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't make it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, what do you think?
"Do you remember when you said, 'Oh, what?
Oh, not a leak.
I didn't whistle."
Well, wait a minute.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
A letter addressed to Feinstein detailing the allegations at Kavanaugh's Ford was sent back in July, and was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her own office.
"I didn't conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't divulge his story," Feinstein told the committee, reported in The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it as she asked."
But the president did not seem to accept his denial, saying during a mobilization on Saturday night: "I'll tell you the truth, that was terrible body signaling.
Maybe it's just the best collaboration I've ever seen."
"Continuing to defend the nominee to the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested the Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations on their own behalf.
"They're set on taking back the power, no matter the way they do it.
You see the suspense, the granularity, it doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to put under their feet to gain power and control," the president said according to a Mediaite report.
From the top of the league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
A bye in the loss in the Top League on Friday against Belfast Giants by securing the victory in the 5-3 return game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were led by two backs early in the game after Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home side to a combined score before Dwyer put the Giants ahead again.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before the win after two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
It was the third defeat of the season in the top-flight for the Adam Keefe team, who came from behind to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the sides, with the Giants receiving the win in the previous three games.
Dwyer's first back came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford helping Beauvillier get the second back for the team four minutes later.
During a very busy starting period, Sullivan took the home side back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the joint score to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were ahead before the first break before scoring his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side reorganised themselves and once again Bouchard scored for them with a massive attack back at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time in the game last time in the second period and made sure they would win with the fifth halfback of his team through the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four out of the last five games, will play against Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Make Sure Firsts Person on Aircraft Can Escape from Land Crash
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is said to be a hero after he died while making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people got up safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday triggering a tsunami.
The area is still being hit by strong aftershocks and many people are stranded in the debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his comrades fled with their soul, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the wildly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He then waited to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would safely erect eaves.
Then he jumped from a control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesperson Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported in ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we missed it in the morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear about this," he said.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that there may be thousands dead and the country's disaster mitigation agency saying there is a border on entrance to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of dead is still estimated to be increasing as many bodies were still under the debris as many couldn't be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Palu is destroyed by waves that reached up to six meters and mass burial will then take place on Sunday.
Weapons and business aircraft are building into aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother to Sky News, said: "Every minute an ambulance takes in bodies.
There is no clean water.
The markets are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross Society in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross Society in Indonesia is running to help the survivors but they don't know what they will find there.
It's a problem, but it could be much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the work related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia says one man is missing, having earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew members safely departed from the plane immersed.
Air Niugini said in an issue that from the afternoon on Saturday there was no passenger finding men.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in trying to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials on Friday said that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the crash and what exactly happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane went over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's great," said Jayne.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through water sparingly to the escape routes on the immersed plane.
He said that the plane attendants were panicked and were shouting and suffered a minor injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on how to improve the rescue helped by using an inflatable boat to bring people to beach before the plane tumbled in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in crashes at PNG-registered airlines in the last twenty years but none of them involved Air Niugini.
An analyst sets out the timeline of the night that a woman was burned alive.
His case was brought by the prosecutors on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The S.A.M. Justice Department's Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for the long hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to compile a story about the movements of 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received replacement data from many mobile phones that showed Tellis had accompanied Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted what he had previously claimed, reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When the details showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up on the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not at home that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth while saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "telling a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another difference is that Tellis said that he knew Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
The couple said they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact details from his phone sometime after Chambers' death.
"It's ruined her life," Hale said.
It is understood that the defenders will give his closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Childminders in NY pass the law on a couple after she is given a stick and a road due to a "racial" text message
A New York childminder is to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a misleading text message from her mother in which she complained that she was "another blue person."
The couple denies being racist, and compares the legal case to extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was blue when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"Oh MY GOD, ANOTHER BLUE PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending her to her husband, however, she sent her to Ms. Maurice twice.
After she realized she had made a mistake, Plasco-Flaxman while uncomfortable, slapped and slapped Ms. Maurice, saying that her outgoing babysitter had done a bad job and was African-American and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was given a payment for the work day she had done and then sent home for Uber.
Now Maurice is getting the couple legal for dismissing her from her job, and she's seeking compensation equal to $350 a day for the resident position, six months she was employed for, although she wasn't given a contract.
"I'm trying to show them, look, you shouldn't do things like that," she told the Post on Friday, also saying "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have reacted on the assertion that they are racist, saying that ending Maurice's employment was a reasonable thing, and fearing that they could not be trusted after she interfered with them.
"My wife told me something she didn't want to hear.
It's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Do you think you'll be able to keep up with your friends even if you've lost them?"
Your newborn baby?
Listen now!"
Plasco compared the case to "racism" and said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and she was "in trouble."
"You're going to kill someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public did not hesitate to criticize the couple on social media, while pasting them because of their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers with a talking bear would not understand
Karen Jankel's daughter, who was born soon after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine you were someone who was first reading it before it was published."
"It's great to know that we're getting closer to Paddington."
Stating that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being encouraged by a small teddy bear to write a children's book, would be positive even though his work was rejected, she also said that the 60th anniversary celebrations of the book's publication after his death last year were "delighted and saddened."
As for Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important family member," she said her father was proud of her success in the end not to be boastful about it.
"He was a man and he was fighting for himself," she said.
"But since Paddington seemed like a real person to him, it was almost like having a kid who does well: you're proud of an essay even though it wasn't you who made the most of it.
I think that's how he looked at Paddington's success.
Although he was the one who created it and dreamed of it, he always gave himself the recognition of Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I was safe to say it on the phone.
After landing her daughter was quickly taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors worked free of charge to save her life.
"Nad was regularly calling me to say that it was very bad, that she was not expected to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I said to save her.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, my heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs given to her by the doctors to keep her heart pumping were soon disappearing and disappearing from her system.
She died some time before and now everything was shut down.
I was just sitting there, knowing that this was going to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry, because I was crying, and I was in pain.
I kept to myself."
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, distressed by the death of her daughter, eventually boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - unaware of her heartache.
"We didn't know," she said.
My head was pounding and my heart was pounding all the time.
It's hard to explain but when I was on the flight I felt profound pity for Nad.
My love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's self-defence cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are trying to keep others from dying by themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages as well as numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he developed depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want to have to deal with the pain every day," she said.
Ms Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef and her meanderings would get others excited.
Everyone knew him because of his temper.
They're going to end up burning down a room."
However, he resigned from his post before his death because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's then 11-year-old brother, who became his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always concerned that it's going to have an impact on that."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know there are people they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't hold your breath if you need to talk.
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms Davies for many years, lost her 15-year-old spouse, Mark, soon after his mother's death.
He didn't say he was depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in mindset.
It was at the real Christmas Eve - when the children opened their gifts he didn't look at them or anything."
She said it was a great grief for him to die, but they confronted him: "He has torn apart the children.
It separates us from each other.
But we all have to continue to fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in danger and the FBI has begun an investigation
"I thought, if we really were able to get something like what he wanted - a limited investigation in terms of time, scope - that we might have unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, while also saying that he feared the committee was "falling apart" with tight partisan ties.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It is because of time constraints that drugs are contraindicated.
There are only 5 weeks left until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if the Republicans do poorly, as expected, they will be much weaker as they try to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is on the phone calling Senators and asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and then got to know his wife Ashley, while she was his personal secretary for Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI has made its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break ties and declare him to the Supreme Court.
There has been a decrease in the number of people who have given up smoking in South Korea.
The number of people who have given up North Korea to leave for South Korea has gone down since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unified ministry, said 1,127 people gave up on North Korea last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China were key factors in higher rates being imposed by smugglers.
Pyongyang did not speak in public.
South Korean citizenship is eventually produced for most people who give up on North Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the furthest border to North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Unarmed Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers those who abandon North Korea to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their own country by pressure.
The relationship between North and South Korea - which is still technically at war with each other - has improved significantly over the past several months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries held a meeting in Pyongyang for talks aimed at the negotiations on nuclear disarmament that were not going ahead.
This happened following a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Singapore's Kim Jong-un, when they agreed on a general way of working towards the Korean Peninsula as a nuclear weapons-free place.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho laid the blame for US sanctions for the lack of progress from that.
"If the US is not trusted, there will be no confidence in our national security and in those circumstances, there is no way that we will disarm ourselves on our own accord first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "conservative", and not fit to be served in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was "humble" and mentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I have to think that if a woman had done that, they would have said 'shame'," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the two of them were teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very unnerving, almost shouting and sometimes leaving speechless as he talked about his family and his time in high school.
He clearly criticized the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "ugly and coordinated defamation" organized by angry liberals that Hilary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony, which he could not serve in the Supreme Court, was proof that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way in which he went about pursuing the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
When asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if declared, and if Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives, she disagreed with that.
"If he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not just fit to be in the Supreme Court but to be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi also said she was concerned as a Democrat about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for someone who's a toddler, inclined to go to court and expect us to say ‘that's not great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to change it.
It is a corrective force, releasing the months and years of anger, and she cannot let it go out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued, "A woman who was an executive somewhere helped me a lot, telling me she used to cry too when she became angry, but who developed a technique of meanness when she became angry and started crying, would say to the person she used to be talking to, 'Maybe you'd think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I feel bad."
And then she followed her.
And I thought that was wonderful."
Allowing tears is a way of releasing anger as they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest memories from an early job, in an office where men had dominance, where I once found myself crying with anger that I couldn't express, was that an older woman grabbed the back of my neck - a hostile manager I'd always feared - and pulled me into a log of stairs.
"Don't ever let them see that you're crying," she told me.
"You don't know you're mad.
They will be glad to see you, and they will be glad to see you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart while running for the presidency.
In 1987, when it was revealed that Mr. Hart was in a relationship outside of marriage on a boat called Monkey Business and when he left the race, Ms. Schroeder, with great frustration, decided that she should consider running for the presidency herself.
"It wasn't a wise decision," she told me, laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race and the last one was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As a result of his last in the campaign, she was behind in fundraising and so promised that she would only enter the race if she had raised $2 million.
It was a work in progress.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give $250 a dice.
"Do you think I'm lazy?" she asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so excited - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system because it was so difficult to raise money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger with sexism - that she became stagnant.
"I thought I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled of the media response to her.
"I'm assuming that Kleenex was a corporate sponsor for me.
I remember thinking, what are you going to put on my gravestone?
"She did it?"
The reason why the trade war between the US and China might make Beijing good
You would be moved to the open arms of the US-China trade war, and while the war is not over at all, Beijing could benefit in the long term from a dispute between the countries, experts say.
US President Donald Trump made the first warning earlier this year when he imposed a tax on China's core exports, including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
The most significant tightening occurred this week with new tariffs affecting goods valued at $200 billion (£150 billion), which meant that almost half of all goods coming into the US from China have been taxed.
Beijing takes revenge in the same way every time, with the most recent action being imposing tariffs of five to ten per cent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the US blow, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will be disrupted any time now.
If Washington were to stand back it would mean it would be necessary to concede to their demands, but it would be too much of a shame if Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, were to be publicly gaoled to the US.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards properly, the pressure from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger a failure of the economy in either country is actually much more dangerous than previous observers have admitted," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on the Facility at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country after it was destroyed by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government is still restoring areas destroyed by terrorists to make things go back to how they normally are.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that focused on their daily lives and livelihoods are now in full swing.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
More than six million people still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he made it clear that he would not accept aid or conditions from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after winning it against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
He has now lost six consecutive times to the USA on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to get the best of the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, threw his dive into the water at the 16th par hole to 3, and surrendered the game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer made the move in every round, and was one of four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated at 5&4 by the player in the lowest position of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The highest ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson 2 and 1 fell to Ian Poulter from England who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, an eight-time Ryder Cup grandmaster, was the most successful European to ever play in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I'm not crying, but I'm not crying right now.
It was a difficult year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting him with us.
I'm so happy to be back, I'm glad to be back.
The team is the most important thing and I'm glad I was able to help them," Garcia said excitedly after Europe's victory.
He will now be replaced by John Ram from the same country, who won 2&1 on the famous U.S. golfer Tiger Woods in singles on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have won against Tiger Woods, we were looking at that guy as I grew up," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods missed the four games he played in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's a curious statistic for one of the best players ever, having won 14 major championships, and just Jack Nicklaus before him.
It was difficult for the U.S. team to find the blanks throughout the entire weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played excellent golf throughout the competition.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's play was a disappointment author said, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
The next morning, we decided to go to Europe.
We fought.
It's a tribute to Thomas.
A very good Captain.
Its 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize ourselves, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I'm proud of these 12 men and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to rejoice.
The other team played better than us."
