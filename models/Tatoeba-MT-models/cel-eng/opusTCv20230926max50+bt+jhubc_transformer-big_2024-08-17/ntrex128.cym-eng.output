Welsh AMs worried they will ‘look silly'
Some AMs are concerned about a suggestion to change their titles in English to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Senedd Cymru in Welsh).
This will change the name of the meeting to the name of the meeting.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be the subject of ridicule.
Labour's AM said her group was worried because the title "adds to the words Twp and Pwp."
And for anyone who understands Welsh: You don't want to be called that name.
He said the group was generally "unhappy" with the suggestion and had offered other options.
A Communist Party spokesman said that his group kept an "open mind" regarding the name change, but suggested that there is not much verbal difference between MWP and "Muppet".
The ASC English translation doesn't cause as much trouble.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change in name, said: "Of course, it will be for the members themselves to make the final decision on any descriptions of Assembly Members' titles."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals. There was widespread support for the assembly’s call in the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of Assembly Members, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament (WMP), but MWP came out strongly in the public consultation.
AMs are reportedly suggesting other options, but the work of coming to a consensus could cause a headache for the Llywydd, Elin Jones. She is expected to bring forward draft legislation on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The legislation on the amendments will include other changes to the way the planning works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
They will have the final vote on what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "The Republic of North Macedonia."
This popular vote was drawn in an attempt to resolve a dispute that has lasted decades with Greece, a neighboring country that has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbourhood represents a right on its territory. She has repeatedly opposed the country’s requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Gjorge Ivanov, the President of Macedonia, opposes the country's vote on a name change and has said that he will dismiss the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that a name change is the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St Martin's bells in Tewi as Churches in Harlem Face Difficulties
"Historically, there was a bar and a church on every corner, according to the old people I have spoken to," Mr. Adams said.
Today is one of them."
He wondered why the trees had disappeared.
"People socialize in a different way today", he said.
"Now bars are not considered community living rooms where people go on a regular basis."
Concerning churches, he is concerned that the money raised by selling assets will not last as long as the leaders expect it to, "and as long as they are late, they will be back in the same old position."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condominiums full of the kind of people who won't help the rest of the area's condos.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominia in these buildings will be white," he said, "which will mean that all these churches will close sooner because it is unlikely that most of these people who move to these condominia will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved from there in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's church was transferred to a black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the retailers on 125 Street, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, which refused to hire or hire black people.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but as the parishioners of Father Johnson made plans for rebuilding, the bells were commissioned.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and a rector at St Martin's church, was proud to have the name "the poor's bells" on them.
The expert singing the bells in July gave them another name: "cultural treasure" and "unique historical instrument."
Also, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noticed that these were the first bells in the world to be sung by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to sing the larger bells at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's church had no one in place.
What has happened at St Martin's church in recent months has been a complex history of architects and contractors, some of whom have been employed by the lay leaders of the church, and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the governing body of the parish consisting of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July to raise concerns that the diocese would "try to hand over the costs" to the vestry, although the vestry had not been involved in employing the architects and contractors that the diocese had sent there.
Some critics have argued that there was a lack of transparency on the part of the government.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy as he dives in search of lobsters in California
Officials said a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him on Saturday while he was diving in search of lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7am near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy shouting for help. He then swam to him with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he thought the boy was initially excited about catching a lobster. But, upon reaching the boy, Hammel told him "remember that he was shouting, ‘I have been bitten!
I've been duped!"
His shoulder bridge was torn open".
I urged everyone to get out of the water: ‘There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was lifted from the water in a helicopter and taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in a critical condition.
We do not know which species of shark was responsible for the attack.
In a media briefing, lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles said the victim sustained injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami beach in Ecinitas. This was done for 48 hours for safety and investigation purposes.
Giles said there were more than 135 shark species in the area but that most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to reach the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty aisles in the form of department stores made up of specialist assistants.
As part of the drive to reach the UK beauty market, a £2.8bn market that is still growing despite declining sales of fashion and homeware, these larger beauty aisles will be trialled at 11 stores across the country. They will be placed in more stores next year if they are successful.
This investment into the world of beauty comes as supermarkets look for ways to use empty shelves after being prosecuted for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of its beauty products offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Goods from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space and the branded areas will be similar to those you'll see in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up collection so that most products are vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly in demand among young shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will be trialling concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores. The first opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The fact that people shop online and move towards buying a little food every day at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with the discounters Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since it bought the two chains two years ago. It says that that has strengthened food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous effort to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership came to an end following a dispute over how to share the revenue of the pharmacy shops in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain. The business included 281 stores and was sold for £125m.
He said Lloyds would be part of the scheme as it would add an extended range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We've completely changed the look and feel of our beauty hunts to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be there to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a vital beauty destination challenging the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand of accessories and goods to the home.
The pair's business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
Willoughby, one of the presenters of This Morning, posted a message on Instagram announcing her departure.
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own major new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "frightened" on Tuesday when the presenter admitted at a meeting at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time for Truly, their accessories and homeware brand.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and there was mention that it doubled Willoughby's fortune, being an estimated £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones travelled from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Really was one of Holly's top priorities.
That was her future in the long term and the work she would have done over the next few decades.
Everyone was surprised when she decided to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, as it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, ready to be sold."
Experts believe this decision by one of Britain’s most bankable stars could cost the company millions due to a major investment in products, including cushions, candles, clothes and household goods. This could also mean further delays ahead of launch.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, aged 52, as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, a source who is friends with Jones said, "We wouldn't comment on his business issues."
It was a difficult course ‘and then we fell in love'
He made fun of the criticism that would be found by the news media for making "unprecedented" comment, according to some, and for being so positive when talking about the leader from North Korea.
"Why did the Trump administration give up so much?"
Trump said by mocking a news presenter.
"I didn't throw anything."
He said Kim was eager to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting which Trump described as a major step forward in denuclearizing North Korea.
But the discussions on denuclearisation have slowed down.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not believe the US is responding in line with North Korea's early denuclearization movements.
Instead, he said the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump was much more confident in his big speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had led to positive results - stopping testing rockets, helping to free hostages and ensuring the remaining American troops returned home.
He went on to justify his unusual approach when it came to talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia's Tsunami and Earthquake Destroyed Island, by Killing Hundreds
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, something that is necessary to catalyze international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not seek international assistance, so it is quite challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is creating a team to travel to Palu, they are not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the land.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be given assistance.
Because the earth is constantly vibrating in Indonesia, the country is never ready enough for nature disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
There appears to have been no siren warning of the tsunami in Palu, although a warning was given, which contributed to the number of deaths.
It is difficult to travel between the many islands of Indonesia at best.
Natural disasters mean that the logistics are even more complex.
A hospital ship moored in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's racing infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But there has been a lack of funding for Mr Joko's administration as he faces a re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from long-lasting denominational tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs stormed the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other non-violent weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of the Liverpool team, scoring a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge stopped Liverpool from losing a Premier League match to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Xherdan Shaqiri's Sturridge got a pass and he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He kicked the ball to his left before shooting towards the far post.
The ball rose high above the box as it moved towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally the ball came down for Kepa Arrizabalaga as he jumped and dropped the ball to the net.
"I was trying to get to that position and get a hold of the ball and players like Shaq are always playing whenever possible, so I was trying to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and I kicked the ball without thinking too much about it, just go for it."
Half-time, Chelsea were winning 1-0 after Eden Hazard, the Belgian star, scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea striker passed the ball with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic on that occasion, before turning away near the centre of the field and sprinting into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic gave a quick ‘kick and go' bass in the middle of the field.
He then kicked the ball forward skillfully between the other team's defenders, leading Hazard into the box.
Hazard was ahead of the defender and finished in the far post with a kick with his left foot past one of Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in a Premier League group stage match at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The total number of deaths following Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's agency for disasters said early on Sunday morning.
It was recorded that many people were stuck in the rubble of buildings that fell when the magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck on Friday, an earthquake that caused waves as high as 20 feet, a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which includes more than 380,000 people, was covered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Penbedw, Deeside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed in Grayson Mews at 7.55am on John Street and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging people in the area to let them know if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘Although the investigation is only just beginning, I would ask anyone who was in the John Street area of Penbedw to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
Also, if anyone, particularly taxi drivers, caught anything on dashboard cameras, they should contact us in case they have information that is vital to our investigation".
A police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from the area of Penbedw and that her body had been found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the site to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back into his flat but police have told him no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He had no words when he heard it.
The residents are now being informed that they will have to wait a few hours before being allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
The woman entered the room with tears in her eyes.
She still repeats ‘this is so terrible'.
At 2pm there were two police vans in the cordon and another van was outside.
A number of officers standing in the cordon monitored the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolcC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 noting entry 247 30 September.
Cromwell's statue outside the Senedd is the latest memorial to be part of the ‘re-wamping of history' row
The removal of the statue would be a poetic justice for the terrible destruction that caused so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts, a destruction carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society said Mr Crick's suggestion was one of "truths" that "try to revamp history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that, in the current debate over the removal of statues, Oliver Cromell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
Cromwell was not responsible for the execution or command of the iconoclasty of England's civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent portrait of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and is part of the historiography of a figure that many people believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell as a figure who protected parliament from external pressure, which in his case was the monarchy.
We don't know if that's true or not, but it's an ongoing debate.
What is certain is that the collision in the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our country after that and Cromwell is a single well-known figure representing one side of the argument.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Rheibus Pig Kills a Farmer from China
A mosque attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
South China Morning Post said on Sunday that a man, who was known by his surname ‘Yuan', had been found dead near a pig's tusk at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province. His arteries had broken and he was bloodied over it.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Tunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The following morning his cousin found him dead and noticed that a nearby pig's tuck door was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the tuck and there was blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had torn the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs had been torn off and they were all bloodied," said the cousin, who was called by his surname, "Wu", according to a quote in the Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera video showed Yuan reaching the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
It wasn't the animal that killed the man or the animal that killed him.
One of the market managers told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the site.
The family of Yuan and the market authorities are reportedly discussing compensation for his death.
Although there are not many of them, there are other records of cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years later, a 650-pound pig held a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife frightened the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, one of Manitoba's farmers told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can cause them to behave that way.
"They're cautious.
They're young, very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
"You have to give them a lot of credit," he said.
Hurricane Rosa causes heavy rain over a large area of the southwestern United States
According to forecasters, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's west coast.
However, hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern US over the next few days.
Rosa had 85 mph winds, a Category 1 hurricane, from 5am ahead of Eastern time on Sunday. The hurricane was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, the hurricane will begin pushing deep tropical humidity north to southwest USA.
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will then react with the approaching trough causing heavy rainfall over the south-west over the next few days.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of rain will cause major dangerous flooding, a stream of rubble and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates between 2 and 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 2 and 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southeast, especially over much of Arizona.
Major flooding with the conditions may be rapidly worsening due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very unwise to venture out into the wilderness on foot with a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could cause the gorges to become wild rivers and a storm of lightning and thunder will cause strong winds and gusts of dust in the area.
The approaching trough will cause some localized heavy rainfall in parts of the Southern California coast.
A total of more than half an inch of rain may fall, which may cause a slight flow of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the area's first rainfall during its wet season.
A few scattered tropical showers will begin to reach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before the rains spread more late Monday night and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will last throughout Wednesday.
The temperature will change dramatically throughout the US during October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in the temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic changes in temperature throughout the mid-U.S. Sunday.
There is nearly 20 degrees of difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, what remains of the summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Much of the mid and east of the USA is expected to get a warm start to October with temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Levels to parts of the North East.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high chance for above average temperatures for the eastern US throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million watch Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s, give evidence on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political disagreement was continuing, with broadcasters disrupting routine programs to broadcast the unexpected turn of events Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake indicated that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had inappropriately touched her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party, when he was drunk.
Kavanaugh said in giving his testimony that he was absolutely sure that that did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people are likely to have watched it on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company counted the average number of audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.
To give perspective, the size of this audience was similar to that of an audience who would watch a football game or an Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, the channel's opinion hosts have given strong support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, who headed all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, NSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was a lot of interest from the audience as well.
Flake was the dominant figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office declared it would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning with protesters shouting at him as he tried to get into a lift to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He looked at the floor for a few minutes as he got a head full, live on television on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He said, "You have the power and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said that before the lift closed, he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all filmed live hours later, when it came time for the Judiciary Committee to vote to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination and have a vote in full Parliament.
But Flake said he would only do so as long as the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominee by the following week, an outcome that minority Democrats have been urging.
Flake was partially convinced after chatting with his friend, the Democratic Senator, Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and many other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was a powerful one, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British MP May accuses critics of ‘playing politics' in Brexit case
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticise her plans to leave the European Union saying they "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine the national interest.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, criticised what she calls the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying it was "absolutely ridiculous" a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs.
Wayde Sims shooting case: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of killing one of LSU's players
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and will go to prison on suspicion of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the match.
The police found the glasses on the site and said they had found Simpson's DNA on it, the CBS receives WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
He has a $350,000 bond, the Advocate said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying a gunshot wound to the head into the neck is the cause of death.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's refugee task force, the state's police crime lab, Southern University police and citizens of the area for helping in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the area's law enforcement team for its "intelligence and work to ensure justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-and-six-inch forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team had "broken their hearts" and were "appalled" after hearing of Wayde's death.
That's the kind of thing you worry about all the time.
The burning of fossil fuels in Mexico City
Ashes splashing from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention had warned the people of Mexico on Saturday not to get close to the volcano after the activity increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered over 24 hours.
The center monitored a number of earthquakes and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ashes covering the front windows of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in volcano activity 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is called "Don Goyo" and has been alive since 1994.
The U.S. government's decision to ban gay marriage has been delayed by a year since the country's independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two pro-independence protesters clashed with the anti-terror police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark one year since Catalonia's split vote on secession.
A group of people in masks who were in favour of segregation bludgeoned the counter-terrorist police who held them back with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be overcrowded with tourists.
There were also clashes later in the day, with police using their batons to control the fighting.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive" and unionist protesters shouted "Long life to Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries at the protests, according to the local press.
The tensions are still high in this area of independence, a year after the October 1 referendum in which Madrid was considered illegal but which was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose to become independent, but many did not come to vote and those opposed to secession had boycotted the vote significantly.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
A group of anti-government demonstrators gathered in front of the White House to protest the state's anti-abortion laws.
He was forced to move, but he was forced to follow a different path.
According to Narcis Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who was going to protest the separatists with his wife, he was no longer confident about gaining independence for Catalonia.
"Last year we had one of the best times ever.
I watched my parents cry with happiness when they were able to vote but we're back in the same old position now," he said.
Although they managed to secure a small but crucial victory in the regional elections in December last year, pro-independence groups have struggled to keep the momentum going this year and many of their best-known leaders have either exiled themselves or are waiting for a trial for helping to organise the referendum and declare independence after that.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on her phone in support of the police, politicians on both sides had been stirring up the waters during the collision.
The disparity is growing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after being driven into a house.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was driven several times into a house in Londonderry.
This happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage had been done to the gates and to the building itself.
A crossbow may have been shot to the head sometime too.
Menga's shot secures 1-0 victory for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory for Livingston
Livingston stunned the Rangers by beating Steven Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as Ibrox's club manager.
Dolly Menga's shot was the difference as Gary Holt's team rose to Hibernian level in a moment.
Gerrard's side haven't won a away game in the Premier League this season and are facing Hearts next Saturday, who are at the top and eight points ahead of them.
The Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has beaten six consecutive games in the division, and head coach Holt has not lost a game since he swapped Kenny Miler last month.
Houston's loss to the visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored and their directness caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his effort dragged across the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only aim his effort wide after slipping to meet Craig Halkett's header across the goal,
The home team was willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties to the others in certain places.
And that's how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers donated a free kick and Livingston worked to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson teaming up to help Menga, who kicked the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
By then, the Rangers were in control of the ball but couldn't break through the home side's defenders and goalkeeper Liam Kelly wasn't very concerned.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a save by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied at the feet of Allan McGregor, the Rangers' catcher, and Lithgow kicked the ball wide from another play set by Livingston.
Crossers were continually coming to Livingston's box and continued to be cleared, and two penalty kicks - after Halkett challenged the substitute, Glenn Middleton, and one for a handball - were ruled out.
‘Wonderful performance' by Livingston -
Alasdair Lamont, one of BBC Scotland's analysts at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's an amazing performance and a stunning result for Livingston.
They were great and they continue to raise expectations on this ascending path.
The style of their play and personnel has not changed much since they reached the top, but Holt must be commended for the way he has motivated the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, managing a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes through the game.
But the Rangers didn't have a lot of inspiration.
Although they played well at times under Gerrard's management, those standards were not to be seen.
They had little hold on their last ball - they only opened the home side once - and it was quite a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Welcome to Erdogan in Cologne.
It was a blue sky and everyone was smiling on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – a visit to try to improve the relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreed over issues including human rights, freedom in the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police had given security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters had come by the mosque to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who were against Erdogan – many of them Kurdish – made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
These matchmaking protests reflect the rift associated with the visitor, a man who is considered a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
A car crash in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident has occurred some months after another cyclist died in a ‘taro and flee' accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his next of kin.
Road closures and diversions have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in collision
Six officers have been injured in clashes at a men's high security prison, according to the Prison Office.
The incident took place at Her Majesty Long Lartin Prison at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and the case continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been called there to deal with the chase, which involves eight prisoners and takes place in just one avenue.
The injuries were inflicted by officers on their faces at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Prison staff with specialist training have gone there to deal with this incident which continues at Her Majesty's Prison Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are making it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend more time in prison."
Her Majesty's Prison Long Lartin is made up of more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June the prison governor was said to have been treated at the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, counter-terror officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious incident where the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens major flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City.
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as the rest of Hurricane Rosa travels across the Southwest Desert, causing a risk of major flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will be monitoring for major flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, turning into rain late on Monday night.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ boundaries."
The National Hurricane Center's latest models predict between 2 and 4 inches of rain, with a few rare examples of a total of up to 6 inches on the Arizona Mogollon Edge.
Other areas in the South West of the Desert including the Great Basin and the Rockies of mid-Wales are likely to have between 1 and 2 inches, with some cases potentially up to 4 inches in total.
For those who are not at risk of severe flooding, Rosa rain can be beneficial as they live in a dry area.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, it is likely that some of this rain will be beneficial because there are currently dry conditions in the South West.
According to the U.S. Dryness Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the highest category but one," he told weather.com.
Initially, the Rosa route will lead to land along the Baja peninsula of California, Mexico.
Rosa, which was still as strong as a Sunday morning hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving northward traveling 12 miles per hour.
The storm enters the colder waters of the Pacific so it weakens.
Because of this, the hurricane is expected to reach land in Mexico on the strength of a tropical storm this afternoon or Monday night.
The rains could be heavy over parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a low-pressure storm, which will then travel up through Arizona and into southern Utah arriving late Tuesday night.
"The main hazard to be expected from Rosa or the remnants of the hurricane is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwest Desert USA," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
This rain is expected to create major life-threatening flooding as well as a stream of rubble in the desert and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and one 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transported to hospital and remains there in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police have said.
Officers have asked anyone who has material on their mobile phone from what happened to present that evidence.
Trump says Kavanaugh has ‘suffered from hatred and anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to renounce the ruthless and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered from the anger and resentment" of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and was emboldened in denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he allegedly sexually abused her decades ago, and both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
The President said on Saturday that Kavanaugh's "people have seen the greatness and the quality and the courage" of the American people that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal workers of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding history of public service," she told the crowd of supporters in Northern Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when talking about the importance of the Republican assembly in the mid-term elections.
"There are five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our time.
"I'm not trying, but I'm trying really hard," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere trying to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is to "resist and prevent."
The first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the floor of Parliament is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them having been swept away as huge waves broke on the beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters hit the beach at nightfall, sweeping away many and killing them and damaging anything along the route.
The earthquake was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people were carrying on with their activities on the beach, they did not immediately run away from it and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesian disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a briefing meeting in Jakarta.
The tsunami was not alone, it was dragging cars, trunks, houses, it was hitting against everything on the land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 cya (497 mph) before hitting the edge of the beach.
Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disasters agency showed that many buildings and shops had been damaged, bridges had fallen and a mosque surrounded by water.
The protests continued to shake the city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area that contained 2.4 million people.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times larger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's agriculture, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have swelled the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "genuine" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under rubble of fallen buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and number of injured people could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggata, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"There was no means of communication with Donggala to obtain information", said Nugroho.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but the situation could worsen", he said.
The agency was criticised on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived in the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film shared on social media a man can be heard on a high floor yelling at people in the street below warning them that a tsunami was on its way.
Within minutes a wall of water was hitting the shore, carrying buildings and cars from there.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large electricity cut that extinguished the communications around Palu making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has started sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but those who have had to leave their homes really need food and other essentials.
The city's airport has been reopened only for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to go to the rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
Over 800 Killed in Indonesia's Tsunami Skill.
She's in a terrible situation.
While World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the workers are sheltered in tarpaulin shelters that have been placed in their office yard, they passed heart-breaking scenes on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
Things are very bad.
Even as aid groups have begun the relentless process of providing emergency assistance, some have complained that specialist foreign aid workers have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, no funding, supplies or staff can be provided unless the disaster site has been declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened again.
"It's still a disaster at the state level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government has said, 'yes, this is a national disaster,' we can get international aid, but there is no status yet."
As evening approaches in Palu for the second time following the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hope that their loved ones are alive by some miracle, which would alleviate some of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers were able to free a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, held earlier in the month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandagi said his pupils were among those stranded at the Roa Roa hotel.
"As someone with experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional cheek," he said.
During the hours after the paragliding community heard of the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, Mr. Gendon said he had sent a plethora of WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu who were taking part in the beach festival.
But there was only one grey tick next to his messages, rather than two blue ticks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 as ATM is refilled in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was retrieving an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM machine in the entertainment building, preparing to provide more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
When he was busy, another man "runs from behind the Brink employee" and steals a bag of money that was supposed to be provided.
Witnesses saw many others flee the scene, according to the statement, but police did not identify the number involved.
Anyone with information about who these people are should contact Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
On Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been known as Ye and used the name as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He goes on the show in place of Ariana Grande, the American singer who withdrew due to "emotional reasons", the creator of the show said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe that ‘ye' is the word most often used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you", West maddens earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with Big Boy, which he presents on the radio.
"So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
The name of Kanye, which means the only one, went to Ye alone – reflecting the good, the bad and the confusion, everything.
The album does more than reflect who we are."
There are a number of other famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has had various names like Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to collaborate with West, has also been using his name by varying it in terms of the capital letters.
U.S. military says it won't use force against civilians
Mexico's future President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use troops against citizens as the country celebrates the 50th anniversary of the bloody reprisal against students.
On Sunday in Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed to "never use the military to defeat the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at the plaza during a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing as many as 300 people, when left-wing student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support the young people of Mexico by providing subsidies to those studying and opening more public universities for free.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities meant that young people were drawn to crime gangs.
U.S. should double its funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double the money it spends on research in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements regarding artificial understanding, although the U.S. generally does not have a formal artificial understanding strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year, which is its goal of being the best country for all innovation by 2030.
"Ensuring double funding for artificial understanding research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far less advanced than the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial understanding," Lee said.
Double funding could mean doubling the opportunity to ensure the next major achievement in the field of artificial understanding is achieved in the USA, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee has published his book "Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he was working on an artificial understanding system and beat the best Othello player in America. He later became an executive officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge in the field of Defence, and asked when would be the next to help identify the next sights.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard in order to earn grants from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing the academic leaders; it's the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently sought to hire bright alumni from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes to the migration policy could help the U.S. reinforce its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should automatically be offered to people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The China National Institute of Natural Science provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Institute of Science and other government institutions provide funding to researchers from the USA, but the standard of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment in an enterprise called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in Research on Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been operational for months.
The citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum on the country's future
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a dispute that has lasted decades with Greece, which had prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and has prevented the country from becoming part of NATO and the European Union.
Both governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt over whether the number of voters will meet the 50 per cent target needed to validate the referendum.
The referendum question is: "Are you in favour of becoming a member of NATO and the EU and accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Those in favour of changing the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order for Macedonia, one of the only countries to develop after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to have access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because that ensures safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although they are not legally bound, enough members of parliament have said that they will wait for the result of the vote in order to make it a decisive vote.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority would have to be held in parliament.
The province's election commission said it had not mentioned any irregularities by 1pm.
However, voting only made up 16 per cent, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 per cent of voters who had registered voted.
I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, a change that would allow the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small platform and placed chairs in front of tents that had been placed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join forces being able to hold our head high, not through the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says becoming a member of NATO will ensure a budget that Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is higher than 20 percent, really needs.
I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that the result of "yes" would "confirm our future."
According to a poll set up last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - which is lower than the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 per cent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, passes all the defenders of Brighton and gets a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smash Brighton defenders during Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It was a very easy goal for him as he scored in the 60th minute.
The Argentine striker got a bass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders, before reaching the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
One defender pushed away before running faster than many others at the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he gave a bass to his left, giving the ball to Sterling.
The England forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
Aguero is having some problems with his feet," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We've been playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at that time."
But Sterling gave Chelsea the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton territory that time.
He gave a lovely kick through the players along the backside to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times before guiding Sterling to the far post.
The Chelsea forward kicked the ball into the net before sliding over the boundaries.
Manchester City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
Since the Nationals don't have a chance to compete in the second-round games, there's not much reason to force another starter.
But Scherzer hopes to stand on Sunday's mound to face the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications when it comes to play-offs for the Rockies, who take the lead against the Los Angeles Dodgers of a single game in the NL West league.
The Rockies secured at least a second chance with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to secure their place in the first group.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can tread the rubber knowing that there will be a good atmosphere here with the crowd in Denver and that the other team will play at the highest level I would face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in such a game?"
The Nationals have not announced a starter for Sunday yet, but reportedly they wanted to let Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start for the 34th time, had a practice session on Thursday and would throw on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right-handed thrower who plays for Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 ‘strikeout' shots in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in Northern Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his selection for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of the Republic's assembly in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done in the past will be in the past.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big ones – I'm not trying but I'm trying real hard, that's why I travel everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group, you see this is happening now.
And they are determined to take back the power by using any means necessary, you see the hate, the malice.
They don't care who gets hurt, who has to trample on them for power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are trying to "resist and prevent."
"And we've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "fine and nasty and unpleasant and liars."
He referred to the name of the high-ranking Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein of the Parliamentary Judiciary Committee, and loud booing was heard among the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you share the document?
The, the, what.
No, no, wait a second - that was an example of poor body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer a burden.
People don't listen to the words they say.
When I was asked by my friends who were in the military to help me out, it was a huge surprise.
After all, I'm the latest of many Labour MPs to hear that we're not welcome - and that's for saying ours.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way because she stood firm against anti-semitism.
In my case, the motion of recriminations criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with him on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are issues similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders about.
The notice for the East Nottingham Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the Friday evening GC meetings have been such meetings.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings nowadays are not so nuanced and we have long forgotten the promise of "more kind, more tender" politics, whether that has ever been achieved.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour party and all views are criticised on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader. Co-workers who I used to think were of the same political nature as me were starting to expect me to do a U-turn and support positions I would never have agreed with otherwise – whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - it will lead to harsh attacks on social media calling for my non-election, condemning centre politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And it's not just me who has experienced this.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are aimed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professional and determined nature of those colleagues who face a lot of sexist or racist abuse every day but who don't let that get the best of them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is the way levels of abuse have been normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should build a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer such a broad-minded party and with every proposal of a "lack of confidence" or a change to the selection rules, the party becomes more narrow.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years encouraging me to keep my head down, not to express my opinion too much, then that I would be "right."
But that's not why I chose to be a lawyer.
I joined Labour as a school pupil 32 years ago, angered by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which was responsible for the dire state of the classroom of my comprehensive school. Since then I have sought to promote better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or as a minister in government.
I've never hidden my politics, nor in the last election either.
No one in East Nottingham would have been able to misunderstand my political views and the areas that I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader with the country moving towards a Brexit that will be a blow to households, to businesses and to our public services.
But, actually, I don't have a message for Nottingham Momentum, but a message for my constituents, Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that any number of threats of my non-election or political convenience won't stop me from acting in the way I believe is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Father unsatisfied at the top
Two late tries may have somewhat skewed the final result, but it is certain that Ayr deserved to win this Tennent Premier League match.
They are now at the top of the table, the only team not beaten by the ten.
In the end, their excellent defence work, as well as their opportunities advantaged, was responsible for the running of the home team and the coach, Peter Murchie, had every right to be proud.
We've had challenging games so far, but nobody has beaten us, so I have to be content," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Ayr must be commended, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, which was converted by Frazier Climo, ensured Ayr was in the lead. However, the yellow card that Scotland's Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, meant that Melrose was able to take advantage of that and Jason Baggot's unconverted try.
Climo ensured that Ayr was even more ahead with a penalty, before he, just before half-time, scored and converted an individual try to secure Ayr a score of 17-5 in the interval.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, which was converted by Baggott, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a bit of a delay because Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured, and was carried away on a stretcher. After they resumed, Ayr gained more success following a request by Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr's temporary captain, Blair Macpherson, got a yellow card, and again, Melrose made the extra player pay with an unconverted request from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty kick line, MacPherson put the ball down behind Ayr's increasing scrums.
Climo converted the try, as he did again almost immediately after restarting, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box-kick and sent forward Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth try.
Star Still Game looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, one of the stars of Still Game, is hoping to move into the hospitality industry after he found out he had been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the hit BBC show, as well as writing and acting alongside comedian Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the forthcoming ninth series will be the final series in the show's history and it is likely that Kiernan is planning for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan hoped to be part of the "successful restaurant trade" in Glasgow.
‘We don't own the sea': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol the naval headquarters of cladin rigio in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue flag like the sea.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right.
His recovery is a duty."
Bolivia is surrounded and the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody collision over resources in the 19th century is still alive - as is the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are clearer than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a verdict from the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has momentum, a sense of unity and calm, and of course she is confident in waiting for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A number of Bolivian citizens will be watching the verdict of the international court of justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in the Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim - after decades of intermittent talks - that Chile must negotiate to give Bolivia an aperture to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president - facing a controversial fight for next year's vice-presidential election - is highly dependent on the ruling on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favour - and not much would change if the court did.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory, and has insisted it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the verdict of the international justice court came only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests "that the case was not a complicated one," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean man who specialises in international law.
And instead of improving Bolivia's case, the last four years may have made the case worse.
"The current Bolivian administration has disrupted this issue related to access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales's warring rhetoric has undermined any goodwill that Chile had left, he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process is usually a quick process.
Bolivia will have "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement over mutual benefits," he said.
Also, Calzadilla denied that Marales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the maritime issue as a political ploy.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
It's an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says it will not remove its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never get rid of its nuclear weapons unless the member trusts Washington first.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.
He called on the United States to stick to the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the country's leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears set to resume nuclear diplomacy that would not be able to reach an agreement, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the idea that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to an end to the Korean War will only dream of a witch hunt is going to make the North surrender.
Washington is barred from agreeing to the declaration before Pyongyang makes significant disarmament moves first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is much doubt as to whether Pyongyang is serious about surrendering weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the latest collection of giant headscarves is about to reach your High Street
If you want another hat or you want to stop the sun altogether, this is the fashion for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a range of giant and striking headgear for their SS19 collection on the fashion stage, which shone on the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats have appeared on Instagram this summer and the extraordinary creations of these designers have been seen on the fashion stage.
One of Valentino's striking items was an oversized leather hat decorated with a wide, feathered edge covering the heads of the models.
Other great accessories included water melons decorated with gems, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple - but these hats wouldn't warm your head.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of strange masks - well in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had lips sewn together and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than to a sublime fabric.
One of them was like a scuba diver's costume with snorkel and goggles, and another looked like a ice cream cone, which melted.
And, if you enjoy big fashion declarations - here's your chance.
Those who keep track of style anticipate that huge coins could reach your high street.
These large hats follow the style of ‘La Bomba', the popular straw hats with the two-foot wide edge, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind these impractical hats featured on social media also had another major creation on the fashion stage - a straw bag almost as large as the model in a swimsuit that carried it.
The burnt orange rafter bag, decorated with a rafter edge and a white leather handle, was one of the most striking items in Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see large beach hats and bags arrive on the high street next summer - as the designer has made so much impression, it would be difficult to avoid the demand for large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, only underpinned by individual and collective success in the fields of sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, which are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a leading school curriculum, I see modern languages as still popular subjects being chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, that will stay in his memory.
If you talk to someone in their own language, that stays in the heart."
This is a powerful message to remind us that we cannot rely solely on the English language when it comes to building connections and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at this year's exam results recently, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables and contain the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages have achieved a high A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, shows that 72 per cent of pupils achieved an A-high in Mandarin, and 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish were awarded an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages, as subjects, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found a lack of language skills was responsible for 17 per cent of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies.
So, there is an increasing demand for languages in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities planned for languages, these skills are essential in a global environment.
No matter what career someone chooses, if that individual has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future of having such a long-term skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will mean that a bilingual person will be immediately a step ahead.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 73 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. In addition, French was the only language spoken by a double figure percentage of 15 per cent.
This is the reason why investing in language teaching is important for children today.
The acquisition of many languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, but other schools will be teaching languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking at 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages they can choose from in independent schools, and the schools will include teaching staff who specialise in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will equip children with the skills needed to succeed, whatever lies ahead.
There is no denying that, in a global business environment, languages are still vital to the future of the country, so that must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
I need to be well looked after.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the series before the start of the season on Sunday receiving the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he has not decided how many minutes he will play again.
"It will be more than one but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers' coach, Mike Trudell, gave a message on Twitter saying it was likely James will play a few minutes.
After a practice session earlier in the week, James was questioned about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"At this stage in my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Time Rally West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including visits and friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice for the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking to garner support for the midterm elections as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump's rally is in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below using a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the hearings this week for his nomination to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who is under stress as a result of allegations of sexual misconduct with the vote to confirm him in parliament postponed for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans facing hard-fought elections in November to gain some momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign said the five rallies over the next week would aim to "stimulate volunteers and supporters as the Republicans seek to protect and add to the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president can travel to as many states as possible as or start the important campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Being held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get noticed by Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the last month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come here to try and boost him in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: USA team shows the puck to fight on as they go to Sunday's individual games
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's quartet could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum pendulum is a concept that has been imagined in the sporting world but it is a concept that the players believe in especially in competitions like this.
Where would you say it is at the moment?
"They were ahead by six points and now it's four, so we've got a bit of momentum I guess," Spieth said as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the plain with another eleven to play.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel they have a little bit of wind in their mood and have enough to cheer them up, especially by Speith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and got three points out of four each.
He has been a great help to you, and he has been a great example to you.
The screams of celebration got louder as his round went on, he managed with a vital pitch to go on a game to four each although he and Thomas had been down two after two.
There was a similar scream after the puck that won them the game on the 15, the kind of scream that tells you he doesn't believe America is out of it yet.
"You've got to focus and worry about your own game," said Speith.
This is the only thing these players have after now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the untold story of the Ryder Cup.
"There's only four of us in the world, four of us, and we can't do anything about it."
"Moliwood" was the only bar not to have bogging on Saturday afternoons, and they didn't have bogging on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons or the last nine on Friday mornings either.
That run, and a way in which the energy flows between them and the crowd confirm that they are the players to beat on Sunday, who would be the one player more popular to confirm Europe's victory as their right falls over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible both on the same price on different holes.
But, it's an early rush to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily beat Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Following bogies and two doubles in the first nine the Spaniard and Swede were in a hole they came not close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday there's no one to help you out of your hole.
There are four paylines and the interesting mod quartets to watch because of the relationships between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
So far Europe has played better as a team and they lead by bit at the start of a final day, but the quadrennial session has proved that Team USA has the ability to fight, something that some especially in the USA doubted.
Europe ahead of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a significant advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday's four-ball and quarterfinals 10-6 ahead of the USA.
The incredible duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two victories over Tiger Woods to take their score at Le Golf National to four points.
European squad Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to regain the trophy after losing it to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the poor American squad in the morning's four balls taking the series to 3-1.
The U.S. gave more opposition in the fourties, but they could not get rid of the defection.
Jim Furyk's squad needs eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points after each other and he and Molinari, who have been called "Molliwood" after an incredible weekend, are the second bar to have four points from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls they worked together brilliantly to beat Woods on Bryson Dechambeau's American rucksack of 5 and 4.
Wood, who dragged himself two games on Saturday, had some outstanding opportunities but has lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and a quarter and seven in a row.
Justin Rose returned as a partner to Henrik Stenson in the quartets and beat first and third in the world of 2 and 1's Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka.
All in all, it wasn't a good day for Europe on a sunny and windy day in the south west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won by 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four balls and later they beat both Polter and Rory McIlroy in the 4 and 3 in the quarterfinals after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from being four points behind at the start of the individual games, although the Furyk squad only need an equal score as they are the holders of the trophy.
But, after being second for two days, coming back on Sunday looks as if it's beyond her ability.
North Korea says they won't be unilaterally disarmed without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said the UN value that the ongoing sanctions strengthens suspicion in the U.S. and that the country will not unilaterally remove its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the international organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill steps" in the past year, such as ceasing nuclear exercises and missiles, decommissioning the site of nuclear experiments, and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons or nuclear technology.
But we do not see such a response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without trust in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances we cannot de-arm ourselves first."
Although Ri had repeated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's resistance of a gradual response to de-nuclearization where its North Korea will be rewarded when it adopts gradual steps, his statement was to see significant as it did not reject unilateral de-nuclearization entirely as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement between Kim John Un and Donald Trum at the first conference between the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trum pledged to guarantee the security of Korea.
North Korea has been trying to get a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls to ease the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. demands to have "de-nuclearized first" and they increase the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve their goal in a mandatory manner, and they even oppose the "declaration to end the war," RI said.
"It's a dream come true for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions strengthen our suspicions."
Ri did not mention plans for a second conference between Kim and Trump, a conference the president had mentioned at the United Nations a week earlier.
Instead, the minister noted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five days and added: "If South Korea were to be the party to the denuclearisation issue and not the USA, the denuclearisation of the beautiful Korean peninsula would not lead to such an impossible situation."
Ri's speech however was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US with North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Bad President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a self-regulatory mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to de-arm, but said there was still a lot of work to do and that the sanctions had to wait until North Korea was de-nuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a set timeframe for this, saying "if it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are arguing that the UN General Assembly should reward Pyongyang for the actions that have been taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday: "Security Council sanctions must be strictly enforced and flawless until we realise and confirm a completed denuclearisation.
The Security Council unanimously lifted sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to try to limit funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Ri met with Pompeo on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second conference.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go so well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying there had been progress, but for North Korea to accuse him within hours of making "commands like a gangster."
North Korea has promised to meet with Moon this month in order to dismantle a missile and nuclear site if the U.S. takes "match action."
He said Kim had told him that the "matching actions" he was asking for were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moves towards normalizing the relationship with the US.
Harvard students have a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting its undergraduates to sleep more in order to try to combat the macho culture of studying through the night using caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world's best university are often misunderstood when it comes to the essentials of looking after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital who has designed the course, a course he believes is the first of its kind in the USA.
He was inspired at the start of the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
‘At the end of the lecture a girl came up to me and said: ‘Why is it that only now do I get to know this, in my last year?'
He said that no one had told him about the importance of sleep - which was a surprise to me," she told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being delivered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university had decided to roll out the course after finding out that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
‘We are aware that it will not immediately change the behaviour of the students.
But we think they have a right to be told - just as you have a right to be told what the impact of smoking is on your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of being proud to stay up all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is an increasingly growing problem,
Making sure you get enough quality sleep should be a way for students to tackle stress, tiredness and anxiety, he says - even to avoid putting pressure on, as lack of sleep makes the brain think you're hungry, making you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped design the course, having studied one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to try and get the course for the whole campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar scheme of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm for going to sleep, as well as for waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light' released by electronic screens and LED light, which can affect your circadian rhythm leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: goal by Menga beats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another poor away defeat as Dolly Menga's 1-0 defeat to Steven Gerrard's side at Livingstone.
The Ibrox team were looking for their first win on the road since beating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for only the second time in 18 games as manager to leave the team eight points behind senior Ladbrokes side Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and the Rangers team was short of inspiration and no prospect of being able to come equal.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingstone rises to third just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after lurker Calum Spence had to undergo treatment for a head injury after something was thrown from the visitors' head.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr to reach the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt stayed with the 11 who beat Hearts last week and would be delighted with the way his organised squad defeated their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may have dominated in terms of possession but Livingstone did more with the ball when she had them.
They should have scored after just two minutes after Menga's pass gave Scott Pittman a chance on an Allan McGregor goal but the midfielder failed to take his chance by hitting the ball clear.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could not hit the clear at the back post.
Rangers dominated but there was more hope than belief in their play in the final crane of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have had a kick from the penalty after about a quarter of an hour after he and Steven Lawless hit but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers got two shots for the target in the first half but found former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's shot.
Although Livi's goal after 34 minutes had been against the run of play, no one can argue that they only deserved it for their hard work.
Again, Rangers failed and Jacobs's deep play and plans failed.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm when he passed it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard was as braked as he changed Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change almost immediately had an effect as the winger passed to Morelos but Kelly rushed from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a sort of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's car could have added to their score in the final minutes but McGregor rose well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow missed a header from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another try for a kick from the spot after a collision with Jacobs but Thomson again ignored the try.
Almanac: Geiger Meter Inventor
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and in November... the day on which the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of finding and measuring particles, a development that would eventually lead to a device called the Geiger Meter.
An important part of science since then, the Geiger Meter also became an important part of popular culture, as in the film "Bells of Coronado" of 1950, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starring as highly unlikely scientists.
Me: "Is that the world?"
Rogers: "Geiger meters, it is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms released by the radiation in the minerals."
"Oh, well, it makes a lot of noise!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the device that was named after him continues to be in use.
New cancer vaccine can teach immune system to ‘see' foreign cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see' foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise foreign cells as part of treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and modifying them in a laboratory
Then they will be able to ‘see' a protein that is common in many cancers and they will be reinjected
Testing of the vaccine shows hopeful results in patients and different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who is learning the immune system to recognise foreign cells, saw your ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and modifying them in a lab so that they can ‘see' a protein called HER2 that is common in several cancers, and then reinfect the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 is "the cause of the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and bowel/arterial cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and ‘learning' them how to target cancer cells has worked to treat types of leukemia.
After his appearance on SNL, Kanye West began a speech from Trump's party wearing a MAGA cap.
She didn't do well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the Presidency in 2020.
After performing his third gig that night, Ghost Town, wearing Make America Great Again's chopsticks, he railed against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I'll talk to a white person and they'll say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
"If I had to worry about my future, I'd be leaving the United States for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch involving Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee regarding allegations of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a video of West laughing was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West by posting it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had been bullied behind the stage for what he was wearing on his head.
"They put me on the back burner.
They said, ‘don't go out with the cap on.'
They've been bugging me!
Then they say I'm in a low place," he said, then told the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the low place?" saying that he would "put my Superman helmet on, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try to find love."
His comments were booed at least twice by an SNL audience and cast members were unpleasant to see, Variety reported, with the same person telling the publication: "The studio went completely silent."
West had been added as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, as her ex-boyfriend the rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West caused confusion to many by performing the song I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest characters: THANK YOU FOR WORTHING THE HORSE."
However, West tweeted that West was "just being himself and that's great."
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who in my opinion embraces and declares ideas that are harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so do we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his new name was "the being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who has also been called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
It was with rapper Snoop Dogg that he got the name Snoop Lion and of course the late musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has died of a heart attack
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has killed off the stereotype of a macho hero, saying such roles on the screen mean that young boys feel they have to be hard to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed something had gone wrong and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who also recently married fellow actress on Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, admits he feels strongly for tackling the problem.
‘I feel strong at the minute - what has gone wrong with masculinity?,' he said.
‘What have we been teaching men as they grow up, in terms of the problem we have now?'
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very male characters.
He went on: ‘What is instinct and what is teaching?
What is being taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel that they have to be a special kind of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong with young men.'
In the interview he admitted that he would not do any other Game of Thrones programs when the series ends next summer, saying that he had ‘lost enough on fights and horses'.
From November Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West which is a story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said meeting his wife Rose was the best thing to come from Game of Thrones.
‘I met a woman on the programme, so in a way she gave me my family and my life from now on,’ she says.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend who is Kit's character, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and Aids.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering.
Around 40,000 new cases were identified in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the cases were transmitted through sex, indicating a change from the past.
HIV has traditionally spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood supplies.
But the number of people holding HIV like this has been reduced by almost nothing, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But, year-on-year, the number of people in China living with HIV and Aids has increased by 100,000 people.
It's a big problem in China with a large number of immigrants.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rampant.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transfers of the infections are the result of inadequate sex safety in these relatives.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that a member of staff had released the Republicans' senators' data, killing on ‘dangerous grounds' and ‘conspiracy theories'
On Saturday Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted information about three Republican Senators to the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles demanded that the accusations be spread by "extreme right wing" pundits.
"Claims, lies, and more lies," said Walters in a statement to Twitter.
The information released included the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information spread online on Thursday, after being posted by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during a hearing by a panel of Parliament on charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh who has been nominated to the Supreme Court.
The information was released after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Pedestrian websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address indicating the source of the postings was linked to Waters' office and they released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This groundless charge is wrong and a naked lie," Waters said.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and inaccurate allegations - had no responsibility in any way for releasing this information.
"This is a false statement and a false statement."
Waters' statement was criticized by the online press quickly, including by former press secretary at the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is infuriating," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the nature to be a Member of Congress.
When a man is accused of something he has not done, he cannot be angry.
They can't be religious.
They cannot question the prosecutor's motives.
They need to be quiet and calm."
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing angry during a Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Well, if it's true," he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had informed "the appropriate authorities and the law enforcement agency of the fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure the perpetrators are exposed," he said, "and are held accountable for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new British-biased film and it seems fitting for this revival of the comedy parody series Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a way to tell the difference between how much we're willing to pay for a new home?
In any case, the incomparable Johnny English has been licensed to ruin everything back for the second time - with his name above all showing that he is a comic character created for cinemagoers in non-English speaking countries.
Of course this is the silly spy who despite his noble claims includes a little bit of Clouseau, Mr Bean, on a man who contributed one note to by Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
Originally based on the mysterious traveler and man Atkinson played in a Barclaycard advert, leaving destruction behind.
There are one or two good scenes in the latest Johnny English movie.
I loved seeing Johnny English go towards a helicopter wearing armor and the rotor blades hitting against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is evident, but the humour is weak and unnecessarily bizarre, especially now that "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as an element of their films.
The humour feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's misadventures aren't as clever and specific as Atkinson's quiet jokes in Bean's persona.
The good news is that Great Britain is in a big mess.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's secret network of spies, freeing up the identity of all the spies Britain has in the field, despite concern for the undercover officer on duty - an unfortunate and minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final step for a self-righteous and surrounded, self-proclaimed prime minister who is already suffering from massive political unpopularity. Emma Thompson is doing her best with the character Teresa Mayan but there is little in the script to work with.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that all spies have been compromised and that she will need to bring someone out of retirement.
And this means Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster at some grand institution, but gives secret lessons on how to be a spy: some good jokes here, as English has a spy school similar to School of Rock.
English is transported back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to an underwater ship commander, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is shattered.
So the Batman and Robin of getting things wrong are back on Her Majesty's service, encountering Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is busy being charmed by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can deal with Britain's computer problems: Jason Vola is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous journey: dressed up as waiters, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant; create chaos while trying to board a luxurious Volta ship; and English causes complete chaos when trying to use a Virtual gadget to get used to the inside of Volta's house.
They make a great show of it in the final scene, but despite being so fun and unruly, there's a bit of a children's TV feel to it all.
Very nice.
And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't stop thinking: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes a fair play with his talents?
Labour denies preparing a plan for the British people to work for four days a week but being paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see the British people work a week from four days - but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would mean that employees get a three-day weekend - but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of the workers.
A change to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A high source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: ‘a policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight but a four-day week is an ambition that fits with the party's approach to restructure the economy in favour of the workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, at this time, not all of the work is done by volunteers.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: ‘There is no working week of four days in the party's policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's party conference to broaden his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from ‘anonymous directors' and ‘privileged' of the public resources companies.
The opposition's chancellor plans also mean that existing shareholders of water companies will not get all their money back as a Labour government could make ‘decisions' on the basis of apparent corruption.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create inclusive Ownership Funds to put 10 per cent of company equity in the hands of the private sector, which would receive annual instalments of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question whether the FBI findings could cause any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, Senator Scott Pelley asked ‘Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could devise something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was to see more openly than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I phoned him after this happened, after the allegations came out, I said, ‘Did you do this?'
He was decisive, determined and unambiguous."
However, Graham's vote is to be seen firmly.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and he would take a terrible charge," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett totally denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one to whom she names could confirm it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizenship Festival, an annual musical event with an impressive list of stars taking part and an equally striking message: get rid of poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizenship Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and also to raise awareness of the festival's primary intention to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Plan, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or anything else valuable to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizenship Festival been with just 12 years after reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to persuade people to demand change or just another case of "clicktivism" - people who feel they are making a difference by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizenship Festival says they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their fans, aiming for a variety of goals.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies amounting to $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group made reference to 390 commitments and announcements that stemmed from their actions, of which at least $10 billion had been classed u or raised.
The group estimates that the funding confirmed so far has had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and activist partnership committed to "helping children reach their full potential," pledging to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 47,000 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With help from the UK government, contributors, state governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social unfairness and malnutrition a footnote in history," Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition's missionary, told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group said the government had announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritious food, after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions and their website was "what makes you think we can get rid of extreme poverty?
The Global Citizenship Festival replied: "It will be a long and hard path - sometimes we fall and sometimes we fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for a "warning" to block Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington "if necessary" can use the Navy to block energy from Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's intervention in Syria - in particular, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to deal in energy as they mean to do in Eastern Europe, and southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to address this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that sea routes are open, and, if necessary, to place a siege, to make sure that their energy doesn't hit the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a not-for-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the USA.
He compared Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure and replace fuel," he said noting that Russia's economy is completely dependent and fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump government seeks to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest option of flooring for consumers in Europe.
To that end Trump's government officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" plan of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which according to Trump makes Berlin "a slave" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly reiterated that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is only an economic project worth $11 Billion and that will double the existing capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's sharp opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"In my view we share the belief that energy cannot be used to put pressure and that the consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has provoked a harsh response from Germany, which has affirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "Thinking Hard" Applying for the Presidency in 2020, Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider it hard" to run for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said.
"After November 6, I will consider it hard to apply for the presidency."
Warren gave her opinion about Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm concerned in my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course we need an investigation by the FBI before voting."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's constituents do not think she should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "likely" voters said the senator should not stand by the poll of the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Political Research Center's poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such an attempt.
The poll showed much greater support for an attempt by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a possible attempt and 48 per cent against.
The other Democratic nominees who have been mentioned as potential candidates in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, trounced a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with the murder of a
"What my son is suffering, what he is suffering from coming back, I can sympathize with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds some of our soldiers are returning with," he told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other former soldiers, "they come back differently, they come back harder and they come back asking if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all other members of the armed forces have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assault of a woman of domestic violence, intervening in a domestic violence report and possessing a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support new asylum policy challenge
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that rejects leeway for victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives of the 18 states and DC presented a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who were gang members" had mistreated her but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
He was held in custody in Texas.
The state's attorneys supporting Grace El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce many asylum seekers in the U.S., described the countries facing major problems with domestic violence and gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a decision made in 2014 by the Emigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented migrants to apply for asylum if they fled domestic violence.
District of Columbia State Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy was "ignoring decades of provincial, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that any application for asylum be determined on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle conflicts with that principle," the court-appointed brief said.
The attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy of banning access to migrants harms the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to be entrepreneurs and to "provide necessary labour."
State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered that migration judges do not give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Settlement is available to individuals who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylum wasn't meant to alleviate all the problems - until now the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
A desperate rescue attempt is foiled as the deaths double in the race to find survivors.
To the survivors, the situation was increasingly critical.
"It feels very anxious," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was comforting her sick son in a migration center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances and bodies come in.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their homes that had been destroyed, searching through their wet properties, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were crowded.
Some of the patients, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu military hospital, where they were being treated outdoors due to strong aftershocks.
Tears came to his eyes as he talked about feeling the earthquake shaking the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he was sharing with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed to the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of bullying with ‘propaganda notices'
A week after one of China's official newspapers ran a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump made reference to the attachment of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the most popular newspaper of the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, accusations that China denies.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections was a new step in an ambitious campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place trade promotion notices, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting a growing trade war that has led to the two countries imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tolls early in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states such as Iowa that support the Trump Republican Party, experts from the US and China said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "that China now confirms that bullying by running propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's important tradition of freedom of opinion and freedom of the press by placing a notice that they have paid for in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the downstairs newspaper stand here in Beijing, you would find it difficult to find non-consensual voices and you would not see a very reflection of the various ideas that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic path, as the press is under the tutelage of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's foremost newspapers has rejected the proposal to publish" his article, although he did not say which paper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating women who vote before the mid-term elections, with the exception of Kavanaugh.
As a number of progressive Republicans backed the nomination to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the charge of several charges of sexual misconduct, analysts have warned that they will see a response, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this have been very high, and the majority of Republicans on the record already say they want to proceed with the vote.
You can't withdraw these things," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's (G-Arizona) last-minute effort to get an FBI investigation into the case would be enough to silence unhappy voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate courtroom as the Republicans in control of the Judicial Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is going to be immense," Stu Rothenburg, an impartial political analyst, told the news website.
"People say they're enthusiastic already; that's true.
But it could increase, particularly among unsecured women on the outskirts of towns and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who although not fond of the president often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her accusations of sexual violence against the nomination to the Supreme Court, analysis suggested there would be a strong reaction if the Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"This has developed into a complete mess for the Republicans," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republicans' National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"This is only about the committee's vote or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and the way they've handled it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities ISA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But it seems that Americans are divided as to who to censure following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a few more alongside Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents are certain or believe Ford's evidence, while 35% say they are certain or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believe for sure or it is likely that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the Flake investigation, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford gave evidence on an oath before the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court, exposed his sexual organs to her while they were at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor Intends to Start a New Internet in order to Fail with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology pioneer Inrupt's new project is a company building on the open source platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee denied that the Inrupt company's intention was to "control the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the company.
"It's a historical event."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists to make, calendar, music library and other personal and professional resources.
It's so that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and to with at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it's up to the user completely who gets to see what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to Company Chief Executive John Bruce, is for the company to bring appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the resources available on the Inrupt website.

Bernard Vann: Celebrating the clergy of the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a fighter in the First World War has been celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vanny won an award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a secret shooter four days later, not knowing that he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was extremely symbolic that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the feat that won him the prize for his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1928 Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog and attacks by field guns and machine guns."
He later rushed to the firing line and with the "greatest courage" led the line forward before rushing to a field gun alone and grounding three of the crew.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were something "that I could never compare but that subdues someone."
He and his brother Dr James Vann laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to be part of the parade" adding "that real hero courage is shown by the support that is given by so many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pink in its place
Imagine this, you've stayed on your feet all night to watch Bellator 206 just to be banned from watching the main show.
The event from San Jose featured 13 matches, including a cheque on the main card and was shown live through the goal in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face each other, the UK viewers were left shocked as the screen changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy about the fact that they had to stay on their feet all night especially to watch the match.
One fan on Twitter described the change to a children's cartoon as "some kind of bad joke."
"Government regulations said the content didn't fit after 6 a.m. so it had to change to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would work on their schedule to include viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think when we think about the replay, we can make it work," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won't be able to deal with this until Sunday is our time, Monday is their time.
But we're working on it.
I tell you the truth, when the programs changed there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought there was a technical problem.
But that was not the problem, it was a government issue.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We'll have to keep it to five matches instead of six - as is usual - we tried to give the fans too much and it was a long run.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘isolated' because of his sexuality
Plumber Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old plumber said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs to be presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of gays in order to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent has made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, has taken several months break due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up "because it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, feeling different, have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so that he didn't disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he had expressed his views because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without implications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "has been unexpected."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age gap has never been an issue.
"When someone goes through so much at a very young age" he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had lived through similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything would have been for a gold medal," he said.
"There are more important things than winning gold medals.
"My hero is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept he was going to die and that the last thing he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 again - he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him ‘you're not going to be around to be in the good front row'," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing that I recognised that he wasn't invincible," she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had resonated with him before the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who isn't on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phill Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to improve his standard to avoid an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the 12th time, was put on the bench by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for the pennant and quarterfinals.
Rather than being in the middle of the activity, as it has been so often to the United States, five-time major Mickelson split his day between being a fan and working on his game in the hope of improving the problems he has.
As the straightest of drivers wasn't even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old isn't a good choice for a Le Golf National tight course, where the long rough punishes nostalgic shots.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickleson, in Sunday's ninth match is the face of British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12 singles matches, had a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, though he could do nothing else.
"He understood the role he had today, he beat my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has added so much to these moments in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was anticipating more, but like then she has worked out and like then we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached the highs of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk says his presence is an intangible boost for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, he's a great person to have in the team room," she explained.
"I think the young players are having fun making fun of him too, this week, it was nice to see.
It's a lot more than just awareness."
Thomas Bjorn's Europe captain knows that a big advantage can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of individual games in the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danes had their first game at Valderrama in 1997, where a team captained by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but by the finish line the advantage was down to a close with Europe winning from 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
Remind yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won but only narrowly," said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 team win 5 to 3 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10 to 6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You have to do your best tomorrow.
Go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the trophy, and that's where we'll focus.
I've said since the start, I'm focused on the 12 players in our squad, but we're also aware of what stands out - the best players in the world."
Delighted with the way his players have performed on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be proud of this.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come to the fore, and that's a completely different thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there on your own, you're tested to the limit as a golfer.
That's the message that needs to be given to the players, which is to do your best tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best too."
Unlike Bjorn, captain Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk has been at both ends in the major victories on the final day, as he was part of the team that won at Brookline before losing after Europe secured the "Worth at Medinah."
"I remember every word of it," he said after being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, boosted his players before the final day.
"We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to start quickly as you've seen at Brookline, as you've seen at Medinah.
When the momentum goes in one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those games in the middle.
We're setting our line so we're putting the guys out there the way we want to, we're trying to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other European players in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of players in this order because I think they'll work well all the way," Bjorn said of his selection for the individual games.
The Battle of New Orleans was fought again
A new German naval frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold war era, but will not be available until at least next year due to faulty systems and an increasing cost, local media said.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper referring to a spokesman for the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will reportedly include a powerful cannon, rows of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles along with some mystery technologies, such as radar signature, infrared and smaller sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the new frigates should be able to be manned for up to two years away from their home ports.
But continued delays mean that the pioneering warships - which will allow ‘Germany to throw its power over the sea' - will be left behind by the age by which they will begin service, Die Zeit said.
The F125 frigate made headlines last year, after the German Navy refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to shipbuilders after she was delivered.
The reasons behind the ship's return were not clear, but German media referred to a number of essential "software and hardware deficiencies" which meant that the warship was good to nothing if she had to fight.
Software shortages were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be run by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the numbers on the Bremen class frigates.
Also, it became apparent that the ship was over her weight arduous which worsened her performance and diminished the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be 7,000 tons heavier than similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Aside from the faulty hardware, the price for the entire project - including the crew training - is starting to be a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from €2.2 billion to start.
The problems of the new frigates are becoming ever more important given recent warnings that German naval power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy was "running out of deployable ships."
The official said that the problem had worsened over time, as old ships had been decommissioned without new ships having been provided in their place.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the hidden lives of bats
New research is being carried out on an estate in the Scottish Highlands which aims to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique mammals and will help with future conservation activities.
The study by the scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will follow the least common bat on a soprano bat along with long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the site to keep track of bat activity throughout the season.
Volunteers and NHS staff will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert audio analysis of the recordings will detect the call frequency of the bats and what species do what.
A report and habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed landscape size picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the National Trust of Scotland, hopes the results will show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
The information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how to manage forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their roosts and leads to habitat loss.
Wind and lightning turbines can also be dangerous, along with insect trapping paper and some chemicals in building materials, and attacks by cats.
The owls are not blind.
But because they hunt at night their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching their food.
They use a sophisticated eco-learning technique to visualize prisms and obstacles that are in front of them.
The National Trust owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and over 76,000 hectares across the country and are deeply concerned about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who conduct regular surveys, visits to roosts and from time to time to save.
The organisation has established Scotland's first bat sanctuary on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The manager of the stop David Thompson said that the landscape of the stop was perfect for them.
Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other sites will help us understand more about what's needed for them to thrive."
It emphasises the search for bats before any building maintenance is carried out as destroying a single maternity gate could kill up to 400 female and young bats, potentially killing the whole local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their roosts.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Bat Conservation Trust officer, has been urging the public to give a hand.
He said: "We have a great deal to learn about our bats and with many of our species we don't know if their populations are doing well or not.
Ronaldo dismisses accusations of violence as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of violence against him "false news," saying that people "wanted to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward has been charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
In, he is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were announced, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news" her player, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel because of the allegations, which they have called "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in a private matter," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "a moral damage of an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious crimes in terms of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are alleged to have returned to the player's room, where he raped her anally, according to papers filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the claimed incident and told her that he "99 y can" was a "good man" who was disappointed by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga claims she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court arrangement because she was "fear of reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to reverse the arrangement as she continues to be harmed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: The UK would regret the loss of car makers forever
The UK would "forever regret" if it lost its status as a world leader in car production post-Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He said he was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC they would stop producing temporary cars at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a plan," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said delays at the border could lead to job losses in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The factory in Burnaston - which builds Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year and nearly 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion if Britain fell out of the EU at the end of March construction would stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without a deal on trade across the border, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, have said they will close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are around what the carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for cars built on order.
If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March there could be problems at the border, problems the industry says would lead to delays and lack of pieces.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than two days of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so the construction would have to be halted.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU "has been carefully drawn up to avoid those border checks."
We need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity," he told Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with a series of delivery chains that have been very successful."
Toyota could not say for how long the production would end, but in the long term, it warned that additional costs would affect the factory's ability to compete and that it would ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union convenor at the factory, said: "From my experience once these jobs have gone they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have offered a detailed and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again, the White House has said.
Donald Trump's important meeting with deputy state attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the fight for the nomination to supreme court Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, connections between Trump's aides and Russia and a possible obstruction of justice from the president.
Whether Trump will dismiss the deputy state attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been the same on Washington's tongue for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a device to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, as it was rumored he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not to" dismiss Rosenstein but the meeting was then adjourned to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, gave evidence.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
He said of the meeting with Rosenstein: “There is no date set for that yet, it could be this week. I can see that being delayed for another week because of all the other things that happen in the supreme court.
But we'll see and I always like to give the press the latest information."
Some reporters would doubt that claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace explains why.
Sanders said the lack of briefing was not the reason for TV journalists to "hate" him, although he said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they're overdoing it."
Then he suggested that the direct link between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without quoting any evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
Sanders said briefing would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the US president, that's far better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you have seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks. This will be a substitute for holding a press briefing where you can talk to the US president.”
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting presidents.
Individual conventions for the press are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed why, while making a bizarre and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers in Scotland's NHS amid concerns over Brexit
The Health secretary has written to EU staff working for NHS Scotland to express their appreciation in the country wishing them to stay there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Member of the Scottish Parliament sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay for the costs of applying for settled status for EU citizens working for the devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, and decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the UK government has also been toughening preparations for the possibility of a ‘no deal' situation.
I know this is a difficult time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of all staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie suffers a stroke after suffering a head injury
Lineback Christian Abercrombie who plays for the Tennessee State Tigers has had an emergency operation after suffering a head injury as the team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31 points to 27 on Saturday, according to Tennessee Senator Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Rees told reporters the injury had happened just before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and sort of collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and escorting him back for further assessment.
An official from the State of Tennessee told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operation at Vanderbilt medical center.
Harris added that there were "no details on the type of injury or how bad the injury is yet" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year red shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after he was transferred from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before being forced to leave the game, bringing the total tackles for the season to 18.
Buyers from abroad will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to support the homeless under new schemes from the Tories.
This proposal will neutralise the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp duty will be applied to those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that overseas buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay UK tax. The extra money will boost the Government’s intention to tackle rough sleepers.
The overpayment - which is in addition to the existing stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second and buy-to-let homes - can be as much as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this offer to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of brand new properties in London are bought by residents from outside the UK, increasing prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to step onto the housing ladder.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital- have turned into "uninhabited towns" because so many buyers from abroad spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to stop quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing woes."
Mr Corbyn has announced an impressive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and an end to turning people from their homes "without blame."
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year, I said I would dedicate my work as prime minister to restoring the British dream - that life would improve for all new generations.
And that means repairing our lackluster housing market.
Britain will always open its doors to people who want to live, work and create a life here."
However, it can't be right that buying houses is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, as it is for hard-working British residents.
For far too many people, the dream of owning a house is far from within their reach, and the embarrassment of sleeping out on the street remains far too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland."
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says that his "ultimate ambition" is to be the manager of the Scotland team.
The 42-year-old is desperate for the challenge of resurrecting the North-West club, who are currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a gap B and that's it," Ross told Sportsound, a BBC Scotland programme.
"When I was a child, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden quite a bit with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me back.
I'm going to take advantage of that opportunity, if I'm successful in managing a club."
Among Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no fear of succeeding in such a big club, having rejected previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich.
"Success for me at the moment will see ‘can I lead this club back to the Premier League?'"
Because of the structure and facilities of the club, it belongs to the Premier League without a doubt," he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task to get the club there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself successful unless I could get the club back there."
It's only been three years since Ross began his managerial career, following a spell as a vice-manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell at Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped raise Alloa after they fell into the third tier, and transformed St Mirren so that they did not fall into the top tier of the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I guess it's a bit of a crucial point," he said as he recalled taking the reins at Alloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the right career for me, more so than being a player.
It sounds odd because I did it right, I made a reasonable living from it, and I got a few highlights.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do weekly.
I'm still going through that in terms of stress and work pressures but management feels fine.
I always wanted to be a manager and as I have realised that, I now feel more satisfied with my world than ever before."

The perfect time for a pint is 5.30 on a Saturday night, according to a survey.
The hot summer weather has boosted the earnings of Britain's struggling pubs, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bar and pub groups saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July - but there was a 4.8 per cent decrease in restaurant earnings, according to figures.
Peter Martin from EWC business consultancy who collected the figures said: "Because the hot weather has continued, and England have stayed in the World Cup longer than expected, a pattern quite similar to June, where pubs saw an increase of 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants suffered even more.
After the 1.8 per cent drop in the restaurant trade in June, things went from bad to worse in July.
Pubs and bars that sold best-performed drinks saw more progress than restaurants saw from a loss.
Pubs focused on selling food also suffered because of the sun, although not as much as people running restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across the pubs and bars under management, there was a 6.6 per cent increase in drinks sales for the month, while there was a three per cent decrease in food."
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and hospitality analysis company, said: "These results show a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors in sales in the market outside the home.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups are still suffering, although a 4.8 per cent year-on-year reduction is bound to be painful in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for people running restaurants focused on selling food, and time will show whether the more moderate August temperatures will give us some much-needed respite."
In July, sales in pubs and restaurants increased by 2.7 per cent, including new ones opened. This reflected the slowdown in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the pubs and restaurants sector in the UK collects and analyses performance data from 47 action groups. They have a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and are the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have hidden social media accounts that they keep from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have hidden social media accounts they keep from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
An overview of 20,000 high school students showed that there was an increase in "Insta fake" pages.
The news has heightened the concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a "major" account to show to parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils has shown a rapid increase in "False Insta" accounts - which refers to Instagram's photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened the concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted.
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a "best" fit account to show to parents, while they also had private ones.
One mother came across her 13-year-old daughter's hidden site and saw a teenager encouraging others to " rape me."
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headteachers' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers can't find."
Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on Scotland's athletics board.
At the governing body's annual general meeting, Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be on the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from the wide range of experiences she has had at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected across the Scottish athletics community, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from having it on the table," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am keen to be a voice for athletes and hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics on top of the four other Olympic gold medals he has, and is now a regular pundit on the BBC, but was unable to walk after suffering a temporary ischemia.
He wrote on Twitter: "I'm back today.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was time to show if I will get better or to what extent I will get better.
It's been a killer but I've completely recovered, learned how to walk again and today I'm doing some agility exercises!
Thank you for all the messages of encouragement!"
There is an online variety of opinions about a pump advertisement that compares mothers with cows.
An online variety of opinions in the wake of an advert from an almost pump company that compares feeding mothers with cows are milked.
To mark the launch of the world's first wearable "near-silent pump," tech goods company Elvie has released a teaser ad in the form of a music video to show the freedom the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
There are four real mothers dancing in a haystack and cows in it, to a track that contains words like: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice, these are not purses, but breasts."
The chorus goes on: "Pumping out, pumping out, I'm feeding the babies, pumping out, pumping out, I'm milking the bud."
However, the announcement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has been a hot topic online.
With 77,000 people watching the video and hundreds commenting, it has received a mixed response from viewers, with some saying it doesn't convey the milk industry's "superiority" in any way.
"A very poor decision when using cattle to advertise this product."
Like us they need to conceive and give birth in order to produce milk, but their baby is stolen from them within days of giving birth," wrote one.

Another said: "It is understandable that this is traumatic for the mother and the baby.
"Why don't they use it to keep track of their children's progress?"
Another added: "An advertisement that doesn't understand the current world."
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she saw the song as "extremely odd."
"This is a great idea.
I would have had one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
It's a bit of a misnomer, but I took it for what it was.
This is a great product," wrote one
Another said: "This is a fun-filled ad aimed at mums who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like a "cautious."
It's not enough to praise or criticize the advertising industry."
At the end of the video the group of girls reveal that they have been dancing with the pumps hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who pump from the breast feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits nicely inside a nursing bra. This gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother said: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
In showing similarities between breastfeeding and dairying we wanted to highlight breastfeeding and all its challenges, demonstrating the incredible freedom that comes from the new pump in an entertaining and relevant way.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has reached the front pages.
During London Fashion Week, a mother-of-two appeared on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children being kept from fleeing has increased sharply although the numbers crossing the border every month have not changed much. This is in part due to strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration making it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been migrants themselves with no right to be in the country, and have worried about risking their right to remain in the country while stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective patrons and other adults in the house would be required to provide fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
"Nearly 80 per cent of individuals who are patrons or members of the same household as patrons, live in the country illegally, and many of those are foreign criminals.
So we continue to go after those individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was previously normal, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear via a video-conferencing call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status in front of an immigration judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for assistance will be sent out of the country without delay.
According to asylum workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed. This can lead to violent pulses or an attempt to escape.
Advocates say such concerns are worse in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering can be ignored, due to its size.
It was added that moving children to the city tents without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma many are battling.
Syria told ‘vessels have occupied' from the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, pretend to fight terrorism, and will "deal with them appropriately."
"They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more than millions having been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have had a clean-up of all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces from Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers fighting the war-torn country.
Discussing refugees, Moualem said the circumstances were right for them to return, and blamed "some western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that encouraged refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the process for them to return," he said.
"They've made it a political issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last stronghold of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to press ahead with political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped to avoid a major Russian-backed Syrian attack on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "definite time limits" and expressed hope that military action targeting jihadists would include fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who will be "destroyed."
With this, Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy hopes to call the first meetings of a new committee made up of government members and opponents to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government to get involved in the committee, saying that the panel's work will be to "review the existing articles of the constitution," and warned them from interfering.
Why Trump Won't Win a Second Term
Given that, Mr. Trump could be re-elected in 2020 if not, as many liberals hope he will be, that impeachment and scandal will soon put an end to his presidency.
And that would be, without a doubt, the "most dramatic ending to a presidency ever!"
Currently, there are no signs that the watchers are tired.
Since 2014, peak hour figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million viewers peak hours, which has increased from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" program has surpassed the cable TV viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a text that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, the program runner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," quoting a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She recalled a trip in a taxi in Boston prior to the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because it made me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There's entertainment in the middle of the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether families who have immigrated can be brought back together, and the state of the global economy.
Only the most privileged viewers have the ability to turn off the TV.
And yet, it goes further than being an informed citizen when you realize you're on the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts argue about Bob Woodward's use of the words "intensive background" as he tracks information for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 short ostrich skin jacket ("a garment with too much pride," according to the Washington Post) and the implications of Trump's terrifying descriptions of Stormy Daniels.
I don't think I'll ever be able to watch Super Mario ever again.
"Part of what makes you feel like it's like a reality program is that it feeds you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about Trump's program characters being rotated and the daily twist in the tail of the stories (fighting with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one chapter or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern beach of Kauai, but he had swatted inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not leave the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh not set to face the Judicial Committee of Parliament and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programmes a long time ago and people saying, 'This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,' Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but the truth is they were right."

Money from outside flowing into the mid-term election races in the House
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives a stream of money, thanks to a reform of congressional districts meaning that two electors are in the race for the same seat.
Pittsburg's recently redrawn suburban district is in favour of Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a spring special election last year.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which overlaps significantly with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unfairly unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has ignited a campaign finance battle between the finance branches of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a contest that gained much attention in March in a special election to Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
A Republican had held the seat for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
The Liberals say the Democrats are on the front line.
U.S. considering punishing El Salvador for providing support to China, then withdrawing
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without much of an unfavorable response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heated meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Banama in June 2017. He had a hotel in Banama until partners turned out the Trump Foundation management team.
State Department officials decided to call back heads of diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decisions to refuse to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesperson for the department, in a statement earlier this month.
El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in aid from America in 2017, was given sanctions that included drug control, economic aid, and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country in Central America and its high rate of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings moved forward, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials explained that they wanted the conference to go ahead, and thus put an end to any consideration of punishing El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence was earmarked to address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting.
And the three American messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any difficult new messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson of the White House on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to give details of the issue that were described by the three American officials, which included two diplomats who agreed to talk about the internal discussions on condition that they were unknown.
The reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition that he was of unknown.
The History of Wales
The next major event may be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on the possibility that Mr. Trump has obstructed justice, where there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller also mentioned in his report whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to face liability to that body, as he prepares to go before voters once again, and perhaps a jury of his peers in the long and long run.
There's a lot of uncertainty surrounding that, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - or his European counterparts.
There are choices that need to be made by all of us on either side of the Atlantic that will have an impact throughout the efforts.
In 1938 German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if the west had only resisted it and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We missed the opportunity, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of stalemate that had taken place.
The course of history revolves around such points of inflection, and the relentless journey of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these inflection points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who manages the fortunes of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep waters ever since this paper reported last year, that he suggested secretly recording the president and theorizing that he was unsuitable for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times report is wrong.
"How will we respond if the investigation that the F.B.I has just asked Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite allegations of credible sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
In other words, are we going to have to wait until the next election to elect Mr. Trump?
If we fail those tests, it will be difficult on democracy.
But I don't think we'll be able to do that, because of the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that was once occupying my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table that would show the swastika.
And that's part of my heritage, how can I not be hopeful for the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers before playing against Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians, following the Spanish draw against Villarreal earlier this month, will mean they are well placed to qualify from the European League G Group.
A knee injury meant Graham Dorrans was unable to play this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result to achieve great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
We started the game thinking that we could get something and we came away with a point.
We could have won in the end but, on the whole, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
As for Thursday night, it's another big European night.
We hope we can get three points but that will be difficult because they got a good result in their final game. But, with the crowd supporting us, I'm sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely challenging, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made at the club itself, but there's a nice feeling in the place now.
The trailer is good and the boys enjoy it awfully; the exercises are good.
Hopefully we can keep going now, forgetting about last season and succeeding."
Women are losing sleep because of this fear of retirement savings.
Despite those who took part in the survey having a good idea of how they wanted to be looked after, only a few people spoke about it to family members.
About half of the individuals in Nationwide's study said they spoke to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they spoke to their children about that.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they're not taking the steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't report your wishes well in advance.
Work with your adviser and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be important factors in determining the cost.
Include your financial adviser: Your adviser can help you think of a way to cover those costs as well.
Your options for funding long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid value-of-money life insurance policy to cover those costs or self-insure with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Build your legal documents: Prevent legal battles.
Make sure you have a healthcare proxy so that you appoint a person you trust to oversee your medical care to make sure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You should also take into account your financial situation.
You would choose someone you trust to make your financial decisions for you and to make sure your bills are paid if you can.
Don't forget the minor details: Imagine your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write those details in a written plan so that you're ready.
It's about more than financial issues, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
make that plan."
A MAN has been shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02.30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, with the number of deaths likely to rise.
With ties broken, rescue officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area in northern Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have had to migrate after the earthquake struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population estimate of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300km (180 miles) of coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The census, an administrative area under a province, had a population estimate of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Mining for nickel is also important in the state, but most of that work takes place in Morowali, on the coast of the other side of the island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Seismic Fire Zone and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that made landfall against the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya's record-breaking shallow earthquake struck Aceh, causing devastation and terror as people were reminded of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Lombok, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings leaving thousands of tourists stranded there temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disrupting domestic violence reporting and refusing the arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged offences, she took her phone off.
Palin is being held in custody at Mat-Su Correctional Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked about his whereabouts, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanor charges, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with Class B misbehaviour, which carries a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Appeals.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, breach of reporting of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he had given her a punch in her face.
Sarah Pilan was criticised by veterans' groups in 2016 after linking her son's threatening behaviour to PTSD arising from his time serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, which is north-east of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos are shared on social media showing the time of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors call for the death penalty for the man suspected of carrying out the terror attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare penalty that has not been imposed in the state for a federal offense since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented truck from Home Depot to attack a bike path along the West Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting the pedestrians and cyclists who were on their way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight individuals and caused "intentionally" serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which is filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these cases can result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury convicted Saipov with a 22-year-old indictment that included eight counts of murder for cheating, charges that are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a conviction of violence and destruction to motor vehicles.
The prosecutors said that the attack required "substantial planning and planning", describing Saipov's attack as "fierce, cruel and corrupt."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the warning said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York introduced the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was immediately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both of them were put to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who hails from Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to have an ISIS flag in his room at the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defendants representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of release makes only an extension of the trauma of these events to all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had already asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says NIGEL Farage should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘act on the voice of the people' today during a protest at the Tory convention.
The former leader of UKIP said politicians must ‘feel the pressure' from Euroskeptic members - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
At the march in Birmingham, Peter Bone, one of the Conservative members of the backbenches, said the UK would have ‘got out' by now if Mr Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May is facing in reconciling her highly divided ranks based on Remain-supporting Tories is joining another Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to keep up with her Chequers scheme amid attacks from pro-Brexit, pro-Remain and European Union supporters.
Allies have insisted that she will still try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - forcing Euroskeptic and Labour members to choose between her pack and ‘rare'.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to ‘take Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made lord and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
‘If it had been responsible, we would have gone out by now,' he said.
MP Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand in favour of Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers.'
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We did not fight in world wars to be secondary.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that indicated that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is absolutely wrong.'
Andrea Jenkyns, a pro-Brexit Tory member, was also at the march and told reporters: ‘I say: First Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are not popular among the public, the Opposition is not going to vote in favour of the scheme, it is unpopular among our party and active members who walk the streets in order to elect us in the first place.
Don't just sit back and listen."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: ‘Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must ‘feel the pressure' if they wanted to frustrate the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
‘Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
‘They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them ‘we won't let you do that'.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, who are about to betray Brexit, feel that pressure.
'We are acting on the voice of the people of the country who delivered a Brexit victory for us and we will continue until we are an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, people who are in favour of Remain marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tory flags against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
One of the Labour lords, Lord Adoins, made fun of the Conservatives because of the safety issues they had with the party's app as the conference opened.
‘Rankings are the people who tell us they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for a Canada plus plus deal, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he said.
‘It's absolute farce.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren is serious about applying for the president's post
Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senator says she will "look closely at applying to be president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe says that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a state Representative for the GOP, who co-chaired Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There's been a lot of speculation about her being able to compete against Trump in 2020.
At the event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, she was meeting with constituents for the 36th time using the town hall format since Trump took office.
Someone who was present asked if she intended to stand for the president's position.
Warren said it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrested after Sims of LSU was shot to death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that someone had been arrested on suspicion of shooting Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference at 11am.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man featured in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the University of the South campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died instantly as a result," Murphy J. Paul, a top police officer, told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in in order to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and he admitted to being at the site, possessing a weapon, and he admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without investigation and remanded in custody in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a 6 foot 6 inch and 6 foot young boy who grew up in Baton Rouge. He had played in 32 games starting 10 of them last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world title after the team's routine helped him take the lead over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear after Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' "team order" would play a major part in the race.
From the post, Bottas got a good start and nearly left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went to the first pit stop leaving Hamilton to reach the traffic at the end of the pack, something that should have been fate.
The Mercedes later went to the lap pole by coming out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after coming to himself which saw the Ferrari driver, inexperienced, leave the inside free in danger of catching up to go after a double move to defence on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he held on in his tyres to try and finish quickly and passed Kimi Raikkonen to secure fourth place.
He finally came to the poles on lap 44 but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen came to fourth position.
It's a tough day because Valtteri has done great all weekend and he was a gentleman letting me pass.
The team has done a great job to get one two," said Hamilton.
That's a very poor body language
U.S. President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted she did not share the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
As he spoke at a rally in Northern Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the evidence that Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead he said that what goes on in Parliament shows that people are "hateful and evil and liars."
The one thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the last few days in Parliament, when you see the anger, when you see people who are hateful and evil and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and the documents that are shared and then they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
I did not do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you share the letter?
Remember when you said, "Oh my God, what the heck?"
Oh, no he didn't.
I didn't share the document."
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't do it, we didn't do it," he added, mocking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was shared early in September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had been shared by a member of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't share his story," Feinstein told the committee.
She asked me to keep the letter confidential and I did that as she had asked."
But the president didn't seem to believe her, and made a comment during the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, her body language was very poor.
She may not have done it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested the Democrats were using the allegations to their own ends.
"They are determined to take back the power by any means necessary.
You see the hatred, the malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample on to get power and control," the president said according to Meditate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made it right for a loss in the Elite League on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the game back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won the front early as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to level the home team's score before Dwyer restored the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard levelled the score for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
This is the third time Adam Keefe's men have lost in the Elite League this season, a team that had unexpectedly beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth time the teams met this season, with the Giants beating the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening try came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping as Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped provide Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead in the first intermission as he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and, once again, Bouchard made sure they had an equal score with a powerful try at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game late in the second period and secured the victory by scoring his team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds Can Escape from Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is called a hero after he dies making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people lifts off the ground safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still hitting the area and many are stuck in rubble in the city of Palu.
But while his colleagues fled for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old boy, refused to leave his job at the highly-studied control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained there to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to lift off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling.
He later died at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirait said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia said.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Hearing the news is heartbreaking," he said.
Meanwhile, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the disaster relief agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number is probably still rising because there are many bodies still under the debris and many bodies that we have not yet reached," said a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A wave that reached six metres has disrupted Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance brings bodies here every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing from the little supermarkets everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
The situation is already catastrophic, but it could get much worse."
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the movement and transportation.
"Are you ready?" asked CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that caused 550 deaths.
A plane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline that flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after saying the 47 passengers and crew all managed to leave the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not seen one man who was travelling on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials say seven people were transported to a hospital Friday.
The airline said six people were still in hospital on Saturday, all of whom are in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident and how exactly it happened.
The airline and the United States Navy have said that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane had gone over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane had flown in very low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other people had been able to walk through water to their centre to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He said that the plane's staff were upset and shouted, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors were working to improve nearby quays and had helped save people by using a windboat to transport people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aircraft Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in PNG registered aircraft crashes in the last two decades but none of those included Air Niugini.
A firefighter was on duty the night of the fire that burned down the
The prosecution presented its case on Saturday re-trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as a expert witness in the field of information analysis.
She outlined to the jury how she used mobile phone records to create a full picture of the movements of 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had location data from many mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting her previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers' mobile phone during the time he had said it was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday saying he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "telling a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misconstrued was that Tellis had said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted text messages, calls and Chambers' contact information from her phone some time after she died.
"It wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its deliberations on Wednesday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots, which are political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to return to those roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a new wave of support in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nani from New York sued a couple for their dismissal following a "racist" text message.
A New York nanny is prosecuting a couple for discriminating against her and dismissing her after she received a misdirected text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies being racist, saying the situation is as if someone is "trying to benefit."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she saw that childcare provider Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "disturbing", dismissed Ms. Maurice, saying that their old nanny, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and that she rather expected Filipinos, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice is prosecuting the couple for damages because of her dismissal, and she is seeking damages of $350 a day for the six-month work with accommodation she had been employed to do initially, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing things like that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple have criticised the claims that they were racist, saying that ending Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, as they were worried that they could not trust her after depriving her.
"My wife sent me something she didn't think she would say.
She's not sensible.
We're not racists," said Mr. Joel Plasco.
"But would you put your children in the care of someone you've been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I do not think."
Comparing the lawsuit to "a situation of someone trying to benefit", Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two weeks’ time and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to kill someone like that?
That's not a very nice thing to do," said the investment banker.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, it wasn't long before a public court condemned the couple on social media, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to step into the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
Now, it's very entertaining to know what we know about Paddington's huge success."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a toy bear, would have accepted it if his work had been rejected, but added that celebrating the 60th anniversary of the books' publication felt "a bitter sweet turn of events" after his death last year.
She said that her father was proud of Paddington's subsequent success quietly, describing the bear as "a very important member of the family".
"He was a very quiet man, and he wasn't a proud man," she said.
"But because Paddington is so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who does something: you're proud of the child even though you're not really responsible for his success.
I think he's looking at Paddington's success in that way.
Although the work was his creation and his imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Loius Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked tirelessly to save her life.
"He didn't call regularly to say that things were very bad, and he wasn't expected to come through," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Not saying she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, love.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs she had been given by the doctors to keep her heart beat were starting to end and leaving her system.
She had died before and now everything was shut down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't sing or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to have courage."
Soon and late Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, got on the plane alongside the other passengers - who were unaware of her bereavement.
"Nobody knew," he said.
I kept my head down, and the tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt the overwhelming sense of sympathy towards No.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent others from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Davis's son, was 13 when he became depressed and killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef and had an infectious smile.
They all remembered his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
However, he gave up his work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always concerned that that's going to have an impact again then."
Ms Davis put together the cards, "to let people know there are people you can go to and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit in silence, speak up."
Ms Humphreys has been friends with Ms Davis for years, and she lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after he lost his mother.
"He didn't say he was feeling sad or depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He had reached the bottom one Christmas Day - when the children were opening their presents he didn't do any eye contact with them or anything like that."
He said his death had been a huge shock to them, but they had to get through it: "It's tearing a hole through my family.
It's breaking us apart.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future at stake as the FBI begins to investigate
"I thought, if we could get something as it was being asked for - a time-limited, scope-limited investigation - maybe we could secure some unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling" amid a motionless partisan legislative stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their insecurities are a result of greed.
There are only five weeks to go until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of Parliament, which would enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to reach a decision and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean refugees ‘disappeared' under Kim's leadership
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has fallen since Jim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the Southern merger administration, said there were 1,127 flight incidents last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the stricter processes to control borders between North Korea and China and the higher rates that people smugglers are raising, were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most people who flee from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 people from North Korea had illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is a country easier to cross than the highly protected Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China refers to those fleeing as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and she often forces them back to their own country.
The relationship between North and South Wales - which is technically still at war - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the denuclearisation talks that had come to a halt.
This came following the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had a brief discussion about working towards nuclear removal in the Korean peninsula.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, on Saturday, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since.
"Without trust in the USA, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first of all," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "irresponsible", saying he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader of the House, called Brett Kavanaugh "irregular" and said it was not appropriate, due to the nature of his character, to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribulation Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had behaved like that, I'm sure they would have called her "irresponsible," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of Parliament's Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional in denying the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost crying and choking at times when discussing his family and his time in high school.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying the allegations against him "destroy his reputation in a coherent and monstrous way" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he could not serve in the Supreme Court because his evidence shows he was biased against Democrats.
"I think it shows he's unqualified with those statements and the way he accused Clinton's supporters and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to be confirmed, and if the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not suitable to be in the Supreme Court or to be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi said she as a Democrat was worried about Kavanaugh's possible cases against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Isn't this the time to have someone irresponsible and prejudiced in court waiting for us to say, ‘is that great?'," Pelosi said.
Women need to talk about it.
It's a righteous conversation, months and years of rage build up, and he can't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was somewhere executive, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique and so, when she gets angry and starts crying, she will say to the person who is talking to her, 'You think my goal is sad because I'm crying.
I'm in pain.'
And then she'll carry on.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed to give expression to anger partly because they are, basically, misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of an early job, in an office where men were the most, and I was crying out with anger beyond words, is an older woman holding me by the neck - a cold manager who was always frightening me - and dragged me into the stairwell.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-wedlock affair on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was very frustrated, realized that there was no reason she shouldn't think about applying for the president's job herself.
"I didn't think it was going to be easy," she said, laughing at me for the last 30 years.
"There were seven other candidates in the race already, and the last thing we needed was another.
We were called "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because she was late in the campaign, she was behind in fundraising, so she promised that she would not take part in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a vain battle.
She noticed that some of her fans who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, her feelings became too much for her - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that was making it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than representatives, and anger at the gender prejudice - and she started to cry.
"You'd think my nerves were broken," Ms. Schroeder said of the way the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I'm wondering, what will they put on my gravestone?
"She was crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can be in favour of Beijing
The first wave of the trade war between the US and China was enough to deafen someone, and while the battle is not over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by imposing taxes on China's key exports including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
The most significant increase was introduced this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the USA from China.
Beijing has always paid the helm and, most recently, it has imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on $600 billion of American goods.
China has promised to match US efforts and the world's largest economy is only one likely to surrender soon.
Getting Washington to give up means giving up on the demands, but publicly emigrating to the U.S. would raise far too much shame on China's president Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing can get around it properly, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could support China in a positive way in the longer term by ensuring that the two economies depend less on each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that trigger economic panic in either country is, in fact, far more dangerous than viewers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, an Asian-focused associate researcher at the New American Security Center, which is a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for the return of asylum seekers, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to accept asylum seekers back on a voluntary basis and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country that has been shattered by seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure, thanks to the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is working hard to renovate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
The conditions are now right for receiving asylum seekers back to the country after having to flee terrorism and the damaging economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still need humanitarian assistance in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.

Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup beating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The USA have lost six consecutive times on European soil, and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe managed to secure a victory as the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the required 14.5 points to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had had a difficult tournament, but when the star ball from the U.S. landed in the water on the 16th par-3 hole he had to surrender the match to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the golfer from Italy, had shone in every round, becoming 1 of the 4 players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was upset 5&4 by the weakest player on paper in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-scoring selection, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Ian Poulter of England who was probably playing in his last Ryder Cup.
Playing in his eighth Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful players in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I'm not usually one to cry, but I can't help that today.
She has had a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for putting his faith in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that we got the cup back.
It's the team that matters, and I'm glad I've been able to help," Garcia said through his tears after Europe won.
The baton passed to fellow countryman John Ram who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the match to the singles on Sunday.
"I was so proud to beat Tiger Woods as I had grown up watching him play golf," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all of his four matches in France, meaning that his record now in the Ryder Cup was 13-21-3.
And that's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players ever as he has won 14 championships in his career, second behind Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, Team USA had trouble through the weekend to find the clear road.
USA captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of this guy, they fought hard.
We had been to Europe in the morning.
we have fought.
You have to give credit to Thomas.
He is an undisputed captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We will fight back. I want to work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup Committee. We have to move on.
I love our 12 players and am proud to be their captain.
You've got to get your head around them.
"They played better than us."
