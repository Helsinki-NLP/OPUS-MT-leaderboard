Bennozh, yukina.
Have you got a car?
You've already been Paris?
How did you get a piece of money?

Laiding at least a good place - you're a lot of money.
That's a lot of fruit.
There are loads of major sections inside the Brazil.

I want to be a pint.
This thing Tom wanted to be done.
You did?
You know, are you?

She's reading it.
I'm gonna stay here.
I hope that.
He was a poor man.
He was staring at him.
He was a fat dog.
He was a poor man.
He was a very poor man.
He was a slave in vuh√©.
I've got to carry it on.
I'm an artist.
I'm an evaluator.
She's in the toilets.
That's Tokyo.
We need one thing.
They need friends.
And I'm gonna die with Getter Jaani.
Call the policy.
Who was it who spent all the gookies?
Tom could sit down if he wanted to do the police.
The car's locked.
Are you always a flower?
It's my heart.
It's all right.
It's gonna be all right.
I'm not waiting, sir.
I've got some questions you've just got.
I knew it was you.
I know you know.
I know that he says you can't tell me.
Are you jealous?
I saw him running.
I've seen Tom there.
You better go, don't you?
I'm better off.
I'd die better for being on the road without a long time.
There's something wrong with me.
The priest's white.
Is this white?
He was like a woman.
Can you just get the SIDA shit out of the toilets?
- What's up with you?
Did I get a little bread up for a long time?
How did Tom get?
What about Tom?
And you're serious?
And you very much?
Then Tom was here to come and see him?
He's not my cat. If one's white his feet
I'm so glad you're a good luck.
I think you're a good heart.
This isn't one of you.
Are you jealous?
Is it hot enough?
Many people were in the battle.
I've got many laughs.
She couldn't see Tom.
There was a song.
I love her.

You've taken everything.
I'll continue.
No, thank you.
I'm sick.
I'll try to make it easier.
I can see him out of here.
The house is beautiful.
I lost my pen.
I know I'm lost, sir.
They lost it again.

If the pen's lost.
If I don't know if I'm lost.
All right?
I'm gonna work alone.
If you've started this sheet, please let me know.

Me, I don't need anything.
You know it was.
I know you know.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Mersi, yukina.
They're dead.
I'm trying to get that to do with the English people.
Too many are there for us.
I'm sure we're going to tell you something.
- You're annoying officer.
Misleading.
They're gonna be invisible.
They're gonna go.
I'm going to go before the afternoon of the corner.
I go to school every day.
More coffee, please.
Well, it's OWW. It's so funny.
NAF, it's so cute.
NAF!
NAF, it's all right.
Hey, Hoob. What?
Don't speak to me!
Don't let me down.
I don't forget.
I haven't taken no touch.
I didn't take a shower.
I didn't listen.
I don't let you down.
Well, it's a big deal.
I don't like this.
You can't eat.
It can't be.
I don't expect it.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not saying that.
I didn't mean to be a composer like his father.
I didn't mean to go in his dad's directions.
I'm not talking to Japanese.
I'm not talking to Spanish.
I don't do anything.
She's not home.
I don't have any type.
I didn't sleep.
She was like a girl.
He didn't write the letter yet.
He was not by me.
There was no error.
It wasn't that mount, wasn't it?
I didn't sleep.
I don't have one.
I didn't listen.
I don't.
It's not too big to the house.
It's not too big to the house.
It's not white.
That's wrong.
Tom is not a director, this is not a teacher.
I don't know.
Mary can't tell them, I could'm talking.
I'm not going to die, you're already dead.
There is nothing going on with this shit.
There isn't any need for an instance.
I'm not getting home any more often and it's my head.
They didn't run.
I'm not being funny, is it?
I'm not feeling any more.
I don't know.
Good night!
Tom was talking about him.
Right, that's the wrong thing I've got to do with it.
They die.
He's all right.
He's such a little retarded.
He was such a loser.
He's such a prick.
He was a very poor man.
Thank you for Paris.
What kind of step do you want to play?
How much is this clock?
What's this truth?
How much is it?
How about this clock?
When did you take him?
Where are you talking to French?
Where's this problem?

She started Tom.
Press me.
Tom was a priest.
I should go.
Give me the plan?
It's too far for the food.
Please reply.
I've got to finish with my problems
I was too sorry.
Please give me the sheet.
Game sex with Tom.
It's like he was talking about Tom.
Oh, look, you gotta.
Look, a situation of an abelia.
Look, I like I'm a Japanese man!
Oh, look at you, mate.
Look, a second party.

The sound is not a phrase.
Shut up.
For this is he from us, he knows what he does in every country.
Think about it.
I remember this thing.
I thought Tom's dead.
I'm sure you'd have done something like this once.
I'm sure it was.
Are you sure?
I just took it by.
There's always a thing wrong with you. There's something wrong with it?
I think I know it's like I'm like she doesn't know what I'm doing.
Tom and the brew.
I mean, Tom.
I wanted you to know that.
Tom is game rugby.
Tom got shot.
I can see you in there.
I mean, I was talking to him.
Tom was still talking about having sex.
Tom would be safare.
I'm the only person who knows what happened in reality.
Tom is dressed with a ground that is large enough to keep it
Tom got to be a good man.
It's hot today.
It's hot.
Tom did not believe Mary when she told her she loved him.
There was no experience between Mary and John.
I can't see him.
What's the plan?
I want you to know what I'm doing!
Got a long time from the end of this century.
They're fucked.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks!
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
Thanks, Yukina.
Some people go home.
We need one.
I've seen something.
Have you seen a great shot?
It's a best project.
Like a coffee, as a plane.
It's a bike, please!
You got a car?
She has a dog.
It's a song.
A bullet needed.
She was a hard girl.
There's a filter played.
I was in there for a crowd of people. I knew there.
There is only one language.
I've been working with one another.
My book is on your desktop.
I'm all right.
