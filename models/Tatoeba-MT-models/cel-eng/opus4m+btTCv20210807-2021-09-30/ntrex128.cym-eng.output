ACau Cymru are worried that they will ‘really look’
Some ACs are worried about a proposal to change their titles in English to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of Parliament Cymru in Welsh).
This brings together plans to change the name of the assembly in Parliament.
ACs across the political spectrum are worried that this could be the text of a weed.
AC from the Labour party said that its group was worried because the title was —obvious with the words Twp and Pup. ·
And to anyone who understands the Greek: You don't want to be called names so.
AC from Plaid Cymru said that the group at all was —unhappy — with the suggestion and that they had offered other options.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group maintained an open-ended succinct, regarding the change of name, but it was suggested that there is not much verbal difference between MWP and succinct succinct succinct succinct succinct succinct succinct squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt s
The ASC translation does not pose as much trouble.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change in name: —Of course, a matter to the members themselves will be the final decision on any descriptions to the titles of Assembly Members. ·
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on the proposals. Global support was seen to call the assembly in Parliament Cymru.
As to the title of Assembly Members, the Commission favoured Members of Parliament for Wales (ASC) / Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), but MWP came out strongest in the public consultation.
According to the statement, ACs suggests other options, but the work of coming to consensus could cause the President, Elin Jones. She is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes in weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the plan works, including rules on ACs intervention and the design of the committee system.
The ACs will have the final debate as to what they should be called as they discuss the legislation.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday as to whether the country's name should be changed to —North Macedonia's Republic of Macedonia.
This popular vote was drawn in an attempt to resolve a conflict that has lasted decades with Greece, a neighbouring country that has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has since claimed that the name of its northern neighbors represents a right to its territory. She has opposed the country’s requests to become a member of the EU and NATO drones.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, opposes the country's vote on name change and has said that he will dismiss the vote.
However, those of the regime's party, including the Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, argue that a name change is the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St Martin’s Clychau Tewi as Churches in Harlem Faced Problems
- Historically, there was a bar and a church on each corner, according to the old people I have spoken to them, - Mr. Adams said.
Today, one of them is. —
He said that he could understand why the bars have disappeared.
- People socialize in a different way today - he said.
By this time bars are not considered community living rooms where people go regularly.
As for churches, it is worrying that the money obtained by selling assets will not last as long as the leaders expect it to do, —and as long and late as, they will be back in the same old situation.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by flats with condominia full of the kind of people who will not help the rest of the area's shrines.
·The local majority of the people who buy condominia in these buildings will be white, - he said, —which will mean that all these churches will close sooner because it is unlikely that most of these people who move to these condominia will become members of the churches. ·
The two churches were built by white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - The Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congress moved from there in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been worshipping nearby became owned by the building.
St. Martin's church was transferred to a black conglomerate under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a phoicot of the retailers on Street 125, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, which refused to employ than tyre black people.
The building was severely damaged in fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's portfolio made plans for reconstruction, the bells were commissioned.
The Rev David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor at St. Martin's church, was pleased to give the name — the boxes of the poor - upon them.
The expert who sang the clogs in July gave them another name: —Third cultural treasure — and a unique historical offering. ·
Also, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noted that these were the first bells in the world to be sung by a black musician, Dionising A. Lind, who moved to sing the larger bells at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's church was not in place.
What has happened in St. Martin's church during the last few months has been a complex history of chiefs and contractors, some of whom have been employed by church lay leaders, and some others by the embassy.
The mayor - the governing body of the plethora consisting of lay leaders - wrote to the embassy in July to indicate concerns that the embassy would be —try to transfer the costs - to the mayor, although the mayor had not been associated with the employment of the architects and contractors in whom the embassy had been sent there.
Some plethora complained that there was a lack of transparency on the part of the embassy.
Shark injured 13-year-old boy as he bluffed to look for gymnasts in California
According to official employees, a truck attacked a 13-year-old child and injured it on Saturday while he was plumbing to search for gymnasts in California, and that's on the first day of the charity's season.
The attack occurred just before 7am near Beacon beach at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been plumbing with his friends for about half an hour Saturday when he heard the boy shouting for help. Then he swimd to him with a group to help remove him from the water.
Hammel said that he believed he had excited when holding a chemical was the boy to start. But, after reaching the boy, Hammel said to him —to remind him that he was shouting, ‘I've been hurt!
I've been hurt!'
The bridge of his shoulder had been torn open--
I shouted at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There's a shark in the water-- Hammel said.
The boy was raised from the water in a helicopter and transported to the American Plant Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in serious condition.
We don't know which species of sharks were responsible for the attack.
In a brief to the media, lifesaver, Captain Larry Giles, said that Shark had been seen in the area some weeks earlier, but that she was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles said the victim had harmful injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the Swami beach in Ecinitas. That was done for 48 hours for safety and investigation purposes.
Giles said that there are more than 135 shark species in the area but that most of them are not considered dangerous ones.
Sainsbury's plans to reach UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty seconds in the form of departmental stores consisting of specialist assistants.
As part of the effort to reach the UK’s beauty market, a £2.8bn market that still grows although fashion sales and goods to the home will drop, these larger beauty seconds will be spent in 11 stores across the country. They will be put in more shops next year if they are successful.
This investment comes in the world of beauty as supermarkets search for ways of using empty shelves after being challenged for television sets, microwaves and goods to the home.
Sainsbury's said he would double the number of his beauty products by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Goods by L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space and the branded areas will be similar to those you would see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches its Boutique cosmetic collection so that most products are suitable for volunteers - something that more and more calls for among young shoppers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop's retailer will trial concessions at two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The fact that people shop online and move towards buying a few food every day at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that the outlets will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with the discounters Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since she bought both chains two years ago. It says that this has reinforced food sales and has ensured acquisitions are more profitable.
He did not make the previous effort of the architect to refurbish his beauty and pharmacy sections.
Sainsbury's offered a initiative in conjunction with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership ended following a fray about how to share the pharmacy's shopping revenue in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s, three years ago, sold his pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain. The business consisted of 281 stores and was sold for £125m.
Lloyds said that part of the plan would be as it would add an extended range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: —We have completely changed the look and sense of our beauty skill in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained co-workers and will be there to offer advice.
Our range of brands are designed to suit all needs and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an essential beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones sings after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, sang after television presenter Holly Willoughby, pulled out of a £11 million deal with his live-action brand business, and that's to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand of accessories and goods to the home.
The pair's business had been compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
Willoughby, one of the presenters of This Morning, had given a message on Instagram announcing that she was leaving.
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, sings after Holly Willoughby pulled out of their brand business a way of professional living on the last minute - to focus on his own major new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was —drained - on Tuesday when the presenter admitted at a meeting at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that she no longer had enough time for Truly, their brand of accessories and goods to the home.
The business had been compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and it was mentioned that he doubled Willoughby's fortune, an estimated £11 million.
As Willoughby, age 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: —Truly was one of Holly's main priorities.
That was her future in the long term and the work she would have done over the next few decades.
Everyone has been surprised at hearing that she has decided to leave.
Nobody could believe what was going on Tuesday, and she was so close to the launch.
There is a full warehouse of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, and those ready to be sold. -
Experts believe this decision by one of Britain’s most bankable stars could cost millions to the company due to a large investment in products, including cushions, candles, clothing and goods to the home. This could also mean more delays before launch.
This may also be the end on a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity presenter on ITV.
Night, a source who is friends with Jones said, “We would not comment on his business issues. ·
It was a difficult course ‘and then we fell in love'
He made fun of the top of the criticism that would be found by the media of the news about making a comment —analysediently, according to some, and because it was so positive when talking about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump surrendered so much?
Trump said by watwar news reporter.
—I didn't surrender anything.
He said that Kim wanted to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting that Trump described as a major step forward to denouncing North Korea.
But, the discussions on decontamination have slowed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, one of North Korea's leading diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not believe that U.S. is responding in line with North Korea's early decentralization movements.
Instead, he said that US continues to set sanctions that have the goal of supporting the pressure.
Trump was much more confident in his major speech.
- We're doing great with North Korea, - he said.
—We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship. -
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results - giving up testing rockets, helping to release gullies and making sure the rest of America's troops return home.
He went on to justify his unusual method of acting in terms of talking about the relationship with Kim.
—It is so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people standing outside trying to come into this full arena, we would have about 200 people standing here, - Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of it.
Tsunami and Indonesia Earthquake Destroying Island, by Hundreds
Following the earthquake at Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, national disaster was not declared, something necessary to catalyze international aid.
—I'm a lot of cases, unfortunately, they've explained that they don't ask for international assistance, so it's quite challenging, - Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children creates a team to travel to Palu, they are not sure yet whether foreign staff can work on the land.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman on behalf of the national agency for disasters, said that officials from Indonesia evaluated the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be given assistance.
Because the earth is constantly declining in Indonesia, the myth country is not ready enough for nature disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
It appears that a seiren was not warned about the tsunami in Palu, although a warning had been given, and that he had contributed to the number of deaths.
It is difficult to travel between the numerous Indonesian islands at best.
Natural disasters mean that the logistics is even more complex.
A hospital ship that had been hauled at Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's racial segregation in his election campaign and has spent a load of money on roads and railways.
But lack of money has been a freak on Mr. Joko's administration as he faces reelection next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from long-term nominal tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more liberal form in faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other unwarranted weapons.

I asked Kante to come and chiciais the ball without thinking too much about it, just go about it.
Half time, Chelsea won 1-0 after Eden Hazard, the star of Belgium, scored in the 25th minute.
The shooter from Chelsea's team passed the ball with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic that time, before turning away near the middle of the field and sprinkling into Liverpool's half.

Cromwell's statue outside of Parliament is the latest memorial to be part of the ‘refunding history' fray
Getting rid of the statue would be a bardic justice about the enmity destruction that caused to as many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, a destruction made by its Fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society said that Mr Crick's suggestion is a one-way one-of-a-kind-of-a-kind-and-a-half-a-half-a-half-a-half-a-half-a-half-a-half-year-old-of-year-old.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society said: —She was annoyed, in the current discussion about removing statues, that figure Oliver Cromell outside of the Westminster Balas would be targeted.
Cromwell was not responsible for carrying out or commanding the iconoclastism of England's civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century opinion and is part of a figure historian in which many people believe it is still worth its celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: —A number of people, more in the 19th century than possibly today, consider Cromwell a figure who did protect the rank from external pressure, which is the king in his case.
We don't know whether that's absolutely true or not and that's an ongoing historical discussion.
What is certain is that the resistance in the mid-17th century has navigated the development of our country after that and Cromwell is a single known figure representing one side of the issue.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worth their celebrations and memorials. -
Rheibus Pig Killing Farmer from China
A mosque attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
South China Morning Post said on Sunday that a man, who was known according to his surname ‘Yuan', had been found dead near a mosque tulk in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province. His artisans had broken and he was bloody over it.
A pig farmer was preparing to spray fractures on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to the statement, he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring state of Tunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 cheeks in the market.
The following morning. His cousin found him dead and noticed that the door of a nearby mosque tulk was open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the tulk and that there was blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-weight mosque had torn the firefighter to death, according to the report.
—My cousin's legs had been torn down and they were all bloody, - said the cousin, who was called by his surname, -Wu - according to a quote at the Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera video showed Yuan reaching the market for 4.40am on Thursday to feed his cheek.
His body was found about an hour later.
Neither Yuan nor his cousin were the victims of the animal that killed the man.
One of the market leaders told the Evening News that the mosque had been locked in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence on the site.
According to the mention, the Yuan family and market authorities discuss compensation for his death.
Although there are not many of them, there are other records of cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a mosque attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years later, a 650-year-old pig caught a fencer from Wales against his tractor until his wife rushed the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his cheek in 2012, one of Manitoba's farmers told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that bloody flavor can cause them to behave thus.
—They're being bitter.
They are young, very curious...they don't intend to hurt you.
You have to give them enough respect, - he said.
Resilience of Rosa coral causes heavy rain over a vast area of south-west US
According to the forecasts, the Rosa Crown weakens as it moves over the colder waters of the western coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa's hurricane will cause heavy rain across northern Mexico and southwestern US over the next few days.
Rosa had 85 mph winds, Chorus Category 1, from 5am on Eastern time on Sunday. The hurricane was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move about north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific and moves east towards the US's Western Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, the hurricane will begin to push a deep tropical humidity about the north to the south-west of the US.
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches in hand to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity will react with the trough approaching causing heavy rain over the southwest during the next few days.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of hand will cause a major dangerous flooding, a flow of rubble and possible disturbances in the wilderness.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates between 2 and 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected as much as between 2 and 4 inches in hand in parts of the southeast, especially over much of Arizona.
It is possible that large flooding with the conditions will worsen rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very annoying to venture out into the wilderness on foot with a threat of a tropical hand.
Heavy rain could cause the quake to become wild rivers and a storm of fall and rain will cause strong winds and blows of dust in the area.
The approaching trough will cause some local heavy hand in parts of the South California coast.
It is possible that a total of more than half an inch at hand will fall, which could cause a small stream of rubble and slipping roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the area during its wet season.
A few scattered tropical cyclones will begin to arrive in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spread more late Monday and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will last throughout Wednesday.
The temperatures will change dramatically throughout the US during October as the Arctic cools, but the collisions will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in the temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic changes in temperature through the middle of the US Sunday.
There are nearly 20 degrees of difference in temperatures between the City of Kansas, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, what's remaining of summer warmth will try to rise and expand again.
A large portion of central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start to October with the temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Valleys to parts of the North East.
The temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long term climate forecasts show a high chance at higher temperatures than the average for US east through the first half of October.
More than 20 million watching Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually abused her in the 1980s, gave evidence, and that on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political disagreement continued, with broadcasters applauding normal programs to deliver the unexpected turnout on Friday: an agreement drawn by the Arizona Senator, Jeff Flake, stating that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched in her allegedly and tried to pull her clothes away at a party at high school, and they had drunk.
Kavanaugh said in giving his evidence that he was absolutely sure that that did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people are likely to have watched it on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company accounted for average audience number on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And usually Nielsen has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.
In order to give perspective, the size of this audience was similar to an audience who would watch a football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, in which the channel's opinion hosts have given strong support to appoint Kavanaugh, who was leading all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million spectators, NBC had 2.94 spectators, NSNBC had 2.89 million spectators and CNN had 2.52 million spectators.
There was also much interest following the hearing.
Flake was the foremost figure in the play on Friday.
After the moderate Republicans' office declared that it would be a vote of Kavanaugh's party, he was held on CNN and CBS's cameras Friday morning with protesters shouting at him as he attempted to enter into a lift to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood looking about the floor for some minutes as he got a head full, alive on television on CNN.
“I stand here before you,” said one woman.
—Do you think it is telling the truth to the country?
It was said to him that, —you have the power and so many women are powerless. ·
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said that, before the lift closed, he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all filmed live hours later, when it came time for the Judicial Committee to vote to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination and get a vote in the full Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI would investigate the claims against the nominee by the following week, a result in which minority Democrats have been encouraging him.
Flake was partly convinced after chatting with his friend, the Democratic Senator, Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and many other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was a powerful one, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh.
British MP May accused critics of ‘play politics' in Brexit case

Police clash with Catalan separatists before celebrating a year since the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two protesters of independence parties clashed with the anti-terror police and as thousands joined competitive protests to mark a year since Catalonia's divided vote on discrimination.
A group of people in mystics who were from a party distinguished the blizzard of the anti-terrorist police who held them back with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would usually be an overland of tourists.
There were also resistances later during the day, with police using their batons to control the struggle.
Over the course of many hours, groups of independence parties were yelling —No forget, no forgivenesss — and unionist protestors yelled —A life for Spain.
14 people were treated for minor injuries they received in the protests, according to the local press.
The tensions are still high in this area which has its moment on independence, and that year after the October 1 referendum in which Madrid considered it illegal but which was celebrated by Catalans who are separatists.
The minority majority of voters chose to become independent, but many people did not come to vote and those who are against separation had significantly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the blast at police stations across the region in violent riots.
Groups of independence parties camped Friday night to prevent resistance from the national police party.
The resistance went ahead but was forced to follow another thread.
According to Narcis Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who was going to protest the separatists with his wife, was no longer confident about having independence to Catalonia.
—Last year, we had one of the best times ever.
I watched my parents crying by happiness when able to vote but we're recovering in the same old situation now, — he said.
Although they managed to have a small but vital victory in the regional elections in December last year, groups that are of independence party have found it difficult to keep the momentum to go this year and many of their most well-known leaders have either outlawed themselves or waited for a trial for helping organize the referendum and declare independence after that.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone to support the police, the politicians on both sides had been pursuing the waters during the collision.
The bad feeling is increasing, - he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before trial since the end of last year, announced that he would apply in the next year's European Parliament elections.
- Standing as a candidate for European elections is the best way of condemning the recession in democratic values and the blues we have seen by the government of Spain, - he said.

Menga's shot secures a 1-0 victory to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal over Livingston secures victory for Livingston
Livingston surprised the Rangers causing Steven Gerrard to lose for the second time in 18 games as Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's shot was the difference as Gary Holt's team rose to Hibernian level in a second.
Gerrard's team has not won a game from home in the Supreme Court this season and they face Hearts next Saturday, which is at the top and eight points ahead of them.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host a match against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has beaten six consecutive games in the division, and the main coach, Holt, has not lost a game since he traded Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have been on the front long before they scored and their direct nature caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but dragged his effort across the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could not but widely analyze his effort after slipping to meet Craig Halkett's head across the goal,
The home team was willing to let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing they could cause difficulties to the others in certain places.
And that's how the overall goal was achieved.
The Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston worked to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to help Menga, who kicked the ball and scored from the center of the box.
By then, the Rangers were controlling possession of the ball but there was no way they could break through the home team defenders and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, did not worry about sex much.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos oversaw a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected at the feet of Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Lithgow kicked the ball wide from another play set by Livingston.
Crossers came to Livingston's box continuously and they continued to be cleared, and had two rights to a penalty kick - after Halkett challenged the player's delegate, Glenn Middleton, and one for a hand ball - disbanded.
‘A wonderful performance' by Livingston -
Alasdair Lamont, one of BBC Scotland's analysts at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A wonderful performance and outcome for Livingston.
They were great and they continued to raise the expectations on this path that escalated.
The style of their play and personnel have not changed greatly since they reached the top, but Holt must be praised for the way he has motivated the team since he arrived.
He had as many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, organizing an extremely organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrill on the fronts of their feet through the game.
But the Rangers had no much inspiration.
Although they had played well at times under Gerrard's control, the standards of those were not to be seen.
They had a great deal of tackle on their last ball - only once they opened the home side - and were a bit of a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
A mixed welcome to Erdogan at Cologne
She was a blue sky and everyone smiled on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
She is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - a visit to try to improve the ties between NATO presidents.
They have disagreed over issues including human rights, freedom in the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police had given security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from engaging in front of the mosque, but enough supporters had come beside the mosque to see their scene.
Hundreds of protesters who were against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - made sure their voices were heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them to the country.
These match protests reflect the tear associated with the visitor, a man who is considered a hero by some German Turks and is considered an autocrat by others.
Car accident in Deptford: Biker dies in car collision
A biker has died in a car collision in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10:15 BST.
A driver stopped the car and came paramedics, but the man died on the site.
The accident has occurred some months after another biker died in a ‘taro and fleeing' crash on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers worked to identify the man and inform his closest relationship.
Road closure arrangements and directions have been set and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in hunts
Six officers have been injured in a hunt in a high security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The hunt occurred in His Majesty Long Lartin Prison at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and the case continues.
Officials -Tornado - specialists have been called there to deal with the hunt, which includes eight prisoners and which occur only in one aden.
The minor injuries that the officers had on their faces were treated at the site.
A spokesperson on behalf of the Prisons Service said: —A prison staff with specialist training has gone there to deal with this ongoing incident in His Majesty Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the staff have had treatment for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and they may spend more time in prison.
His Majesty's Long Lartin Prison includes more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June the prison governor was said to have been treated in the hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
And in October last year, anti-terrorist officials were called to prison to deal with a serious hunt where the staff were attacked with a pool of pilgrims.
Rosa Hurricane threatens Big Flood in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Elwa Dry Areas)
Tropical low pressure is a rare thing in Arizona, but that's exactly what is likely to happen beginning next week as the rest of the Rosa Crown traveled across the South West of the Desert, causing a danger of major flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will keep sight of major flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, turning into hand late Monday night.
In a message on Twitter, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said that only —ten tropical cyclones have retained storm status or low pressure within 200 miles to Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles to the AZ boundaries. -
The latest models of the National Centre on Winds predict between 2 and 4 inches in hand, with a few rare examples of a total of up to 6 inches on the Arizona Mogollon Edge.
Other areas in the South West of the Desert including the Great Basin and Rockies the center is likely to have between 1 and 2 inches, with a few cases of a total of up to 4 inches possible.
For those who are not in danger of having a large flood, Rosa rain can be of benefit to them as they live in a dry area.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, it is likely that some of this rain will be beneficial because there are currently dry conditions in the Southwest.
According to U.S. Sychder Monitor, little over 40% of Arizona experienced extreme drought at least, the highest category but one, — said weather.com.
To begin, Rosa's route will lead to land along the Baja California peninsula, Mexico.
Rosa, who was still as strong as a Sunday morning hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving about north by a 12-mile travel per hour.
The storm reaches the colder waters of the Pacific so it weakens.
Because of this, the hurricane is expected to reach the land in Mexico on a tropical storm strength afternoon or Monday night.
The rain could be heavy over parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
—A total expected of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches, - according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a low pressure storm, which will then travel up through Arizona and south Utah reaching late Tuesday night.
—The main danger to be expected in Rosa's skills or the rest of the hurricane is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and South West U.S. Desert, s said the National Centre on Forests.
This rain is expected to create a large flood that can risk life as well as flow of rubble in the wilderness and landslides on mountainous land.

Trump says Kavanaugh has ‘demonstrated of reassurance and anger' of the Democratic Party
-A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to contest the unsuspecting and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party, - Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had —died of reassurance and anger — the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the Congress on Thursday and was under a feeling in denying the conviction of Christine Blasey Ford who claimed he had sexually abused decades ago, and both in their teens.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
The President said on Saturday that —the people of America have seen greatness and the standard and courage - Kavanaugh that day.

The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as speaking about the importance of the Republican assembly in the mid-term elections.
Five weeks are to go until one of the most important elections of our life.
I don't apply, but I'm really trying, - he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere trying to fight for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is —resisting and blocking. ·
The first key legislative debate on down the Senate regarding Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday on the late, senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds were killed by Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number increased
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom had been evacuated off as huge waves broke on the beaches, after a large earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had assembled for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves struck as high as six metres on the end of night beach, swerving much from there and killing them and damaging anything along the route.
The tsunami came following a magnitude 7.5.
—When the warning about the tsunami was received yesterday, people were carrying on with their activities on the beach, they did not run from there immediately and they became victims, — Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman on behalf of Indonesia's disaster evacuation agency, BNPB, said at a briefing meeting in Jakarta.
The tsunami was not on its own, it was a car drag, trunks, houses, it struck against everything on the land, — Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 kya (497 mph) before hitting the edge of the beach.
Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survive.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos of the air published by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops had been damaged, bridges had fallen and a mosque surrounded by water.
Back-ups were still shakeouts of the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area that contained 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by a massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
City agriculture, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the magnitude of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as a one-sex-shotness-and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Some suffering bodies were found trapped under the rubble of fallen buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and that 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and the number of injured people could be greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coast north of Palu, an area called Donggata, which is closer to the summit of the earthquake.
·There was no way to communicate with Donggala to obtain information - Nugroho said.
·More than 300,00 people live there, - the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the areas on which they were affected.
- This is a disaster already, but the situation could worsen suffocate suffocate suffocate suffocate suffocate suffocate suffocate suffocate suffocate suffocate suffocate suffocate suffocate
The agency was allegedly criticised Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had struck Palu, although the officials said the waves had arrived in the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film shared on social media you can hear a man on high down shouting on people in the street below by warning them that a tsunami is on his way.
Within minutes a wall of water struck the shore, carrying buildings and cars from there.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major electric break and turned off the communications around Palu making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but there is a real need for food and other essentials on those who have had to leave their homes.
The city airport has been reopened only for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to go to the rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
Over 800 dead in Indonesia's Tsunami Skill.
She is a terrible stand.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the workers get sheltered in tarpaulin shadows set in the yard of their office, they passed torcalonnus sights on the road, Mr. Doseba said.
—They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed, — he said.
Things are very bad.
Even as aid groups are going to begin the unprecedented process of giving emergency assistance, some have complained that specialist foreign aid workers have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies or staff cannot be provided unless the disaster site has been declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
—It is still a disaster at provincial level, - said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman on behalf of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
—After the government has said, “Just, it's a national disaster,” - we can get international aid, but there's no status yet.
As she nights in Palu for the second time following the earthquake and the tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hoped that their victims were alive through some miracle, which would spread some on the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a small boy was removed from a garrison.
On Sunday, rescuers managed to release a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body at her engagement.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings for the Asian Games, held earlier in the month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said that his disciples were among the others who stuck at the Roa Roa hotel.
“As someone with experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional mate,” he said.
During the hours after the paragliding community heard about the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, Mr. Gendon said that he had sent a number of WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
But there was only one grey tick beside his messages, rather than two blue decks.
- I think that means that the messages have not been sent, - he said.

Kanye West: The rapist changes his name to Ye
The Kanye West rapist changes his name - to Ye.
When publishing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote:
West, aged 41, has since been called Ye and used the name as a title for his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change comes before he appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his New album, Yandhi.
He goes on the show instead of Ariana Grande, the singer of America who did withdraw because of —emotional rites - said the several who created the show.
In addition to being a tribute of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious significance to him.
—I believe that ‘ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means —you - forgive West earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with Big Boy, which presents on the radio.
- So I'm thee, I'm thee, we're this.
The name of Kanye, which means the only one, went to Ye alone - reflecting the good, the evil and the confusion, everything.
The album does more than reflect who we are. ·
It is among many other famous rapists who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has had a variety of names like Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred to have the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to cooperate with West, has also been using his name by varying it in terms of the heifer and the letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use troops against citizens
Mexico's President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use troops against citizens as the country celebrates 50 years since the bloody revenge against students.
On Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised — never to use the military to defeat the people of Mexico. —
Soldiers shot during peaceful resistance on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, and that was when the left wing students raided across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support the young people of Mexico by giving help to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities mean that young people are attracted to crime gangs.
US should double its funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial understanding, U.S. should double the money she spends on research work in the field, said the investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made publications regarding artificial understanding, although U.S. has no formal artificial understanding strategy in general.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year, which is its goal of being the best country in contact with all innovations by 2030.
·Double assurance of the funding for research work in the field of artificial understanding would be a good start, considering that all the other countries are much less developed than U.S., and we are looking for the next discovery in the field of artificial understanding, · Lee said.
Double the funding could mean double the opportunity to ensure that the next major achievement in the field of artificial understanding is achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee has published his book »Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order » with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is Chief Executive of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most advanced artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he was working on an artificial understanding system that beat the best Othello player in America. He later became an active officer in Microsoft Research and the president of the China Google branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions as Her Robotic Agency Advanced Research Projects in the field of Defense, and asked which time would be the next to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to gain grants from the government, Lee said.
—China does not bear the academic leaders; but the corporations, - Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have tried to hire bright students from universities to work on artificial understanding recently.
Also, Lee said that changes to the mute policy could help U.S. to revive its efforts in the field of artificial understanding.
- I believe green cards should be automatically offered to people with doctorate in artificial understanding, - he said.
The China State Council announced its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Institute provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Institute and other government institutions give funds to researchers from the US, but the academic work standard is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Centre, which is to include partners from the industry and from the academic world, and the White House announced that a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence was formed.
And this month DARPA issued an investment in a venture called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research work on artificial understanding.
Meanwhile, US legislation that attempted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been active for months.
The citizens of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the country's era change
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday as to whether the country's name should be changed to —North Macedonia's Republic of Macedonia — which would resolve a conflict that has lasted decades with Greece, which had prevented the Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern allies represents a right on its territory and has prevented the country from becoming part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would fuel the identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a campaign to phoicing has cast doubts as to whether the number of voters will meet the 50 percent target needed to validate the referendum.
This is the referendum question of the referendum: —Are you in favour of becoming a member of NATO and the EU and accepting the agreement with Greece.
Those who are in charge of changing the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying it so that Macedonia, one of the only countries to develop has fallen Yugoslavia, can have access to bodies like the EU and NATO.
“I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because that ensures safer lives for all of us,” said Georgijevska, 79-year-old, in Skopje.
Although they are not legally bound, enough parliament members have said they will expect for the outcome of the vote in order to make it a decisive vote.
To change the name you would have to have a majority of two parts of three in the rank.
The state elections commission said there was no mention of any inconsistencies by 1pm.
However, only 16 percent did vote, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 percent of the voters who had registered voted.
I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe, — Gjose Tanevski, aged 62, said a policeman in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, a change that would mean that the country could join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old prepared a small platform and placed chairs in front of a tent which was set by those who will boycott the regime.
We are from NATO and EU parties, but we want to join by being able to hold our head high, not through the servants' door - said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration. —
Prime Minister Zaev says that becoming a member of NATO will ensure an investment that Macedonia really needs, a country whose unemployment rate is higher than 20 percent.
I believe that the vast majority of parties will be because more than 80 percent of our citizens are from both the EU and NATO, — Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that the result would be —ie — in —confirming our future. —
According to a poll set up last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - which is lower than the required number.
Another poll, held by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents intended to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 percent and one vote.
If the regime fails, that would be the first serious blow to the government's policy that is from the Western party since it took the lead in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, pass all Brighton defenders and get a try
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crashed Brighton defenders during a 2-0 Manchester City victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero to that looked terriblely easy as he scored in 65th minute.
The blower from Argentina got a death in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders, before reaching the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
One defender pushed off before running earlier than many others on the edge of Brighton's box.
He then gave a bass to his left, giving Sterling the ball.
The forward from England used his first encounter in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton's goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan, with a blow to the right side of the net.
Aguero is having some problems with his feet, — Manchester City Manager, Pep Guardiola, told the reporters.
We had discussed that it would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had scored a goal at that time. —
But Sterling gave Chelsea the first advantage in the Advanced League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton territory that time.
He gave a lovely kick through the players along the backyard to Leroy Sane.
Sane tied the ball a few times before Sterling guided about the farthest post.
Chelsea's forward kicked the ball to the net before slipping over the boundaries.
The City of Manchester is playing against Hoffenheim in the Champions League play group at 12:55pm on Tuesday at Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer for playing against the Rockies
Since the Nationals do not have hope to compete in the second opportunity games, there is no much reason for overcoming another starter.
But Scherzer hopes to stand on the bump on Sunday to face the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are improvements in terms of second opportunity games to the Rockies, who save the front on the Los Angeles Dodgers of one game in the NL West league.
The Rockies secured a second chance at least with a 5-2 victory against the Friday night Nationals, but they still hope to secure their place in the first group.
While we don't play for anything, at least we can foot the rubber by knowing that there will be a good atmosphere here with the crowd in Denver and that the other team will play at the highest level that I would face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in a game so -
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but according to the mention they wanted to let Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start for the 34th time, had a practice session on Thursday and would throw on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right hand thrower playing for Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 ‘strikeout' shots in 220 2/3 batting this season.
Trump rallied in North Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation related to his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and he spoke about the importance of the Assembly of the Ministry in the mid-term elections.
—Everything we have done will be the advantage of November.
Five weeks are to go until one of the most important elections of our life.
This is one of the big, big ones - I don't apply but I'm really applying, that's why I travel everywhere struggling for great candidates, - he said.
Trump went before him, —You see the terrible radical group, terrible here, you see this happening this morning.
And they are determined to take the power back by using any mode that is needed, you see the attenuation, the malaise.
They have no ots who are hurt, who they have to pursue on them to have power and control, they want to have power and control, we are not going to give them that.
The Democrats, he said, are trying —to resist and prevent it. -
“And we have seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats a “flin and an innocuous and successful chasm.
He referred to the name of the high-ranking Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and was heard a loud bout among the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Do you share this document?
Y, y, what.
No, the no, wait a moment - that was an example of a bad body language - the worse body language I have ever seen. -
Labour is no longer a global party.
The party does not tolerate those who say they say.
When Momentum's active members in my local party voted to force me to, that was a great surprise.
After all, I'm the latest of many Labour MPs to have heard that there's no welcome to us - and that's what we say.
My senior co-worker, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way for her standing determined against anti-semitism.
In my case, the motion of mayor criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Dispute with him about the importance of responsible economic policy, regarding national security, regarding Europe. These are matters similar to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in their circle.
The announcement for the East Nottingham Labour meeting on Friday marked —we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive. ·
During most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the GC meetings Friday night have been so meetings.
Unfortunately, not a tone so which is in most meetings today and we have old forgotten about the promise of politics —more kind, more tender--whether it ever got that.
It has become increasingly clear that different perspectives are not tolerated in the Labour party and all perspectives are criticized on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Co-workers I used to think they were of the same political anime as I started to expect me to make a pedal turn and support perspectives that I would not have otherwise agreed with - whether that be on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and there is no difference what I will actually say - it will lead to harsh attacks on social media calling for my non-election, condemning the center's politics, telling me that I shouldn't be the Labour party.
And I'm not just who has experienced this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow employees because the comments that are attributed to us tend to be political ones.
I educate the professional and determined nature of those co-workers who face much sexual or racial abuse every day but who don't let that get the best on them.
One of the most disappointed aspects of this period of politics is the way in which levels of abuse have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are not a party so widespread now and with all offers of —the lack of confidence — or a change to the selection rules, the party becomes more narrow.
I've had a lot of advice during the last two years encouraging me to keep my head down, not to express my opinion too much, then I'd be —just. »
But that's not why I've chosen to be a politician.
I joined Labour as a school pupil 32 years ago, having been murdered by the neglect of the Thatcher government, a government responsible for the torcalonnus state of my school district. Since then I have sought to promote better public services for those who are most needed - whether that be as a local councillor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my politics, nor in the last election of times.
Neither anyone in East Nottingham would have been able to misunderstanding my political views and the fields I disagree in their circle with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the proposal on Friday, all I have to say is that I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour party with the country moving towards Brexit that will be a blow to households, businesses and to our public services.
But, in fact, not a message to Momentum Nottingham that I have, but a message to my electorate, in Labour members or not: I am glad to serve you and I promise that there will be no number of threats of my non-election or political convenience in my quest from acting in the way I believe is best for you all.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Father angers at the top
Two late tries may have lasted some on the final result, but it is certain that Ayr deserves to win this Senior Tennent match.
They are now at the top of the table, the only team that has not been beaten from the ten.
Finally, their excellent defense work, as well as their work of taking advantage of opportunities, was responsible for supporting the home team and the coach, Peter Murchie, had all right to be proud.
We've had challenging games so far, but no one has beaten us, so I have to be content with, — he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: —Ayr’s praise, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did. —
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, made sure that Ayr was on the front. However, the yellow card that got the Scottish cap, Rory Hughes, which was released for the Warriors game, meant that Melrose was able to take advantage of that and Jason Baggot chipped an unconverted try.
Climo ensured that Father was more than ever on the front with a penalty chic, before he, before just half time, scored and converted a single try to secure a score of 17-5 to Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's request, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a bit of delay because Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured, and was carried away on stressier. After they resumed, Ayr received more success following a request from Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Then Ayr's temporary captain, Blair Macpherson, got a yellow card, and again, Melrose made the extra player pay with an unconverted try by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Stuan Hutchinson got a yellow card for dazzling Climo without the ball, from the penalty kick line, MacPherson brought the ball down behind the increasing skirms of Ayr.
Climo turned the try, as he did again almost immediately after a restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent forward forward Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth try.
Star Still Game looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, one of Still Game's stars, hopes to move to the hospitality industry after he finds that he has been named director of a licensed dining company.
The 56-year-old man is playing Jack Jarvis on the popular show by the BBC, along with writing and acting in conjunction with his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duet has announced that the ninth series on the web will be the final series in the show's history and that Kiernan is probably planning for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but one of Scottish Sun's sources suggested that Kiernan hoped to be part of —more fun eatings - Glasgow.
‘No seabbs': Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Marines patrolled a rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings waved a blue flag like the sea.
Maritime centers from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the signs: -The seabass are not by right.
Its recovery is a duty. —
Bolivia is surrounded and the reminder of the forlin that was lost to Chile in bloody resistance over resources in the 19th century is still alive - in the same way as the dhead for sailing the Pacific again.
These hopes are unclear than they have been for decades, as Bolivia waited for a verdict by the international justice court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has momentum, a sense of unity and silence, and as a reason she is confident in waiting for the result, — said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat from Bolivia.
A number of Bolivian citizens will watch the award of the international justice court on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribune in the Hag will decide from Bolivia's claim party - after decades of spying talks - that Chile must discuss giving the sea an opener to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, a charismatic president who is a native of Bolivia - who faces a legitimate battle for second-election next year - relies largely on the award Monday.
- We are very close to returning to the Pacific, - said the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is not likely to decide from the Bolivian party - and many would not change if the court did so.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to condemn Chilean territory, and has demanded that it not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that the verdict of the international court of justice comes only six months after the final arguments were heard suggesting that the case was not a complex one, Paz Zárate, a husband of Chile who specializes in international law, said.
And instead of improving the Bolivian case, it is possible that the last four years have worsened the case.
—The current Bolivian administration has apologised on this issue concerning access to the sea, — Zárate said.
Morales' wary rhetoric has fueled any good will that Chile had after, he suggested.
Sometime, Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged courts since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in the Hag, rejected the idea that the court's decision making process is usually a quick process.
Monday will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new period of ties with Chile - and an opportunity to -run an end on 139 years of disagreement over the benefits of a culprit, - he said.
Also, Calzadilla denied that Marales - who is still one of America's most popular Latin presidents - used the maritime matter as a political barrier.
-Bolivia will not surrender its right to access the Pacific, sniffing it.
The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea says it will not remove its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will not remove its nuclear weapons unless the member trusts Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to stick at the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears so that he is about to resume nuclear diplomacy that he would not be able to reach agreement, and that more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong One of North Korea.
Ri says that the idea is that only a grassroots dream is that continuing sanctions and US opposition to declare an end to the Korean War will make North surrender.
Washington stolen from agreeing with the statement before Pyongyang made significant disarmament moves first.
Kim and the US President, Donald Trump, want to have a second summit.
But there is much doubt as to whether Pyongyang seriously wants to surrender weapons that the country, most likely, considers them as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the latest collection of huge headwear is about to reach your High Street
If you want another hat or if you want to stop the sun completely, this is the fashion for you.
The Valentino and Thom Browne designers have revealed a variety of huge and experimental headsets for their SS19 collection on the fashion platform, which shined on the style set in the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unusual hats have appeared on Instagram this summer and the outstanding creations of these designers have been seen on the fashion platform.
One of Valentino's striking items was a sandy hat over the top of a china decorated with a plumbing wide edge covering the tops of the models.
Among the other great accessories were water melons decorated with games, a wizard hat and an even pine-afal - but these hats would not warm up your head.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of strange mystics- and that in good time for Halloween.
Many of the colored mystics had lips sewn together and were biased to Hannibal Lecter than to armoured equipment.
One of them was similar to a scuba-bleeder dress with snorcel and goggles, and another looked like an ice cream cone, and that had melted.
And, if you enjoy big fashion statements- this is your opportunity.
Those who keep a look at style predict that huge bonds could reach your large street.
These large hats follow the ‘La Bomba' style, the popular straw hats with the two-foot wide edge, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind these unusual hats seen on social media had another large creation on the fashion platform too - a straw bag almost as large as the module in a swimming dress that carried it.
The burning orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia edge and white leather handle, was one of the most striking items in the collection of La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus in the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous Luke Armitage stylist told FVIDEO: ‘I expect to see large hats and beach bags arrive at the big street next summer - as the designer has made so much impression, it would be difficult to avoid the call for large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools hold a good reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, and that is only complemented by individual and collective success in the fields of sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, which are represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SSIS), seek to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for further education and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a mainstream school curriculum, I see modern languages still being popular topics that are selected in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: -If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, that will stay in his memory.
If you are talking to someone in his own language, that will remain in the heart.
This is a powerful message to remind us that we can only rely on English when trying to develop connections and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the results of this year's exams recently, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables and include the highest passing rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages have had a grade A high.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are a member of SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students had a grade A High in Mandarin, and that 72 percent of those who were studying German, 69 percent of those who were studying French and 63 percent of those who were studying Spanish had A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Now languages, like subjects, are treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools curriculum and elsewhere.
A UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey in 2014 has found that a lack of linguistic skills was responsible for 17 percent of the reasons that employers were unable to fill vacant jobs.
Therefore, there is a greater demand for languages in order to prepare young people for their careers to the future.
With more artificial job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a global environment.
No matter what career someone chooses, if that individual has learned a second language, he will have a real future advantage of having such long-term skills.
Communication ability directly with people in other countries will mean that a dual-step person will immediately be on the front.
According to a poll by YouGov which included more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 73 percent were unable to speak foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. In addition, French was the only language spoken by a double figure percentage of 15 percent.
This is the reason that investment in language education is important for children today.
The ability of many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance to find significant work.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages they will teach.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, but other schools will teach languages that are considered the most important ones for the UK when looking around 2020, like Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages from which he can choose in independent schools, and the schools will include teaching staff who are engaged in this field.
Independent schools of Scotland have committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever is ahead of them.
It is not currently possible to deny, in a global business environment, that languages are still universal to the future of the country, so that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered the —skills of international communication. ·
Independent schools will still offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people of Scotland.
I've got to watch.
John Edward is Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
LeBron played his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The stay is almost on top for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' coach, has announced that James will play in the opening game of the series before the start of the Sunday season receiving the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he has not decided for how many minutes he will play yet.
·It will be more than one but less than 48, - Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers' correspondent, Mike Trudell, gave a message on Twitter saying that it is likely that James will play a few minutes.
After an exercise session earlier in the week, James was questioned about his plans for the Lakers' six game schedule before the start of the season.
- In this period in my career I don't need games before the season in order to prepare, - he said.
West Virginia Trump Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five races scheduled for the next week, including visits and friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice for the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking support for the mid-term elections as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below using a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the hearings this week for his nomination to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which is under stress as a result of sexual misconduct claims with the vote to confirm him in the parliament postponed for up to a week as the FBI investigated.
But the main goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans face hard elections in November to win a few momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that the five rally over the next week would be aimed at —spoke volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to defend and add to the majority they have in Parliament and the House of Representatives, — according to Reuters.
·Control of Congress is so important to its agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible as no start on the important campaigning season, - a spokesperson from Trump's campaign, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
In being held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, a rally tonight could come and supporters of —Ohio and Pennsylvania and get attention from the Pittsburgh media, — according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second work for Trump to visit West Virginia in the last month, a province that won from more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate to West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the pinion polls.
- She is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come here to try to boost him in the pinion poles, - said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows the pluck to fight on as they go to individual games Sunday
After three one sided sessions, Saturday afternoon quartet could be the exact thing this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum pencil is a concept that has been imagined in the sports world but it is a concept in which the players believe in it especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say that the momentum is currently?
They were at the front of six points and now it's four, so we have a little momentum about making me, squirt Jordan said as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the plain with another twelve to play.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel they have little wind in their mood and have enough to encourage them, especially by Speith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and got three points out of four each.
Speith has been excellent from thee to the grain and it leads through an example.
The screams of celebration went higher as their round went ahead, managed with a vital pit to go on a gem to four each though it was from and Thomas had been down two after two.
There was a similar scream after the pot that won the gem for them on the 15, the kind of scream that tells you that it doesn't believe America is out of it yet.
- You need to focus and worry about your own game, - said Speith.
This is the only thing these players have after now.
18 holes to create an impression.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup defensive story.
An odd but pleasant European couple has four for four and they can do nothing wrong with it. —
It was the only bar not to get bogi Saturday afternoon, and they were not bogi Saturday morning, Friday afternoon or last nine Friday mornings.
That run, and a way in which the energy flows between them and the crowd confirms that they are the players to beat them on Sunday, which the same player would be more popular to confirm Europe's victory as their minor right over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible both on the same pry on different holes.
But, it is an early rush to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero of the morning, easily put when he was barred by Alex Noren.
Following bogi and two doubles in the first nine were the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole that they came not close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday no one is to help you out of your hole.
There are four pâls and the interesting mod quadrants to watch because of the relationship between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way the strategy can change in seconds.
So far Europe has played better as a team and they lead from a bit at the beginning of last day, but the four-day session has proved that the U.S. Team has the ability to fight, something some especially in the U.S. suspected.
Europe ahead of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after finishing four ball games and fours on Saturday 10-6 in front of the US.
The amazing duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two victories over Tiger Woods to go and score them so far in Le Golf National to four points.
European squadman Thomas Bjorn, who attempted to regain the trophy after his loss in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American poor squad in four balls the morning by going and the series to 3-1.
The U.S. gave more resistance in the fourties, but they could not get rid of the lack.
Jim Furyk's car needs eight points of 12 individual games Sunday in order to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rugby to win four points after each other and he and Molinari, who have been called the —Molliwood - after an amazing weekend, are the second bar to get four points from their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls they worked greatly to beat Woods on American Rugby Bryson Dechambeau from 5 and 4.
Wood, who dragged himself two games on Saturday, had some special opportunities but has lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and fours and sevens after each other.
Justin Rose, having dismantled for the morning ball pedigree, returned as a partner to Henrik Stenson in the quartets and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka who are first and third in the world from 2 and 1.
Everything went not from European parties on a nice and quiet day in western Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points Saturday.
They made a win of 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four balls and later they made Polter and Rory McIlroy of 4 and 3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from that four points behind at the start of the individual games, though the Furyk squad only needed an equal score as they are the holders of the trophy.
But, after being second for two days, coming in their light on Sunday looks as if beyond their ability.
North Korea says they will not de-armed one-sided without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said the value of the United Nations that the ongoing sanctions strengthened corruption in the U.S. and that the country will not remove its nuclear weapons is one-sided under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the international organisation that North Korea had taken —a significant good will steps — in the past year, like stopping nuclear exercises and explosives, detonating the site of nuclear experiments, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons or nuclear technology.
But, we don't see such a response from the U.S., - he said.
No confidence in the U.S. will be our country-wide security and in such circumstances we cannot first de-armed ourselves.
Although Ri had repeated North Korea's instructional complaints about Washington's opposition from a graded response to de-nuclearization where his North Korea will be rewarded when adopting graduate steps, his statement was to see significant as he did not refuse to dismantled one-sided entirely as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement between Kim John Un and Donald Trum at the first convention between the current president of the US and the North Korean arsenal in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work towards —a non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula - while Trum promised to guarantee Korea's security.
North Korea has been trying to get a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said that Pyongyang must first stop its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused calls to leak the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
—The U.S. requires to have -un-negotiated first-personisations - and they increase the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve their goal in a forceful manner, and they even oppose the —demonstration to end the war, suffocate the RI.
—The creation that sanctifications can defeat us is a dream by people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions strengthen our evil. ·
Ri did not mention plans for a second convention between Kim and Trump, a convention the president was sworn in at the United Nations a week earlier.
Instead the minister pointed out the three meetings between Kim and South Korean Moon leader Jae-in over the last five and added: —If South Korea would be the party to the issue of de-nuclearization and not the US, de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not lead to such an impossible situation. ·
For this reason Ri's speech wax was very different last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. with North Korea's rockets was annoyed after —Mr. Dr. Dr. Drwg - Trump called Kim's —a rocket's typhoon - on a self-determination course.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage taking steps to issue-arms, but said that there was a lot of work to do again and that the sanctions had to wait until North Korea was Un-nuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he does not have a specific period for this, saying that —if he takes two years, three years or five months - there's no matter. -
China and Russia argue that the United Nations General Assembly should reward Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
But, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday: —The sanctions of the Security Council must be strictly enforced and unfavorable until we realize and confirm a finished de-nuclearization.
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in order to try to limit the funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and telecommunications programs.
Ri met Pompeo on the outskirts of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in order to prepare for a second convention.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not stop.#
Pyongyang left in July saying that progress had been, but for North Korea he accused it within hours of making —orders like gangster. ·
North Korea has promised to meet with Moon this month in order to dismantle the position of missiles and nuclear site if the U.S. took —correspondent steps. ·
He said that Kim had told him that the —Competitional steps - he was asking them were the security guarantees that Trump had promised them in Singapore and movements towards normalizing the relationship with the US.
Harvard students get a course available enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is underway to sleep more in order to try to tackle the macho culture of studying all night using caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world's best university are often undeniable when it comes to the essentials of eddy you after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham Hospital and Women who have designed the course, a course he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired the beginning of the course after giving lecture on the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
‘At the end of the lecture a girl came to and said: ‘Why is it just now I get to know this, in my last year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleep--it was surprising to me,' he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is first presented this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, along with improving their well-being in general.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatric at Harvard Medical School and the university's active director of health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were suffering from a serious sleep injury during the week.
The hourly course still includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, the participants learn how a lack of sleep for a long time increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily practices.
‘We are aware that it will not change the students' behavior immediately.
But we are of the opinion that they have a right to know--in the same way as you have a right to know what a smoking effect is on your health,' added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of being proud to stay up through night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that a lack of sleep is a problem that goes worse,
It should make sure you get enough sleep, and that quality, be a way for students to tackle stress, fatigue and obesity, he said - even to avoid putting pressure on, since lack of sleep makes the brain believe you are hungry, making you hungry through the time
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from Galifornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, after studying one of his courses last year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and had ‘inspired to try to get the course for the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to require all post-graduate students to complete a similar study plan before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm for going to sleep, along and to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light' which is released by electronic screens and LED light, which can affect your circadian rhythm by leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: goal by Menga beats Gerrard men
Rangers suffered another poor game from home as Dolly Menga's goal led to a loss of 1-0 to Steven Gerrard's undefeated team at Livingstone.
The Ibrox team were looking for their first victory on the way since they beat St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt Gerrard's team beat for only the second work in 18 games as a manager to leave the team eight points behind higher league leaders Ladbrokes who are Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and Rangers' team was short of inspiration and no sight of ability to become equal.
While Rangers now fall to sixth position, Livingstone rises to third only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more troubles to Rangers after the Calum Spence luller had to get treatment to injury to his head after something was thrown from the top of the visitors.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team and beat Ayr to reach the Betfred Cup's pre-season games.
On the other hand, Holt stayed with the 11 who beat Hearts last week and would be delighted with the way his organized squad did to convince their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may have doomed in terms of possession but Livingstone made more with the bee when she had them.
They should have scored after just two minutes after Menga's pass gave Scott Pittman an opportunity on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder failed his chance by hitting the ball clear.
He made a deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs finding captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could not hit the clear at the back post.
Rangers were ruling but there was more hope than believed in their play in the game's final season.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have had a kick from the smuggling after about a quarter of an hour after he and Steven Lawless hit but the rival Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian appeals.
Rangers got two shots for the target in the first half but found before goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly had no trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's decision and Ovie Ejaria's shot.
Although Livi's goal after 34 minutes has been against the play's run, no one can argue that they did not deserve it for their hard work alone.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with and Jacobs' deep playing plans.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the bel to Scott Robinson, who was excited when he passed it to Menga for easy completion.
Gerrard was as a brake as he changed Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and nearly the switch had an immediate effect as the winger passed to Morelos but Kelly rushed from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's career could have added to their score in the last few minutes but McGregor rose well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow failed a penalty from the corner.
Second Rangers Glenn Middleton had another try for a kick from the pitch after a collision with Jacobs but Thomson ignored the try again.

Evans: —Well, it makes quite a bit of noise now-
—Hans - Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his birthday at 63.
But the device that was named after him continues to be used.

Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington kills on poison root
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow's violent HBO Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has killed on the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys feel that they have to be hard to be respected.

‘What have we been learning for men as they grow, in terms of the problem we now have?'
Kit is of the opinion that television is partly responsible for the progress in ventricular husbandry and that is due to the very male characters.
He went ahead: ‘What's current and what's being taught?
What is being taught on television, and on the streets, which makes boys feel that they have to be a special kind of man?
In my opinion that is one of the great questions of our life - how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something has gone wrong for young men.'

About 40,000 new cases were marked in the second quarter of 2018 alone.

Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of heated blood supplies.
But the number of people holding HIV like this has been nearly reduced to nothing, Chinese health officials said at a convention in Yunnan province.
But, from year to year, the number of people in China living with HIV and Aids has increased from 100,000 people.
HICV transmission by some is a major problem in China's LHDT community.
Equality was deported in 1997, but according to the mention that discrimination against LHDT people is ramp.
Due to the country's naval values, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transfers of the sizes result in inadequate sex security in these relatives.
Since 2003, the China government has promised general access to HIV medication as part of a plan to address the problem.

On Saturday Representative Maxine Waters denied accusations that a member of his staff had posted information about three Republican Senators to the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Democrat from Los Angeles demanded that the accusations be spread by bundits —an extreme right-wing seduction seduction seduction seduction sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative sedative s

As mentioned the information that was released included home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The online information spread Thursday, after being posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing from a panel of Parliament on charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh who has been nominated to the Supreme Court.
The information was released after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Consumer websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address stating the source of the postings was related and Waters office and they released information member of Waters staff, reported the Hill.

Waters' statement was criticised the fast online, including by former press secretary at the White House Ari Fleischer.

—We will make sure that the criminals are exposed to crime, severance - and that they are accountable for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to all members of my staff.
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - paving weak spy with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film that has a British orientation and it is to see fit for this revival of the Johnny English comedy ready series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is self a tongue in the cheek on how sobor we won't have the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, the non-glem Johnny English has been licensed to destroy everything back for the second work - with its name more than none showing that it is a comic character that has been created for cinematic attendees in non-English speaking countries.
Of course this is the true spy who for his noble demands included a small few Closes, Mr Bean, on a man who contributed one note to by the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
Originally based on the passenger and mysterious man Atkinson played it in Barclaycard's advertisement, leaving destruction after him.
There are one or two good scenes in the latest Johnny English film.
I would love to see Johnny English going towards a helicopter wearing an armour and the rotor's blades hit against his helmet.
Atkinson's dance with physical comedy is to be seen, but the humour is weak and strangely unnecessary, especially now that filmmaking is now a #seriously serious-like 007 and an Impossible Mission offers comedy as an element of their films.
The humour feels like it was unveiled to children rather than adults, and for me the true victims of Johnny English are not as clever and specific as Atkinson's quiet jokes in Bean's persona.
The interim idea is that Great Britain is in great trouble.
A cyber hacker has committed to Britain's secret network of spies, releasing the identity of all the spies that Britain has in the field, although the hidden-scene on duty - a sad and small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last step for a prime minister of self-righteous and surrounded, and who is already suffering from massive political abduction. Emma Thompson does his best with the character Teresa Mayan but there is a great deal in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all spies have been risked and that it will be some for her to come and someone out of retirement.
And this means Johnny English himself, who works as a schoolmaster in some criminal institution now, but gives secret lessons on how to be a spy: some good jokes here, as English offers a school-like spying to School from f Rock.
English is pasted back to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and he gets a reunion with his former partner Bough, being played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to an underwater ship's companion, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is tortured.
So the Batman and Robin of having things wrong back on his Majesty's service, come across Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is busy being briefed by a charismatic technology billionaire claiming that dealing with Britain's computer problems: Jason Vola may be played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their laughing journey: dressed as servers, they put a French-French restaurant on fire; create a hunt when trying to get on a Volta luxury ship; and English causes complete unrest when trying to use a Virtual tool to communicate with the inside of Volta house
They make a very show from it in the final scene, but for so fun and irresponsible, there is little feeling of children's TV about all the thing.
Very nice.
And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't think: British film industry can't give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes fair play with his talents?
The Labour party denied that it was preparing a plan for the British people to work for four days a week but were paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would mean that British people work a week of four days - but are paid for five.
According to the mention the party wants the heads of companies to pass the savings made through the artificial understanding revolution on to the workers by giving them an extra day away.
It would mean that employees get a weekend of three days - but get the same wage.
Sources that say the idea would match the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country from the workers' party.
A change to a four-day week has been approved by the Labour Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A high source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: ‘a policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight but a four-day week is a high-rise that matches the party's attitude towards restructuring the economy from the workers' party as well as the party's general climate strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a work week of four days during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, currently the summit is not approved by the Labour Party all.
A spokesperson on behalf of the Labour Party said: ‘A work week of four days is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Chancellor John McDonnell used the party's convention last week to expand his vision for socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to have the power backed by ‘unnamed directors' and ‘privileges' of the public resource companies.
The cable's Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies will not be all reliant as the Labour government could make ‘didnances' on the basis of apparent evils.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create a comprehensive Ownership Funds to give 10 percent of the equity of companies; the private sector in the hands of the employees, would have annual investments of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy commented on —60 Minutes - whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their thoughts
The FBI's investigation into claims against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and he raises the question whether the FBI's findings could cause any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, reporter Scott Pelley asked ‘the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was to see more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
- On course, swivel Kennedy said.
—If I said to before the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I phoned him after this happened, after the charges came out, I said, ‘Do you do this?'
He was certain, determined and unresponsive. —
However, Graham's plea to see is firm.
—I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and would take a terrible conviction, — he said.
—Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was completely wading him, suffocating Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
—And no one could name them confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new in change. -
What is the World Heritage Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the World Heritage Festival, an annual musical event with a striking list of stars taking part and a message that is equally attractive: removing poverty worldwide.
Now in its seventh year, the World Heritage Festival will see tens of thousands of people jump to the Great Lawn at Central Park to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and also to raise awareness of the main purpose of the festival which is to remove extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Heritage Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Heritage Plan, an international advocacy group that hopes to remove poverty by increasing the number of people struggling against it .
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or —actions - such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or anything other valuable to help raise awareness of their goal of removing poverty.
But how successful has the World Heritage Festival been with just 12 years after reaching their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to persuade people to demand a change or just another cause of —clicktivism -- people feel that they are making a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the World Heritage Festival says they have recorded more than 19 million —actions - by their supporters, aimed at a variety of characters.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to publish commitments and policies equivalent to $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In late 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and publications derived from their actions, with at least $10 billion of it having been classified u or raised.
The group estimates that the funding that has been confirmed so far has had a direct effect on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investment partnership and activists who have committed to —helping children reach their full potential, - promising to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help remove a lack of nutrition in the country after getting over 47,00 tweets from Global Citizens.
With help from the UK government, participants, state governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make a social unfairity and lack of nutrition in a footstep in history, - Tracey Ullman's journalist The Power of Nutrition told the crowd at a live conference in London in April 2018.
The group said the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritious food, after over 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions and their website was asking - what makes you think we can get rid of extreme poverty?
The World Heritage Festival replied:  —It will be a long path and a calamity - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the civil and anti-apartheid rights movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for sniffing sniffing sniffing snuging snuging snuging snuging snuging snuging snuging snuging snuging snuging snuging snuging snuging snugsing snuging snuging snuging snuging snug
Washington -if necessary - can use the Navy to prevent energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's intervention in Syria - specifically, where it acts on the invitation of the legal government - is excused to explore new energy markets.
I am of the opinion that the reason that they are in the Middle East is that they want to deal in energy as they mean doing it in eastern Europe, and southern Europe, — he said according to the mention.
And, according to the officer, there are ways to address this.
—The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that the sea routes are open, and, if necessary, to give siege, to make sure that their past does not reach the market, - he said.
Zinke greeted the audience in an event that was being held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group not for profit that describes itself as the —liability of the energy user - in the US.
She went on to compare Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they were more or less the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure and take a fuel place, - he said by stating that the Russian economy is completely dependent and fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump government seeks to increase exports from its liquid natural gas to Europe, taking place in Russia, the cheapest option of down for users in Europe.
To that perspective Trump's government officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to convince Germany to withdraw from a plan of —amidst amidst the North Stream 2 pipeline, which according to Trump makes Berlin a swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath swath s s swath swth s  swath swath swath s swath s
Moscow has repeatedly repeated that the North Stream 2 pipeline is only an economic project worth $11 Billion and will double the current capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's green opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
-In my opinion we share the belief that energy cannot be used to give weight and that the users should be able to choose their suppliers,  » Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US's stand-up has sparked a green response from Germany, which has confirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry institution, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US to keep track of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
-I have a problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply, - Dieter Kempf said head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

During a meeting at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered applying.

U.S. court accuses China of bullying with ‘proprietary complaints'
A week after one of China's official newspapers ran a four-page advertisement in a daily newspaper in the U.S. promoting trade benefits between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily attachment in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's most popular newspaper - after accused China of attempting to intervene in the US congressional elections on November 6, allegations that China denied them.
US officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. elections was a new step in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to set up notices that promote trade, currently Beijing and Washington are fighting an increasing trade war that has led to both countries setting tolls on imports of each other.
China's toll was early in the trade war designed to target exporters in provinces like Iowa supporting Trump's Republican Party, said experts from the US and China.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, a significant exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, —China now confirms that bullies by running advertising advertisements in our free press. ·
—After the spread of his propaganda, the China government takes advantage of America's important tradition of freedom of opinion and freedom of the press by setting a notice they have paid for in the Des Moines Register, — Branstad wrote.
On the contrary, in the newspaper stand down this street in Beijing, you'd find it difficult to find disparate voices that you wouldn't see very reflections of the various ideas that the people of China have about China's anxious economic path, as the press is under China's Communist Party's faction, · he wrote.
He added that — one of China's foremost newspapers has rejected the proposal to publish — its article, though not said which paper.
Analysts Warning that the Republicans are without Women Voted before the Middle Term Elections with Llanast Kavanaugh
As a number of leading Republicans supported the nomination to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the prosecution of several charges of sexual misconduct, analysts have warned that they will see a response, especially by women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions regarding this have been very high, and the majority of Republicans on the record are already saying they want to proceed with the vote.
You can't pull these things back up, — Grant Reeher, a professor of political sciences at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University told The Hill in an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said he doubted whether the last minute effort of Senator Jeff Flake (G-Arizona) to have an investigation by the FBI would be enough to silence unhappy voters.
—Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November, — said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior national adviser and spokesperson to the leading group MoveOn on Friday, according to the newspaper from Washington, D.C.
Fore Friday, protesters were shouting —A coming man's November slump - as they protested in the Senate's assembly as the Republicans ruling ‘the Judicial Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Doctor Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
-Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation is going to be huge,  » Stu Rothenburg, a non-democrat political analyst, told the news website.
—People say they are proudly ready; that's true.
But there could be an increase, especially among unsolicited women on the outskirts of the towns and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who although they do not like the president often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her allegations of sexual violence against the nominee to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a strong response would be if the Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
-This has developed to be a complete mess to the Republicans, - Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
—This is only about the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt and this and the way they have dealt with it, - Guy Cecil, director of Priorities ISA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, indicated at the news channel.
But it seems that Americans are divided as to who to coel them following Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with little more alongside Kavanaugh.
A new opinion survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents are sure or are against believing Ford's evidence, while 35% say they are sure or probably believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% said they believed it was certain or I suppose Kavanaugh had said lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After the campaign by Flake, the FBI is now investigating the claims made by Ford together and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, said the Guardian.
Ford gave evidence on oaths near almost the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her while drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez claims to Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Goruchel Court, to find out her sexual organs for her while they were at a party during their time studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor proposes to Start a New Internet in order to Go to the Apple with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web engineer, is starting a new company that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology pioneer's new project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid lets users choose where their data is stored and who access what information.
In a selection interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee emphasised that the intention of the company Inrupt was —the management of the world. —
- We have to do it now, - he said about the company.
It's a historical moment. ·
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data store-- themselves or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional resources.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and i with at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is up to the user completely who gets to see what kind of information.
The company calls it a —personal authorship through data. ·
The idea about Inrupt, according to Company Chief Executive John Bruce, is for the company to bring appropriate resources, processes and skills to help ensure Solid is available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform by IBM, developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers worldwide could create their own declared apps using the resources available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to —Facebook and Google about introducing an entire change where their business models are completely greened overnight.
—We do not ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that —Inrupt's intention is to provide commercial and ecosystem energy to help protect the accuracy and quality of the new web that is created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the issue over the availability of the Internet.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the Global Web Consortium and Director, the Web Consortium, and the Open Data Foundation.
I am extremely hopeful for this next weekend in the history of the web, - Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating Clergy Cross Victoria World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Vice Colonel Bernard Vanny won an award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglese and Lehaucourt.
But, he was killed by a hidden shooter four days later without knowing that he had won Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two husbands in a commemoration in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was extremely symbolic that the stone was unveiled just 100 years after the sport that won the award to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1928 the Vice-Chair Vann led his fatality across the Canal de Saint-Quentin — through thick fog and attacks by field guns and machine guns.
He later rushed to the landing line and with the most bravery - led the line forward before rushing to a field gun on his own and landing three of the crew.
Vice-Chair Vann was killed by a German shooter on October 4, 1918 - a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather are something —we can't possibly compare but which is a fallacy of someone.
He and his brother Doctor James Vann set a torch after the march, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that it was —very proud of having been part of the marched up-and-out-the-out-of-the-day, adding —a real hero courage being shown by the support that is given by so many people. ·
MMA fans stayed on their feet all night to watch Bellator 206, they put Peppa Pink in place
Imagine this, you've stayed on your feet through the night to watch Bellator 206 just to be banned from watching the main show.
The event from San Jose included 13 matches, including a try on the main card and was shown live through the UK goal on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face each other, the spectators in the UK were left bitter as the screen switched to Peppa Pink.
Some were unhappy at of them waiting on their feet all night particularly to watch the match.
One supporter on Twitter described the change to a children's cartoon as —any kind of bad joke. —
—Government regulations stated that the content was not suitable after 6 a.m. so it had to change to children's programs, — Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication to Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
The pig's peppa, sie.
Scott Coker president of Bellator's company said they will work on their schedule so that it includes viewers in the UK in the future.
—I think when thinking about the re-showing, that we can do it work, — Coker said.
—But she is six o'clock this morning on Sunday there whether we will not be able to deal and this is until it is Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when the programs changed many text messages were going back and forth and they were all not friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought there was a technical problem.
But that was not the problem, it was a governmental matter.
I promise this will not happen next time.
We'll have to keep it to five matches rather than six - as normal - we tried to give too much to the fans and it was a long ride.
It's a sad situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘substantial' because of his sexuality
The plumber Tom Daley says he has grown up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that this has been motivated to succeed.
The 24-year-old plumber said that he had not realized until he went to high school —not everyone like me.
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs to be presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about gay rights in order to give —hopefuls — to other people.
He also said that becoming a parent had made him worry less about winning the Olympic games.
The usual presenter of the long-established program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months of break due to illness.
Looking like a guest on Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt that he was either a man or another when she grew up — since she was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls. ·
He said: »Today, those feelings of feeling less than, of feeling different, have given me the power and strength to succeed. »
He wanted to prove that he was —something, —he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they came to know about his sexuality.
The plumber who has won a two-time Olympic bronze medal has become a prominent LHDT campaigner and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more non-proliferation countries to counter-revolutionaryism.
He said that he had declared his opinion because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without implications and that he wanted to give —hopefully — to other people.
The world commander said that he fell in love with a man - the American film maker Dustin Lance Black, whose meeting he made in 2013 - had been unexpected. —
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than from, last year but said that the age gap has never been a problem.
—When someone goes through so much very young - she went to her first Olympic games at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had lived through similar highlights and lower points.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his —all perseverance was succeeded — has changed.
—If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning a gold medal, - he said.
—But, there are more things than winning Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist. —
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having a diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that the one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 again - he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him ‘you're not going to be around to be in the good front row', - he said.
—I was trapped in his hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and he had died the woman to recognize that he was not of our inconsistency, — he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
—I knew that this was what I had dreamed about throughout my life - to bluff in front of a home crowd in Olympic Games, there was no better feeling, sniffing.
He also inspired his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - who had reassigned with from before the Olympic games and was still giving him beer skin.
Desert Island Discs are on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not at best on the bench for the Saturday Ryder Cup
American Phill Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his standard to avoid having an unhappy mile stone.
Mickelson, who plays in the two-year event for the 12th time, was put on the bench by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for the games left the head and fours.
Instead of being in the middle of the activity, as it has been so frequent for the United States, Mickelson, who has won five majors, shared his day between being an advocate and working on his gem in the hope of improving the problems he has.
As the straightest of drivers wasn't even at the top point of his career, the 48-year-old player is not a good choice for the Le Golf National tight course, where the long rough penalties crude shots.
And if the course itself is not frightening enough, Mickleson, in the ninth game Sunday in the proper face of British Open Championship winner Francesco Molinari, who has collaborated with the rugby Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the beginning of the 12 single games, got a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely vital.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, though he could not do anything else.
—He understood the role he had today, beat my back and put his arm from my scope and said he would be ready tomorrow, — Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I did not predict that it would play two games.
I predicted more, but as then she had worked out and as then we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else. »
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the largest number of Ryder Cup games Sunday.
It could be an end to the Ryder Cup career that has never reached the high lengths of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halfs, although Furyk says his presence was an undeniable boost to the team.
—It's funny, sarcastic, frivolous, it's like making fun of people's head, it's a great person to get it in the team room, - he explained.
—I think the young players were having fun making fun of it too, this week, it was nice to see.
It contributes much more than just aware. -
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of individual games in the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Daniad got his first game at Valderrama in 1997, where a team was capped by Steve Ballesteros' advantage of five points over the Americans, but by the end line the advantage was down to a bowling trick with Europe winning from 141–2 to 131–2.
Remember yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won but only from a bowling thickness, - said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team win 5 to 3 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10 to 6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You must try your best tomorrow.
Go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the trophy, and that's where we will focus.
I've said since the beginning, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our squad, but we're also aware of what that stands the och--the best players in the world.
He was delighted with the way his players have performed on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: —I would never be great about this.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come before, and that is a completely different thing to do.
It's great to have that out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there on your own, you're tested to the quite like a golfer.
That's the message that needs to be given to the players, which is to do your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he must also do his best. -
Unlike Bjorn, American captain Jim Furyk will want his players to perform individually better than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk has been on both ends in the major victories on the last day, as he was part of the team that won in Brookline before losing after Europe secured the -Wirth in Medina. ·
—I remember all words of it, — he said after being questioned how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, made a boost to his players before the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to start quickly as you’ve seen in Brookline, as you’ve seen in Medina.
When the momentum goes in one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those games in the middle.
We set our line so and put the men out as we want, we're trying to do something amazing tomorrow. »
Thomas has had the task of trying to lead the battle back and facing Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other European players in the top half of the order.
—I went to with this group of players in this order because I believe they will work well all the way, - Bjorn said about his choice for the individual games.
New Warship Germany Retired Again
The new frigate of Germany's worms should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old warships from the period of the cold war, but will not be available until the next year at least due to increasing faulty and costly systems, local media said.
The commissioning of the -Rheinland-Palatinate, - the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates , has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper referring to a spokesman on behalf of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems after its delivery have plagued the faculty of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
According to the mention they will include powerful cannon, rows of anti-aircraft and anti-ships planes together and some mystery technologies, such as radar signature, infrared and less sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - there should be a way to find out the new frigates for up to two years away from their home ports.
But ongoing delays mean that the pioneering warships - which will allow ‘Germany to throw its power over the sea - after the era against which they will begin to serve, Die Zeit said.
F125's frigate was in the heading last year, after German Lynges refused to commission the ship and returned it to a Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to ship builders after it was provided.
The reasons behind the ship's return were not clear, but Germany's media referred to a number of —software and hardware shortages - essentially meant that the warship was good to nothing if she had to fight.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be run by a crew of about 120 forts - only half the numbers on the Bremen class frigates.
Also, it became apparent that the ship over its weight was a bear that worsened its performance and reduced the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
It is believed that the -Rheinland-Palatinate - which is 7,000 tons twice as dryer than similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the lacking hardware, the price for the whole project - including training the crew - begins to be a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from €2.2 billion to start.
The problems of the new frigates become ever more important in considering recent warnings that Germany's worm power decreases.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament’s defence committee acknowledged that the Navy was —a run out of ships that can be found. —
The official said the problem had worsened over time, as old ships had been decommissioned without new ships having been provided in their place.
He stressed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the hidden lives of bats
New research work is being done at a stop in the Scottish Highland which seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The hope is that the findings will throw new light on the behavior of the unique mammals and that it will help with future conservation activities.
The study by the scientists of the Scottish National Trust will follow the least common bats on a minimum soprano bat along with long-lost bats and water bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the site in order to keep track of the activity of the bats throughout the season.
Volunteers and staff of the NHS will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of the recordings will find the frequency of calls of the bats and what species do what.
Then a report and a habitat map will be produced in order to create a detailed landscape size picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the conservation consultant of the nature of the Scottish National Trust, hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important to the bats and how they are used by all species.
The information will help determine the advantages of habitat management work such as the creation of a wolf and how to manage forests for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are under threat by construction and development work that affects their wounds and lead to loss of habitat.
Wind and lightning turbines can also be dangerous, along with paper holding insects and some chemicals in building materials, and attacks by cats.
Pollutants are not blind.
But because they hunt at night their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to holding their food.
They use sophisticated eco-location technique to see insects and obstacles that are ahead of them.
The Scottish National Trust owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and over 76,000 hectares across the country and they are very worried about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who conduct constant surveys, visits to patients and from time to time saves.
The institution has set up Scotland's first hospital guard at Threave stage in Dumfries and Galloway, a home to eighteen Scottish bats species.
State manager David Thompson said that the grounding of the stop was perfect for them.
Here in Threave we have a great area for bats, - he said.
We have many old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there's a lot that we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and at other sites will help us understand more about what we need for a man to be able to thrive.
He emphasized searching for bats before doing any maintenance work in buildings as the destruction of one maternity net could kill up to 400 female and young bats, killing all the local population possible.
Bats are secured and it is illegal to kill, evacuate or defeat on them or destroy their wounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's Army Conservation Trust officer, has been encouraging the public to give hand help.
He said: —We have a great deal to learn about our hysteria and with many of our species we don't know if their populations do well or not.
Ronaldo dismisses allegations of violence as his lawyers prepare to pursue a magazine of Germany.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the accusations of violence against him in —failty news, — saying that people — want to promote themselves - using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to pursue the news magazine of Germany Der Spiegel, which has published the claims.
Portugal's frontman and Juventus have been accused of treating an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a room in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
In, it is claimed that he had paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking of a video of Instagram Live to its 142 million followers hours after the claims were made public, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports a —false news. ·
No, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news - his player, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, told the camera.
- They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is right, - the player added by weaving.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to pursue Der Spiegel due to the claims, claims they have called in —an indecent expression of doubts in a private matter, — according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for —a moral fraud of sum corresponding to the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious crimes in relation to personal rights in the last few years.
The claimed event is said to take place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayoga are claimed to return to the player's room, where she allegedly tried it, according to the papers that were presented with Clarkshire County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the claimed event and tells her that he was —99 percent a can’t.
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that he was ally.
Mayorga claims she approached the police and that pictures were drawn from her injuries at the hospital, but later she agreed to an arrangement outside the court because she was —a disappointing fear-and that she was worried about —get her humiliated public. ·
The 34-year-old woman said she tried to reverse the arrangement as she continued to be harmed by the claimed incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from United Manchester when the claimed attack occurred, and this summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK would regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The UK would-be regretted for the ever-to-be, if he lost his status as world leader in terms of car production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
She added that she was —briddened — that Toyota UK had told the BBC that they would stop producing temporary cars at her factory in Burnaston near Derby if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
- We need an agreement, - Mr Clarke said.
The car manufacturer from Japan said that delays on the border could lead to the loss of jobs if Brexit had no agreement.
The factory produced at Burnaston - which built Toyota Auris and Avensis - nearly 150,000 cars last year and nearly 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
—In my opinion that if Britain fell out of the EU at the end of March construction would stop at our factory, — said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised concerns about the effect that leaving the EU without an agreement will have on trade across the border, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said they will close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what the car manufacturers say are risks in the supply chain if Brexit had no agreement.
Toyota's production line is run on the basis of —only in time, - with pieces arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars that are built on orders.
If the UK would leave the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be problems on the border, problems the industry says would lead to delays and lack of pieces.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than two days of stock at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so it would have to put an end to the construction.
Mr Clarke said Chequers Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU — has been carefully drawn up to avoid those inspections on the border.
We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity, — he told Today’s programme on Radio 4.
The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with a series of delivery chains that have been very successful. ·
Toyota was unable to tell about how long the work of production would end, but in the long term, warned that additional costs would affect the factory's ability to compete and that it would eventually lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a Unite union assembly at the factory, said that his members are increasingly anxious: —From my experience to once these jobs have gone they don't come back.
A spokesperson on behalf of the government said: —We have proposed a detailed and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future.
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again, said the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the provincial waterfall delegate Rod Rosenstein could be swollen for another week - as the struggle over the nomination for the court's granddaughter Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsellor Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference by Russia in the election, links between Trump and Russia's assistants and blocking possible justice by the president.
Whether Trump will dismantle the countrywide summit delegation, and by then the danger of Mueller's independence, has been as on Washington's tongue for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a device to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of removing the scene by using the 25th improvement.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, as he mentioned that he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that it would —well by him not â â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
On Friday, Trump issued a week-long investigation by the FBI into the claims against Kavanaugh, delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Here he said about the meeting with Rosenstein: —No date has been fixed for that yet, it could be this week. I can see that is postponed for another week because of all the other things that happen in the courtroom.
But we can see and I always like to give the press the latest information.”
Some commentators would suspect that claim: Sanders has not held a brief to the press in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace missed why.
Sanders said that the reason for the lack of briefing was not an unhoffter toward —orchestostling - television journalists, though he said: ·I don't disagree with the fact that they overcome it. ·
Then he suggested that the direct link between Trump and the press would increase.
The president is doing more Question and Answer sessions than any previous president, - he said, adding without quoting any evidence: —We have looked at those numbers.
Sanders said that briefing would continue, but —if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the U.S. president, that's much better than talking with me.
We’re trying to do so often and you’ve seen us doing a lot of that during the last few weeks. This will happen in place of holding a brief to the press where you can speak to the US president. ·
Trump often receives questions when leaving the White House or when he participates in open sessions or conferences to the press with visiting issues.
Individual conventions to the press are rare.
In New York this week, the scene showed why, when making a bitaro and odd appearance at moments in front of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at Scottish NHS concerns about Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express their appreciation in the country by wishing them to stay there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay for application costs for the status of a stable resident to EU citizens working for the declared public services.
In his letter, Ms Freeman wrote: —During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on leave have continued, and it is expected that there will be decisions in the autumn.
But the UK government has also been intense preparations for the possibility of ‘no agreement' situation.
Make sure this time of being an unstable one for all of you.
That's why I want to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, no matter what their nationality is.
Co-workers across the EU and beyond bring together valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and give benefit to the patients and communities we serve.
Make sure Scotland is your home and our very desire is to stay here. ·
Christion Jerome gets urgent surgery after having an injury to his head
The linebacker Christion Jerome who plays for the Tennessee State Degrod has had a urgent turnover after suffering an injury to his head as the team lost against Vanderbilt's Comodors from 31 points to 27 Saturday, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessee team.
Tennessee State's chief coach, Rod Rees told reporters that the injury occurred toc before half time.

Trainees and medical personnel brought oxygen to Jerome on the sideline before placing it on a stressier and escorting him back for further assessment.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Jerome had come from the surgery at Vanderbilt's medical center.
Harris added that there was no —any details on the type of injury or how bad the victim is yet to be injured - and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Jerome, who is a second year red shirt student, is in his first term with the State of Tennessee after he was transferred from Illinois.

Buyers from abroad will have to pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK.
Buyers from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK, and the additional money will be used to provide assistance to the homeless under new plans from the Tories.
This proposal will neutralize Corbyn's campaign success to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp tax will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year- to assist the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that buyers from abroad have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK - and the additional money will be used to give assistance to the homeless.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's campaign success to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable houses and target those who earn great wages.
The increase in stamp tax will be put on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK. The additional money will promote the Government’s intention to address people sleeping out.
The overpayment- which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels presented two years ago on second homes and buy-in-set houses - may be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects this proposal to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is thought that 13 percent of brand new property in London is purchased by residents from outside the UK, and this increases the prices and makes it difficult for first time buyers to step on the housing school.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital- have turned into —uninhabited towns - because so many buyers of abroad spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for cutting the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and insisted on Mrs May to stop quotas on affordable houses to fix the —houses gap — in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has published an impressive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent management and ending the turning of people from their homes —without-fai.
He also wants to give more power to proposals to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year, I said that I would commit my work as prime minister to restore the British dream - that life would improve to every new generation.
And that means repairing our defensive housing market.
Britain will always open its doors to people who want to live, work and create a life here. —
However, it cannot be right that buying houses is the same as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, as it is for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of owning a house is far from being within their reach, and the amarch of sleeping out on the street continues to be much too real. ·
Jack Ross: —My ambition eventually is to manage Scotland. ·
Sunderland's manager Jack Ross says that his —highleigence is ultimately a Scottish team manager.
The Scotsman, aged 42, admonishes for the challenge of relegation of the North-West club, who is currently in the third position in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren's lead back to the Scottish Supreme Court last season.
—I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that’s it,” Ross told Sportsound, the Scottish BBC programme.
—When I was a child, I was raised watching Scotland in Hampden quite a bit with my father, and it's something that's been neated back ever.
That opportunity will only come to my part, if I successfully manage a club. ·
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletics manager says he had no fear of drinking such names firmly in such a big club, and has previously rejected motions by Barnsley and Ipswich.
A success for me at the moment will see ‘which I can lead this club back to the Supreme Court’.
Due to the structure and facilities of the club, it belongs to the Supreme Court without or unless, seduction.
It is not easy to get the club there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself successful unless we could get the club back there.
Only three years since Ross started his career as a manager, he had a period as a deputy director in Dumbarton and a 15-month period as one of Hearts training staff.
He then helped raise Alloa after they fell to the third layer, and transformed St Mirren from them falling layer to be at the top of the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he felt more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
—It's likely that it's a bit of a tyrannical point, - he said when he remembered about taking the lead in Alloa.
—I was really believing that being a manager was the very career for me, more so than being a player.
It sounds odd because I did it right, I did a reasonable lifestyle of it, and I got a few to a peak.
But play can be hard.
There are many things to do weekly.
I'm still going through that in terms of the stress and work pressure but management feels right.
I always wanted to be a manager and as I had realized that, I now feel more satisfied with my world than ever. —

The perfect time for a pint is 5.30 on Saturday evening, according to a survey.
The hot weather in the summer has given a boost to British pub earnings that find it difficult, but it has put more pressure on restaurants to eat.
Bar groups and pubs saw an increase of 2.7 percent in sales in July - but a fall of 4.8 percent was seen in the earnings of restaurants eating, according to figures.
Peter Martin of CGA's business consultancy company said that the figures gathered: —Because the hot weather had continued, and that England had stayed in the World Cup longer than expected, a pattern similar to June that was in July, where pubs saw an increase of 2.8 percent, but that the eating houses had suffered more ever.
After the fall of 1.8 percent in dining houses trade in June, things went from bad to worse in July.
Pubs and bars that sold drinks performed best by seeing more progress than he saw houses eating of loss.
Pubs that focus on selling food due to the sun also suffered, though not as much as people running restaurants were eating.
It seems that going out for a drink only people wanted to do.
Across the tariffs and bars that are managed, there was an increase of 6.6 percent in drink sales for the month, while there was a fall of three percent in food. £
Paul Newman of a leisure analysis and hospitality company RSM said: ·These results show a continuation in the bias we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and effect of major social events or in the world of sport continue to be major factors in terms of sales in the market outside of the home.
It is not surprising that eating housing groups are still suffering, although a fall of 4.8 percent a year after a year will certainly be painful as well as ongoing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at worse time for people who run eating houses that focus on selling food, and time and tenses whether a more moderate temperatures August will give some real rest that is needed. ·
In July, there was an increase of 2.7 percent in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones. This reflected the slowdown that resulted in the introduction of new brands.
The sales monitor The Coffer Peach Tracker for the pubs and restaurants in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups. They have a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and are the industry’s established benchmark.

One of all five children - some as young as 11 years old - create social media accounts they hide from adults.
An overview of 20,000 high school students has shown a rapid progress in accounts--Insta fake---which refers to Instagram's photo sharing site.
The news has intensed the concerns that content of sexual nature is posted.
Twenty-five percent of students said they have —principles — a suitable account to show to parents, while they also have private ones.
One mother encountered the hidden position of her 13-year-old daughter and saw a teenager encouraging others to —dream me. —
The research work, by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Principals (HMC) independent schools, has found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: —It is a concern that so many children in their teens are tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers can't find them.
Doyle will be the voice of athletes on board Scottish Athletics.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to be on board Scottish Athletics as an inactive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie described the decision chairman as a great opportunity for those leading the team to gain benefit from the wide range of experiences she has at international level over the last decade.
A great respect for Eilidh across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from its acquisition on the board, — Beattie said.
Doyle said: ‘I am eager to be a voice to athletes and hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.’

There is an online opinion variety about an almost pump advertisement that compares mothers with cattle
Online opinion diversity is an advertising skills by an almost pump company that compares mothers who feed cattle being stolen.
To indicate the launch of what is known as a —a first almost silent pump in the world that can be first worn, » the Elvie technical goods company has released a cell phone advertisement in the form of a musical video to show the freedom the new pump gives it to mothers who are stolen the breast.
There are four real mothers dancing in a grass buds and cows in it, to a track containing words like: -Yes, I'm gouring myself, but you don't see a tail-and-responsive that you didn't notice, these are not pyrs, but breasts. ·
The kite is in front of him: —Pumping out, pumping out, I feed the babis, pumping out, pumping out, I'm gouring the bubis.
However, the advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has been the subject of an online burn.
With 77,000 people having seen the video and hundreds given comments, it has received a mixed response among spectators, with some saying that it doesn't convey —erhyltra - the milk industry seriously.
A very bad decision when using cows to advertise this product. ·
As if they need pregnancy and give birth to produce milk, but their babis are brought off of them within days of giving birth, — one wrote.
Elvie's almost pump fits ideally and from the view inside a nursing fra (Elvie/Mam)
Another one said: —It is understandable that this is traumatic to the mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a pump almost to mothers who are keeping their babysitters swirl swirl swirl swirl swirls swirls swirls swirls swirls swirls swirls swirls swirls swir
Someone else added: —An advertisement that doesn't understand the world from which it is.
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she saw the song in —didn't over. —
This is a great idea.
I would have had one if I still fed from the breast.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The announcement is somewhat hurt but I took it for what was from.
This is a great product, · one wrote
Another one said: —This is a fun full advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or dollies) and feel like —warranty.
Neither praise nor criticise the milk industry the advertisement is.
At the end of the video the group of women revealed that they had been dancing with the pumps hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign has been based on the belief that many women who pump from the breast feel like cows.
However, Elvie pump is completely silent, does not have wires or tubes and it fits ideally inside a nursing fra. This gives women the freedom to move, to tackle in their babis, and even get out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Director of Mother's Creatives, said: —Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product until it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
When showing similarity between the taking of the breast and the cattle we wanted to draw attention to the pumps of the breast and all its challenges, showing the uncircumcised freedom that comes from the new pump in an entertaining and pervasive way.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has reached the front pages.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother appeared to two children on stage to the planner Marta Jakubowski while he was using the product.
Hundreds of Children Mudly Moved to Wrexham on the Texas Border
The number of vulnerable children who are kept from fleeing has increased sharply although the numbers crossing the border each month have not changed much. This is partly because rhetoric and strict policies presented by the Trump administration make it difficult to lay children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been entrepreneurs themselves without a right to be in the country, and they have been worried about risking their right to stay in the country when stepping forward to permit a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the provision of sponsors and other adults in the house would have to give fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior executive of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before the Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor children under the age of without a company.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
· Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or members of the same house as sponsors, reside in the country illegally, and a large number of those are foreign criminals.
So we continue to go after those individuals, - Mr Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was previously normal, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear through a video-conference call, rather than personally, in order to plead their guilty for legal status in front of an immigration judge.
Those considered eligible for help will be sent from the country homeless.
According to refugee workers and reports that have appeared from the system during the last few months, the longer children will remain in the blind the more likely it is for them to feel anxious or low spirit. This can lead to violent pills or trying to escape.
Journalists say that such concerns are worse in a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering can be ignored, because of his size.
It was added that moving children to the tent city without giving them sufficient time to prepare emotionally or farewell with friends can worsen the trauma many struggle against.
Syria says ‘powers that have occupied' from the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
At the inauguration of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in the country was in its twelfth year now.
Moualem, who is also a prime minister's delegate, said that the foreign forces on Syria's land were illegal, pretended to fight terrorism, and they'd be —deceased with them appropriately.
- They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions, - he told the assembly.
Moualem demanded that —the war against terrorism is almost on top of - in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more than millions detonated from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to —morrow this sacred battle until we've got to clean up all Syria's territories - from both terrorist groups and —any illegal foreign presence. ·
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and consulting Kurdish and Arab forces from Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers footing the country destroyed by war.
When discussing refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances were right for them to return, and he gave a fault on —some of the western countries--for —the spread of irresponsible fears--which encouraged refugees to keep track.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian institutions to facilitate the process for them to return, - he said.
—They have made a completely humanitarian matter. ·
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria until there will be a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a earmarking domain in the last important polity of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to forward political discussions.
In the wake of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, it was succeeded to avoid a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.

Why Trump Will Win Second Term
From accepting that, Mr. Trump could be fired in 2020 unless, as many of the freedmen hope it is certain that, that high-profile and scandal will soon end his presidency.
And that would, without doubt, be the most dramatic endowment to ever-expanding scenery.
Currently, there are no signs that the spectators have tired.
Since 2014, peak hours figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million peak hours viewers, who have increased from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and a program »The Rachel Maddow Show » has surpassed the cable television viewing figures with as much as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
- This is a text that attracts people because we don't understand it, - said Neal Baer, the program runner of the ABC-Designated Survivor drama, severed with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the capital.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author -Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She recalled a trip in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote over Mr. Trump.
Why? asked her.
“He said of me,” “For he made me laugh,” Ms. Scovell told me.
Entertainment is in the middle of the unrest.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington may decide the future of Roe v. Wade, which can bring families who have infuriated back together, and the state of the global economy.
Only the most privileged spectators have the ability to turn off the television.
And yet, it goes no longer than to be an informed citizen when you realize that you are on the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts argue regarding Bob Woodward's use of the words - an intense plot swipe swipe swipe for his book -Fear, - a $15,000 short of estranged Paul Manafort's skin jacket swipe swipe with too much pride, swipe back the Washington Post) and the swivelling descriptions of Stormy Daniels's, in, anatomy Mr. Trump.
I personally would not be able to look at Super Mario in the same way ever again.
—Part of what makes you feel that it's like a reality program is that it feeds you with something every night, — said Brent Montgomery, chief operator of Wheelhouse Entertainment and a creator -Pawn Stars — about Trump's programme characters being circulated and the daily turn in the tail of the stories (warming the N.F.L, Kim Jong-un's praise).
You cannot afford to fail one chapter or you will be left behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees outside his home on Kauai's northern beach, but he had swam inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not leave the screen, not Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the spot.
—I remember when we did all the mad programs then since a lot and people say,  »This is the end to the warship of the West, » Mr. Fleiss told me.
—I thought it was some sort of joke of, but the true one is that they were right. ·

Outside money flows into the mid-term electoral races in the House
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania district received a flow of money, thanks to the reshaped of congressional districts which means that there are two holders in the race for the same seat.
The Pittsburg municipal district recently re-designated favors Conor Lamb who is a Democrat - who won his seat in another district in the spring special election last year.
Lamb runs against another deputy, who is Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which overlaps somewhat with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania declared in January that the old districts were unconformably unfair in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a campaigning struggle between the primary ballot funding branches, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania having a close victory in a contest that gained much attention in March in a special election to Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
Republicans had held hold in the seat for over a decade, and President Trump won the district of 20 points.
The political pundits say that the Democrats are on the front.
U.D. presides over El Salvador's punishment over giving support to China, then withdraws
Diplomats said that both the Dominican Republic and Phanama had already recognized Beijing, without much unfavorable response from Washington.
Mr. Trump got a heat meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Banama in June 2017. He had a hotel in Panama until partners turned the Trump Foundation's management team out.
State Department officials decided to call the heads of diplomatic mission back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Phanama due to the —late decisions to reject Taiwan's recognitions, — Heather Nauert, a spokesperson on behalf of the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
Pensions were only considered against El Salvador, who received approximately $140 million in aid from America in 2017, which included drug management, economic assistance and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions targeted, would have been painful to the country in Central America and its high rate of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings moved forward, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention aimed at security and economic prosperity to go on a similar meeting trail that was held last year which was considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent demonstrators from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior executive officials explained that they wanted the convention to go ahead, and thus put an end to any consideration to El Salvador's punishment.
The diplomats said that Vice President Mike Pence was earmarked to address the convention, which has been scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration puts on the meeting.
And the three messengers from America returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no difficult new messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson from the White House on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to give details of the issue described by the three officers of America, who included two diplomats who agreed to talk about the internal discussions on the condition that they were unknown.
The reports were confirmed by an outsider who is close to the administration he also spoke on the condition that he was of our unknown nature.
Study History
The next major incident may be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on the possibility that Mr. Trump has prevented justice, where there is now significant evidence in public records.
According to each mention Mr. Mueller also in his report discusses whether Mr. Trump's campaign did assembly with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to face responsibility to that body, and are preparing to go before voters again, and perhaps a jury of his peers in the long and late end.
A lot of uncertainty belongs to that, and I don't suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is annoyed- or his colleagues in Europe.
Options need to be made by each of us on either side of the Atlantic which will have an effect along the efforts.
In 1938 German officials were ready to conduct a coup d’état against Hitler, if the west but had resisted and supported the Czechoslofacts in Munich.
We failed, and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of stage that existed.
The course of history turns around such formation points, and the unsolved journey of democracy is conceded or honed.
Americans face many of these formation points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump dismisses the Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the husband who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation's faculty?
Rosenstein has been in depths waters ever since this paper reported last year, that he had suggested recording the scene secretly and theory that it was unresponsive to the job.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times report is incorrect.
—How will we respond if the investigation the F.B.I has not just asked for to Brett Kavanaugh is full nor fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite claims of a credible sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
In no breath, will we vote in the mid-term elections of Congress party that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, it will be difficult on democracy.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
A Jew of Czechoslovakia was my mother who was exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi organization who at one time occupied my courthouse.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table that showed the swastica.
And that's part of my heritage, how can I not be hopeful about the future?

Graham Dorans of the Rangers team is confident before playing against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians, following the equal game in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will mean they are in a good position to apply from the European League Group G.
An injury to his knee meant that Graham Dorans could not play this season until the 2-2 match with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result to accomplish great things.
—It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team, - the 31-year-old player said.
We started the game thinking we could have something we came from there with a point.
We might have finally beaten but, on the whole, an equal game was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
As of Thursday night, she is another great European night.
I hope we could have three points but that will be difficult because they got a good result in their last game. But, with the crowd supporting us, I am sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
The last year was definitely challenging, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made in the club itself, but there is a nice feeling in place now.
The garage is good and the boys enjoy it terrible; the exercises are good.
I hope we can hold on to it now, forgeting about the last and successful season.
Women lose sleep due to this fear of retirement savings
Although the fact that those who took part in the survey had a good idea of the way they wanted to have care, only a few people were talking about that with family members.
About half of the individuals in a Nationwide study said they spoke to their married about the cost of long term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about that.
- People wanting a family member to care for them, but they don't take the steps to get that conversation, - Holly Snyder, the vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business, said.
This is where there is a start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't report your wishes far in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how receiving care, because those options can be important factors in determining the cost.
You should include your financial adviser: Your participant can help you think about a way to pay those costs too.
Your options for long term care funding may include traditional long term care insurance policy, hybrid value-fund life insurance policy in order to pay for those costs or self-check your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Develop your legal documents: Prevent legal struggles.
Make sure you have health care brokers so that you specify an individual you trust to oversee your medical care to make sure that professional employees comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, you should consider attorneyship for your financial affairs.
You would choose an individual you trust to make your financial decisions for you and to make sure your bills are paid if you are able to do so.
Don't forget the details minor: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and that he is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
It involves more than financial issues, who the doctors are - Martin asked.
—What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Draw out that plan. —

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and a tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to officials, with the number of deaths likely to rise.
With links having been cut, rescue officers have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggala Prefecture, an area in northern Palu that is closer to the summit of the magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have had to mud after the earthquake struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi island:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population goal of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40-year-old birthday when it struck the earthquake and tsunami.

Federal prosecutors call for the quite punishment for the man who is under suspicion of conducting the embarrassing attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the pretty punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the several who are under suspicion for the embarrassing attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been given in the province for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is accused of using a rental truck by Home Depot to attack a bike route along the Western Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting the pedestrians and bikers who were in his way in October.
In order to justify the punishment quite, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has killed the eight individuals in —fluential severance- and has caused serious physical injuries in —fluential severance--according to the warning of intent to seek the extreme punishment, which is filed in New York's Southern Area.
Those two courts are able to give the punishment quite, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury accused Saipov with entitled 22 charges that included eight charges of murder in order to deceive, charges which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crimes, and an offence of violence and destruction to motor vehicles.
The prosecutors said that the attack was a requirement for a significant —prevention and planning of a significant succinctly succinctly - describing Saipov's attack as one succinct, cruel and corrupt. ·
—Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, said the warning of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern Area of New York introduced the punishment quite.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was immediately sentenced to imprisonment for life in September 2009.
The last time the quite punishment was given in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both of them were put to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who hailed from Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what had been done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to conduct the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the statement.
He also asked for an ISIS flag in his room in the hospital, police said.
He has pleaded innocent to the indictment containing 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the defenders who represented Saipov, said that they were — prominently disappointing — with the decision of the successor.
—We believe that the decision to seek the punishment is quite rather than receiving guilty plea to life in prison without a possibility of being released making only the trauma stretch of these events to everyone who is related,   » said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had already asked the prosecutors for not trying the punishment quite.
AS Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit discussions
Nigel Farage promised to ‘action on the voice of the people' today during a protest at the Dormitory convention.
Former UKIP leader said politicians must ‘demonstrate the pressure' by European members - as did one of Theresa May's own MPs who should be responsible for discussions with the EU.
In the march in Birmingham, Peter Bone, one of the Allied members of the back benches, said that the UK would ‘be gone out' now if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces when recombining her extremely divided roles is based on Dories who are of party Aros joining another protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to maintain an order on his Chequers plan in the midst of attacks by people who are from Brexit party, people who are from the Aros and European Union.
Prosecutors have demanded that she still try to hit a deal with Brussels despite worse the echo - forcing European members and Labour members to choose between her package and ‘ann'.
Mr Bone at the rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull said he wanted to ‘take Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have made him a lord and given him the responsibility for discussions with Brussels.
‘If he had been responsible, we would have gone out now,' he said.
AS Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand from Brexit party, but we must get rid of Chequers.'
Describing his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We did not fight in world wars to be secondary.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone dismissed suggestions that indicated that the public's opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain completely wrong.'
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory member of Brexit party, was also in the march and told reporters: ‘I say: President, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are not popular among the public, the Opposition is not going to vote from the party of the plan, it is promising among our party and our active members who walk the streets in order to educate us in the first place.
Don't hit on with Chequers and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs. May, he added: ‘Chief ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must ‘demonstrate the pressure' if they wanted to fraternize the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
‘Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
‘They try to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them ‘we don't let you do that'.'
In a message to the proud crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel that pressure.
‘We act on the voice of the people of the country who made sure victory for us in terms of Brexit and we will continue until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, people who are from Aros across Birmingham marched before conducting a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tories flags at By Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
One of Labour's lords, Lord Adoins, made fun of the Conservatives' head because of the security issues they received with the party's app as the convention opened.
‘We are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for the Canadian bargain plus, for difficult borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he said.
‘It's a complete fence.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit,' he said.
Warren is serious about applying for the post of president
Elizabeth Warren, one of the U.S. Senators says that she will —see in detail an attempt to be a president - after the November elections.
The Boston Globe says the Democrat from Massachusetts has spoken about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticised Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a provincial Representative on behalf of the GOP, who co-chaired the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
There has been quite a guess that she could compete against Trump in 2020.
In the event at Holyoke Saturday afternoon, she met with electors for the 36th time using the town hall format since Trump took up his position.
Someone who was present asked whether she intended to stand for the president's position.
Warren said that it's time —for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top. -

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after the team order helped him win the front on Sebastian Vettel
It became clear after Valtteri Bottas applied before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's order - would play a major part in the race.
From the post, Bottas got a good start and almost left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two threads and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went to the first pit by letting Hamilton reach the traffic at the end of the pack, something that should have been humanitarian.
The Mercedes went to the lap pit later by coming out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after coming to himself who saw the Ferrari driver, uninhabited, leaving inside loose in danger of holding to go after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the back row of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he held on in his debut to try to finish quickly and pass to Kimi Raikkonen to secure the fourth position.
Finally he came to the holes on lap 44 but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen came to fourth position.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has made great through the weekend and was a noble husband letting me pass.
The team has done a great job to get one two, - Hamilton said.
That's a Very Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein's head at a rally on Saturday because she did not share the letter with Christine Blasey Ford accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
As he spoke at a rally in Northern Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the evidence that Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead he said that what goes on in Parliament shows that people are —gas and evil and an enemy.”
The same thing that could happen and the blessed thing that has been going on during the last few days in Parliament, when you see the anger, when you see people who are hateful and evil and enemyless, is swollen.
—When you look at statements and the documents that are shared and then they are saying swivelly, I didn't make it.
No I did. —
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you share the letter?
Remember her answer... did you share the document--o, o, what?
Oh, nad.
I am not able to share the document.
Well, wait a minute.
We did not share the document...Naddo, we did not do it, — it added, watwar the senator.
Feinstein got the letter containing the details of the claims against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and was shared beginning September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had been shared by a member of his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t share his story,” Feinstein told the committee, saying The Hill.
He asked me to keep the letter secret and I did that as she had asked. ·
But it didn't seem that the president believed it, and he made a comment during the Saturday night rally: —I told you something, the language of her body was very bad.
She may not have done it, but that's the worse body language for me to ever see it. -
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's reputation, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the claims to their own relatives.
—They are determined to take the power back by any way necessary.
You see the hatred, the malaise, they don't worry who they are, who they have to slay on them to have power and control, - the president said according to Meditate.

Air Traffic Manager Dead to Ensure Can Hundreds On Aeroplane Dive For Earthquake
Air traffic controller in Indonesia is called a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people rises off the ground safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong backs still hit the area and many stuck in a rubble in the city of Palu.
But although his co-workers had fled for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old boy, refused to leave his work in the extremely silted control tower in the Palu airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained there to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321 aircraft, which was on the runway at the time, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he believed he was falling.
He later died at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesperson on behalf of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that the decision had saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia said.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be transported to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost it this morning before the hostage arrived at Palu.
·The hearing of the news is dorcalonnus, - he said.
Meanwhile, the authorities are worried that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the disaster evacuation agency saying that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
The number is likely to still rise because many bodies are still under the murals and many bodies that we have not yet reached, — a spokesperson on behalf of the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said.
Waves reached six meters have crashed Palu, who will conduct a crowded funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: —Ambulance brings bodies here every minute.
Clean water is rare.
People steal from the little arches everywhere. £
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: —The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
The situation is already a disaster, but it could go a lot worse. -
Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: —I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the movement and landing.
Are you ready - CNN said.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok which caused 550 deaths.
Aircraft collapses in Liberia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a plane fell in a lagoon
The aircraft company that was flying a plane that fell to a lagoon in the Pacific in Montenegro now says that one man was missing, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew all managed to leave the plane that was sunk.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not seen one man who was traveling on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airport company said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline company did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, like its age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land in the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials say seven people have been transported to a hospital on Friday.
The airline company said that six people are still in hospital on Saturday, and that all of them are in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident and how exactly it happened.
The U.S. aircraft and Naval company have said that the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane had gone over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane had flown into very low.
— That's a very good thing, - Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other people had been able to walk through water to their center to the emergency outages of the plane that was sunk.
He said that the aircraft's staff were engaged and shouted, and that he had a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors were working to improve quays nearby and that they had helped save people by using a wind boat to transport people to shore before the plane sunk in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aircraft Safety Network shows that 111 people died in aircraft accidents registered with PNG in the last two decades but none of those included Air Niugini.
Analyst presents a schedule the night that a woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented his case Saturday when a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi was alive in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used mobile phone records to create a full picture of the 29-year-old defender's movements, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from many mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, going contrary to her previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When he showed the data that his mobile phone with mobile phone Chambers during the time he had said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Stanford.
Sanford testified Saturday saying that he was not in the town that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was —a lie, because my truck was in Nashville. £
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had said that he had known Chambers since about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records showed that only for weeks did they know each other.
Rowlett said that Tellis had deleted text messages, calls and contact information Chambers from her phone sometime after she died.
He did his deletion of his life, suffocate Hale said.
The defender will begin his locked issues on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Nani of New York pursues a couple for his dismissal following a text message silencing silencing silencing silencing silencing silencing silencing silencing silencing silencing silencing
A nani in New York pursues a couple about discrimination against her and dismissed her after she had a text message commemorating by the mother complaining that she was —another black erson. —
The couple deny that they are racial, saying that the situation is as if someone was —trying to benefit. —
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed when he saw that the childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
—NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DU ARALL. — Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After commenting on her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt she was —announcer - dismissed Ms. Maurice, saying that their old nani, who was an African-American, had done terrible work and that she was rather expecting Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for his day of work and was then sent home in Uber.
Now, Maurice pursues the couple for compensation because she was dismissed, and she tries to get compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work with accommodation she had been hired to do to begin, though without a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do things like that,” he said to the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is a case of discrimination.
The couple have criticized the claims that they are racial, saying that bringing Maurice's employment to an end was the reasonable thing to do, as they are worried that they could not trust him after his resignation.
—My wife did send something to her that she didn't think she said.
She is not racial.
We're not racially ill, — Mr Joel Plasco told the Post.
—But would you put your children in charge of someone you've been inaudible with, even if that was a mistake?
Your new born baby?
I don't think. —

Paddington publishers fear that readers would not agree with a speaking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said about the letter: —It's hard to step up to someone's shoes that read it for the first time before it was published.
Now, it's very entertaining to know what we know about Paddington's thriving success. ·
She said that her father, who had been working as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a little bearer, would have received the thing if his work had been rejected, but added that celebrating 60 years since the publishing of the books was a feeling —a sweet bitterness — after his death last year.
She said that her father was proud of Paddington's subsequent success in a small calm, describing the bear as —a very important member of the family's sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing sneezing
—He was a pretty quiet man, and he was not an inflexible man, — he said.
—But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you're proud of the child though you're not really responsible for his success.
I think he considered Paddington's success in that way.
Although his creation and imagination he was the work, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself. -
My daughter was dead and I had to tell a farewell to her over the phone
After her landing, her daughter was rushed to the Loius Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
—Nad was regularly phoning to say that things were very bad, and that she didn't expect to come through, — Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
—Then I got the call from Nad saying that she was going to die during the next two minutes and that I had to tell a farewell to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with thee.
The drugs in which she had been obtained by the doctors to keep her heart knocked were beginning to end and leave her system.
She had died a little before and now everything was shut down.
I had to sit there and stay, knowing that all this happened.
I could not naive or shout or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be brave. —
In the long and late Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning for losing her daughter, got on the plane alongside the other passengers - who were unaware of her experience.
“No one knew,” he said.
I kept my head down, and the tears fell all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but on the plane the feeling of the lateral sense of sympathy to Nad.
He needed my love and my nervousness.
I knew so much that he loved her. —
Women in disease post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost victims due to suicide, work to prevent other people from putting an end to their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspired messages and telephone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Ms Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
- I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day, - he said.
Ms Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was an additive cooker and that he had a heinous smile.
—Everybody remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit any room. —
However, he gave up his work before he died because he was —in a very dark place. —
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: —I always worry that that's about having an effect again then. —
Ms Davis rendered the cards, —to let people know that there are people who can get to them and talk to them, even if they are a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you have to speak.--
Ms Humphreys has been friends with Ms Davis for years, and she lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after he lost his mother.
—Whether of not saying that he felt sad or low or nothing so, — he said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in its attitude.
He had reached the bottom one Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts he made of nothing to make any eye contact with them or nothing so. —
He said that his death had been a huge blow to them, but that they had to come through it: —He torn a hole through my family.
It breaks us into pieces.
But we all have to carry on and struggle. —

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in the advantage as the FBI begins to investigate
—I thought, if we could have something like it was asking for - a limited investigation in terms of time, limited in scope - maybe we could secure a little unity, — Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was —a crash — in the middle of a police legislative tag.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their availability involves timing.
Only five weeks are to go until the mid-term elections, on November 6 - if, according to the expectation, the Republicans will do poorly, then they will be significantly weakened in terms of their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been raising the phone to phone Senators, pressing on them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was a personal secretary to Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh may have at least 50 votes down the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to come to a decision and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The numbers of North Korean refugees are ‘down' under Kim's leadership
The number of people from North Korea fleeing to South Korea has dropped since Jim Jong-un came into force seven years ago, according to a lawmaker from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the Southern unification administration, said that 1,127 cases of fleeing last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the stricter processes to control borders between North Korea and China and the higher rates at which people smugglers raise them, are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most people fleeing from the North finally have a South Korean citizenship offer.
Seoul said that more than 30,000 people from North Korea had illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is a country to which it is easier to cross than the highly protected Provincial Area between the two Koreans.
China refers to those fleeing as illegal citizens rather than refugees, and she often forced them back to their own country.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is still in war technically - has improved significantly during the last few months.
Earlier in this month, the leaders of the two countries made a meeting in Pyongyang for conversations that focused on the denuclearisation negotiations that had come to an end.
This came following the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had a serious debate about working towards removing nuclear waste in the Korean capital.
But, on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho failed US sanctions for the lack of progress since.
- Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves as a first one-sided one-sided at all, - Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh's —responsible - saying he doesn't fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, Leader of the House Minority, called Brett Kavanaugh an —apparently, saying that he did not fit, due to the nature of his character, to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
—If a woman had behaved like then, I'm sure they would have called him sneezingly-responsively--he said Pelosi in response to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional in denying the claims that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost yelled and tapped by weeping at times when he discussed his family and period at high school.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying that the claims against him were —destroying his reputation in a collective and counter-terrorism way — and that arranged by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's evidence proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because his evidence showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
—I think it shows that it is ineligible with those statements and the way in which Clinton and the Democrats accused supporters, - he said.
Pelosi when asked whether she would try to be confirmed, and whether the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
—I will do to say this -- if it doesn't say the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it doesn't fit to be the Supreme Court nor to be in the court in which it is currently in it, — Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi said she as a Democrat was worried about the possible cases of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a federal judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reverse the Supreme Court's specific decisions.
—This is not the time to have someone irresponsible and prejudiced in court by waiting for us to say, ‘that's great--, Pelosi said.
And Women must Dress the Peth.
It is a righteous conversation, months and years of advance accumulates, and cannot get rid of it without crying.
—We are crying when we're wild,\" Ms. Steinem told me to 45 years later.
I don't think that's uncommon, are you?
She went before him, —I got a lot of help from a woman who was an active officer somewhere, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique and so, when she was wild and started crying, she will tell the person who spoke to her,--You believe my goal was to sad because I was crying.
I'm tired. —
And then she will carry on.
And I thought that's great. -
tears are allowed to give expression to anger partly because they are, basically, misled.
One of the most clear memories I have from an early job, in an office where men were in it most, and I cried by anger beyond words, is an older woman trapped in me to the arts of my neck--a cool ruler who always raised fear on me--and he dragged me to the staircase.
Don't ever let them see you crying,--he told me.
—They don't know you're bydream.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad that they've hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a charity outside a wedding on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled back from the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was very frustrated, realized that there was no reason she should not think of applying for the president's own position.
—I didn't think of the decision right, - he told me by laughing 30 years later.
—There were seven other candidates in the race ready, and the last thing he needed was another.
Someone called us in —Eira Wen and the Seven Corrach,
Because she was late in the campaign, she was behind her in terms of raising money, so she promised she would not participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
She was a battle of vain.
She noticed that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
- They thought I was getting a fallacy - he asked.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, her feelings went too much to her - thanks to the people who had supported it, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than representatives, and anger due to the prejudice on the basis of sex - and began to cry.
—You would think that my nerves had crashed, — Ms. Schroeder said about the way the press responded to her.
—You would have thought that Kleenex was my incorporated marker.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my grave stone?

How the US-China trade war can be from Beijing
The first wave of the trade war between the U.S. and China was enough to deafen someone, and although the battle is not over, a tear between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President, Donald Trump, issued the first warning this year by placing taxes on China's key exports including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
The most significant increase was introduced this week with new tariffs affecting the value of $200 billion (£150 billion) of items, by taxing, for all purposes, half of all goods that come to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has paid the weight back every time and, most recently, has laid tariffs of five to ten percent on $600 billion of America's goods.
China has promised to match US efforts and the largest economy but one world is not likely to surrender soon.
Getting Washington to quit means surrendering to the requirements, but mossing publicly to the U.S. would raise too much revenue on Xi Jinping, China's president.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing can go from its very scope, U.S. trade war pressure could support China in a positive way in the longer term by ensuring that both economies rely less on each other.
—The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that economic panic begins in either country and its other, in fact, is much more dangerous than previously recognized spectators,        « Abigail Grace, a contact investigator who focuses on Asia at the New American Security Centre, who is a discussion mill.
Syria 'go ready' for receiving asylum seekers back, said Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugee seekers voluntarily and it is appealing for help to rebuild the country that has been disrupted by seven years of war.
At the inauguration of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions were improving in the country.
—The situation on downland is now more stable and safe, thanks to the fight against terrorism, - he said.
The government is working hard to renew the areas destroyed by firefighters to restore normality.
The conditions are right now for receiving asylum seekers back to the country after having to flee from terrorism and the harmful economic measures that targeted their vehicular lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people who are still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he emphasized that he would not receive assistance with conditions or help from countries that had supported the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. Team 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The US has lost six times consecutively on European land, and they have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe managed to secure victory as Thomas Bjorn's team, the captain of Denmark, reached the required 14.5 points to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had a difficult tournament, but when he netted the star ball from the U.S. in the water on the 16th hole par-3 he had to surrender the game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the golfer from Italy, had starred in each round, becoming 1 of the 4 players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to their current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was suspended 5&4 by the weakest player on paper in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top selection, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Ian Poulter of England who played probably in his last Ryder Cup.
And he played in his eighth Ryder Cup, Spain's Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful player ever in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
—I'm not one to grieve as usual, but I can't help that today.
She has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for my novelty to and for putting his faith in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that we've got the cup back.
The team that's important, and I'm glad I've been able to help, — Garcia said through his tears after Europe won.
The baton transferred to its fellow John Ram who beat the US golf hero, Tiger Woods, 2&1 in the game to the singles on Sunday.
—I was so pleased to beat Tiger Woods as I had grown up watching him play golf, » said Rahm, a 23-year-old lank.
Woods lost all of his four games in France, meaning that his record was now in the Ryder Cup at 13-21-3.
And that's a strange statistics for one of the best players ever as he has won 14 championships in his career, second behind Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, the U.S. Team had had trouble all the weekend to find the clear way.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, —I'm proud of this bus, they're hard.
We had put pressure on Europe during the morning.
We fought.
Thomas must give credit.
He is an unresponsive captain.
All of his 12 players had played very well.
We fight back. I want to work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup Committee. We have to move on.
I love our 12 players and are proud to be captain of them.
You must lift your cap to them.
They played better than we did. —
