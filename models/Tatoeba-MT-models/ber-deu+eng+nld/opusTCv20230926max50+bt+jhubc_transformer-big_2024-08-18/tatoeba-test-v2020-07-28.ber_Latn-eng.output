It seems you love you.
Most of your men are with you.
I don't think we'll ever be our hero.
How many people do you have?
What did you find out?
What does it mean to be true if a man is willing to do so, but how does it make him feel?
He must stop smoking.
Not all of that.
Make room for your room.
You don't know what time it will be?
They did believe it.
Tom is calling a friend in the phone.
The dress was black.
You've missed out, did you?
Sam took it as well.

This is Tom's game.
Can you send me a message?
He doesn't need to be better than that today, either.
Tom didn't see me, though.

Go back to your country.

Can you open the door, please?
He will answer all questions.

Tell me what you don't believe.
If you were like me, you wouldn't be in trouble.
We're going to kill, aren't we?
What would happen if you didn't have time?
I want to do it, but I don't want to.
