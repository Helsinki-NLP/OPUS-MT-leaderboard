The cells are from Latin "cella", which means "small rooms", but was initially used by a man who uses microscopes to observe the soft wooden structure first.
The cells are the basic units of all creatures, and all the bodies of life are made up of one or more cells.
The cells are so fundamental and important for the study of life, and, in fact, they are often called "the trees of life".
By sending the nerves to the whole body, the neurological system keeps blood flowing and unhindered, so that the body is determined.
These neurotransmitters are transported to every body at a very fast speed to help avoid threats.
The Tornados were less than the other violent storms, but they could destroy everything they had done.
The dragon winds lift the trees up, rip off the wood on the building and throw the car into the air.
The storms of these monsters are at 480 kilometres per hour.
Humans have been producing mirrors for thousands of years and using them to scale up.
But the first real telescope was created in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes use two mirrors to make remote objects look closer and bigger.
We will never escape greedy and selfishness. The nature of our cooperation is that when most people benefit, self-religion will always benefit more in the short term.
I hope most people will finally understand that their best choice for a long time is to work with others.
Many are dreaming that one day human beings can reach another planet and explore other new worlds; some are curious about things outside the solar system; others believe that aliens or other forms of life may exist on another planet.
But if it did happen, it might not happen for a very long time.
Perhaps some day in the future your great grandchildren will be standing in a world of aliens, wondering who their fathers were.
Animals are made up of many cells, and they eat and disappear inside.
Only animals have brains (but not even all animals, for example, a dam has no brain).
They dig holes on the ground, swim in the sea, fly in the air.
The cells are life, with the smallest structure and functional units of the body.
The cella in Latin means small space.
If you watch the creature under the microscope, you'll see that the creature is made up of small diamonds or ballballs.
The British biologist Robert Hook observed the small diamonds of soft wood by microscopes.
They look like a room.
Elements and compounds can move from one state to another, and the nature of the matter does not change.
Nitrogen is still of the same nature as liquid nitrogen under the gas. Although the liquid density is higher, the two molecules form the same.
Water is another example.
There are the same molecular structures, whether gas, liquid or solid.
Although it may change physically, it still remains chemical.
The time is around us and it affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
For thousands of years, religions, philosophy and scientists have been studying time.
We're in the future and now, and we're in the past series of events.
It's time for us to compare the length of events.
This weekly incident is a matter of constant recurrence, which can be marked by the observation of the weekly events.
Now it's using computers to change photos and videos.
We can make complicated Animations with computers, and it's getting more and more often on television and movies.
Music Recording methods, usually processing and mixing with smart computers.
For a long time in the 19th to 20th century, people believed that New Zealand's first residents were Maori, and they would hunt the birds called Fear.
The theory followed by a point of view that Maoris were riding in the big fleet, beginning to move in Polynesia, then taking away New Zealand from the Morio people, and creating a farming society.
However, the new evidence suggests that the Morioris were a Maori group in New Zealand, who moved from New Zealand to the Chatam Islands and developed their own unique culture of peace.
There's another tribe on the Chatam Islands, Maori from New Zealand.
They call themselves the Morioris, and there were small conflicts before, and the Morioris were finally erased.
A decades-long participant could help us to understand our strengths and enthusiasm and to take a frank assessment of our plight and even to fail.
When people share their own stories, families and organizations, we will hear valuable points of view, deeper knowledge of past or negatively affecting the culture of organizations.
Although knowing a person's history doesn't mean knowing culture, it at least makes it clear what they are in the history of the organization.
At the same time, the evaluation of successes and growing awareness of failures, personal and full participation will find the value of the organization, its mission and its drive.
In this situation, recalling past creative practices and successful experiences, it helps people to accept new changes in the local churches and new directions.
This success story can diminish the fear of change, while making it easier to accept future changes.
Consolidating thinking is a solution to the problem by combining different ideas or territories.
The focus of this paradigm is on rapid, logical and preciseness, as well as the identification of facts, the responsibility of existing technologies, the collection of information.
The most important point in this mindset is that there is only one right answer... and only two answers, whether right or wrong.
This way of thinking is related to specific scientific or standard procedures.
The people of these thinking models are logically logic, they can remember the pattern, solve the problem, carry out scientific tests.
Humans are the most capable species that have so far been able to motivate others.
That means that we can successfully predict the feelings, intentions, beliefs, understanding and desires of other humans.
In these capabilities, it's important to understand the intentions of others.
For example, if you see someone breaking the window, you might assume he's stealing a stranger's car.
If he loses his own car key and tries to enter his own car, then he shall be judged differently.
The foundation of MRI is a physical image known as NMR, which is now found in the 1930s by Felix Bloch and Edward Persere.
At the same time, magnetic field and wireless electromagnetic waves will send small wireless signals for atomics.
In 1970, researchers Dr. Raymond Damadiran found the rationale for using magnetic sensitization as a medical tool.
Four years later, it was a patent for the world's first MRI territory.
In 1977, Dr. Damian completed the construction of the first "Sexy" magnetic scanner, which he called was "Not to Behind".
The non-synching exchanges give us time to reflect on how to respond to others.
It allows students to learn according to their own paces and to control the pace of schooling.
And fewer time constraints to make work more active. (Breemer, 1998)
The use of online and global information networks has allowed learners to access information from time to time.

The modern learning methods that will undo the rules, and the virtuousness of learning is not just one.
In fact, there's no good to learn specially.
From our current experience with DIY and information, it's been explained by the teaching-based TV show.
So a lot of people will see themselves in TV shows that we will never be involved or used in procedures or experience, and we will never use that knowledge.
We'll never go to a car, build a fountain in the backyard, visit the ancient heritage or repair the neighbor's house.
Thanks to the submarine light cables and satellite bandwidth that connect to Europe, the Internet on Greenland is very active, and 93% of the population is on the Internet.
The hotel or owner (if living in a residential or private residence) should be able to provide WiFi or online computers, and all communities have netcats or parts of WiFi's location.
As mentioned above, although the United States can still accept the word "Eskimo", many people of the African North Pole, especially Canadians, are treated as hypocrites.
Even though you may have heard the word the natives of Greenland use it, the foreigners should avoid it.
In Canada, the Greenland indigenous people call themselves Inuit, and in Greenland they call themselves "Kalaalleq."
I don't know what's going on in Greenland, not even in a paradise.
The only one who's not ready is truly in danger, maybe it's just cold weather.
If you visit Greenland in the cold season, you must carry warmer clothes.

But it's because the water is too big to see the fall itself, and it's covered by a lot of water!
The grave of Tutancamen (KV62), perhaps the most famous grave in the valley, is the scene found by Howard Carter in 1922 - where young kings buried, almost nothing damaged.
The small and short Tutancamen cemetery is almost unworthy than most of them.
If anyone wanted to see the damage caused by the attempt to remove mummy out of the coffin, they would only lose their hope, because they could only see the head and shoulders of mummy.
All kinds of enchanted wealth in the cemetery are no longer in the cemetery, but moved to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
