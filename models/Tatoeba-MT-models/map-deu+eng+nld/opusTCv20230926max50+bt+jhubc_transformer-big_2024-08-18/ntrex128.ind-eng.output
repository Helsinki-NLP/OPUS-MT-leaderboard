Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) worried if they ‘look like puppets'.
There were concerns among some AMs against a suggestion that their designation should have been changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/Member of Welsh Parliament).
This arose due to a plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The AM across the political spectrum is concerned if it can invite ridicule.
An AM labour party said that his group was concerned, "The designation was senada with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirt.
An assembly member (AM) said that his group as a single unit, felt "unhappy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but judged that this was a smuggling of the MWP's abbreviation to Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced like a u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which currently drafts legislation to introduce the change of the name, said: "The final decision on any explanation of the designation for the AM is certainly a problem for the members themselves."
The 2017 Wales Government's decision authorized the Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on a proposal known to gain broad support to call the assembly a Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the issue of the designation of the AM, the Commission preferred WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Welsh Members), but the MWP option gained the most support on public consultations.
The AM appeared to propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach the consensus could undermine the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill in a few weeks.
This reform law will include changes—other changes about how the assembly works, including disqualification rules for the AM and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
The Macedonian people went to vote on a referendum on change of country name
Voting owners will determine the choice of whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonian Republic."
The most famous vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbouring country shows a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected EU and NATO membership offers.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, a voter opposition to name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the change of the name was a price that must be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St.Martin's bells are not tinged when churches in Harlem are in trouble
“Historically, the parents I spoke to say there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” said Mr. Adam.
"Today, there's not one."
He said that the disappearance of all these bars could be realized.
"People socialize in other ways" now, he says.
"Bar is no longer the living room of the surrounding community where people visit it regularly."
Similarly to the church, he was concerned that asset sales revenues would not last as long as leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would return again from scratch."
Churches, he added, could have been replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not help keep the holy places left around him.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white people," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the day in which these churches are closed simultaneously because it is unlikely that those who move to the condominium will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis city - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist Church moved in the 1930s.
The black church that has been worshiping in the surrounding area has taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retail traders on the 125th road, the main road to shopping in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 caused the building to be severely damaged, but when parishioners of the Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild, they built tower bells.
Reverend David Johnson, Son of the Reverend Johnson and his successor in St. Martin proudly referred to the tower bell as the "Long bell of the poor"
An expert who sounded the tower bell in July gave him another designation: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first tower bell played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind who turned to ring a larger tower bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in recent months is an elaborate architectural and contractor story, some brought by lay church leaders, and others brought by the diocese of Episcopal.
The vestry - the body of the diocese manager, formed from public leaders - wrote a letter to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "will seek to charge" on the vestry party, although the vestry is not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency from the diocese.
shark injures 13-year-old teenager in lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch a lobster in California at the opening of the lobster season, an officer said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then rowed in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first she thought it was just a sigh of joy after capturing the lobster, but then she "knows" that the boy shouted, ‘I was bitten!
I'm being bitten!"
“The whole bone of his collar was torn,” Hammel said that he realized it when he had already grabbed the child.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’ Hammel added.
The child was flown to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coast Rescue Captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area one week earlier, but it was categorized as an harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for the sake of investigation and security.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 shark species in the region, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break the British beauty market
Sainsbury took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with toserba-style beauty stalls run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial boost to the British beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of fashion products and household appliances are declining, larger beauty stalls will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if it proves successful.
Investing in beauty becomes a hunting ground for supermarkets to harness the shelves that used to be used as a TV, microwave, and household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the size of beauty offerings up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie,Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of brands starting from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas such as those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its boutique makeup series so that most of its products would be friendly to vegans - something that young shoppers are increasingly interested in.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury stores, the first to open in Croydon. south London last week, while the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
Online shopping and switching the purchase of a small amount of daily food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury, has said that the stalls will look more like Mall when the supermarket chain is trying to counter the suppressors like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and non-food services.
Sainsbury has put Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat outlets since they bought both franchises two years ago, which he said has supported the sale of daily food items and made more profitable acquisitions.
Previous supermarket efforts to renovate the beauty and pharmaceutical department ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but cooperation ended after a conflict over how to divide profits from chemical stores in the supermarket.
A new strategy comes after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical shop businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical franchise, worth <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
It was stated that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a variety of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sciencebury, said: "We have changed the look and feel on beauty stalls to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand range is designed so that it fits all the needs, exciting environments and convenient locations signifying that we are currently a lucrative destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘geram' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11million
Dragons Den star Peter Jones went ‘shocked' after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle business deal to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time to manage their household equipment and accessories trademarks, True.
The pair’s business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning’s host, 37, used his Instagram account to announce that he was out.
Holly Willoughby has made a Dragons star" Den, Petes Jones is furious by withdrawing at the last moments, from their lucrative branded lifestyle business - to focus on his larger contract with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was so "groomed" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business royal headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal—was worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million—meaning she no longer had enough time to devote to the trademark of their household appliances and accessories, True.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortunes of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, uses Instagram to announce that he is leaving True, Jones flies leaving Britain towards one of his holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
It will be his long-term future, which will keep him for decades to come.
His decision to step back made everyone involved very surprised.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, very close to the launch time.
There's a warehouse full of items in Marlow's main office ready for sale"
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, which is one of the most expensive British stars, could cost the company up to millions of dollars due to large investments in product form, ranging from pillows and candles to home clothes and supplies, as well as the potential for further launch delays.
And this can mean the end of a long-standing friendship relationship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby founded True along with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owned 40 percent of the shares on Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV called I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We're not going to comment on this business relationship."
Talk seriously ‘and then we fall in love'
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making comments that some consider to be "unpresidential" and has been very positive towards North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mock voice of his “newsreader”.
"I don't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting a second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a step forward for North Korean denuclearization.
But the negotiation of denuclearization has stopped.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders in. The UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an “accurate response” from the United States against the initial North Korean disarmament movement.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump is more optimistic in his speech.
"We do our best with North Korea," he said.
“If we fight with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He said that his success to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results – stopping rocket experiments, helping to free hostages and repatriate the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his uncommon approach in talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental foreign organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population lost residence, there was no national disaster statement, as a prerequisite for bringing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they don't ask for international help, so this is a bit challenging," Budap said.
While Save The Children is putting together a team to leave for Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff could work on the pitch.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster relief agency, said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute.
Given the constant global shocks that Indonesia has experienced, the country is still very unprepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although warnings of danger have already been made, most likely have contributed to the presence of casualties.
At the best times, travel among many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
Floating hospitals that have been stationed in Lombok to care for victims of the earthquake are heading to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach a new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs of Indonesia’s damaged infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of highways and railroads.
But the lack of funds has disrupted Mr. Joko's government while he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority Muslim members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes when Muslim and Christian hordes fought in the streets, using fields, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge has scored a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League with one score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from outside Chelsea's goal when his team were away 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left side before kicking it towards a distant pole.
The ball soared high above the goal when the ball soared to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and taking one chance and not thinking too much about it, and just doing a kick."
Chelsea led by a 1-0 score in the first half after Belgian flag player Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue striker gave feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before turning near midfield and running fast to the central part of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave the bait and ran in the middle.
He then did the perfect kick, leading Hazard towards the goal.
Hazard managed to pass the opponent's defender and kicked the ball into the wicket corner with a left-footed kick, past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool against Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faced Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832 people, the state disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are reported to be trapped in buildings damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit Friday and triggered a 20-foot high wave, Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency said in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, is filled with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been carried out after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found on Grayson Mews, John's street, at 7.55 a.m. with several stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was held on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people around who saw or heard something to come face to face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation was still in the early stages but I asked everyone around John's street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may record something on the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing as police have said, they are in the process of informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just returned to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man couldn’t say anything when he knew what was going on.
The citizens are currently being told that it will take several hours until they are allowed to re-enter.
A police officer was heard telling someone that all areas are now being imposed as scenes of the matter.
A woman appeared on the spot in a state of crying.
He always said, ‘This is horrible.'
At 2 p.m. two police vans were on the line and the others were outside.
A number of officers stood in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone who has the information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCc, phone 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by citing 247 logs on September 30.
Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes the last memorial to be affected by ‘historical rewrite'
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban against many British cultural and religious artifacts carried out by the fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "failure" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "This is inevitable in the current debate about the destruction of statues, that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster's palace would be targeted.
The British civil war iconoclasm was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong descendant of Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is an evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed many still deserved to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in his case of course the government.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation, it is still a subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century had shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell was an individually recognizable figure representing one side of the difference.
His success as a Protector is also worthy to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer Pigs persecuted Chinese farmers to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pig cage in the Liupanshui district market of Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject a vaccine to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining province of <0x51>inghai, China.
She reportedly had gone with her cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the nearby pig cage door had opened.
He said that in a pig cage there was a large pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirmed that the 550-pound male pig had persecuted the breeder to death, according to reports.
"Betis my cousin is bleeding and destroyed," said a cousin known by the name of "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities were reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks against humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in the man seriously injured.
10 years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer into his tractor until the wife was frightened and drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive but blood scents could act as "the trigger".
"They're just playing.
They're gums, very curious... they're not going out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect," he said.
The remnants of the storm Rosa brought heavy rains to the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding throughout the northern and southwestern regions of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa has winds at 85 mph, Hurricane Category 1, starting at 5 a.m. East Region time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely moving northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pale began to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, towards the US West Coast. As Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain would lead to dangerous round flooding, streams of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will lead to rainfall levels approaching 2 to 3 inches per hour at some point, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
A total of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected to fall in parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Flood floods are likely to occur with conditions that deteriorate rapidly due to the spreading nature of tropical rainfall.
It is highly not recommended to explore the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause the abyss to become malignant rivers and storms will bring local strong winds and dusty.
The approaching trough will cause local heavy rains to parts of the South California coastline.
Total rainfall that exceeds half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to slip.
It will be the first rain in the region during their rainy season.
Some of the scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before the rain becomes wider on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain warm enough.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
There is a precise example of dramatic temperature differences along the central U.S. region on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer warmth will form and again spread.
Most parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to begin warm starting in October at a spreading speed of 80s from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show high odds for above average temperatures for the eastern U.S. to mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by potential Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and women who accused him of sexually assaulting him allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political stalemates continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular events to announce an unexpected incident at the last minute of Friday: A deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh had drunk her body and tried to take off her clothes at the High School party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
There are likely more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, having watched it.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for other networks broadcasting this is not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty in counting the number of people watching it in the office.
To put this in perspective, it is an almost equal number of viewers to a football playoff game or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose host opinion strongly supports Kavanaugh's appointment, excelled from all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Fans remain high after the trial.
Flake is a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning's CNN and CBS cameras were being shouted by protesters when he tried to lift the elevator to a trial of the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was sacked, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power when there are many women who are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee hearing.
Cable TVs and broadcast networks all covered live hours later, when the Justice Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he would only do that with the understanding that the FBI would examine the charges against the candidate for the first week, as minority Democrats have asked.
Flake has been partially convinced by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was clear that the Republican party would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of ‘playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interests, on her plan to exit the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews featuring him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed an attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal on Britain and the EU that should collect tariffs on each other is "completely unreasonable."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death.
Police have arrested a suspect on fatal shooting resulting in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and in prison on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson's DNA on the item, the affiliate WAFB CBS reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he claimed he had committed a fatal shooting against Wayde.
The contract has been set at <0x24>350,000, the Advocate reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through to the neck.
The department thanked Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and surrounding citizens in assisting investigations leading to arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked regional law enforcement for "defence and justice quest."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
With a height of 6.6 feet living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and soared up to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "destroyed" and "surprised" with Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano blasts ash in Mexico City
The ashes coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern area around the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes after activity increased in craters and registered there were 183 gas and ash emissions in more than 24 hours.
The center monitored several times the rumbling and vibration.
Pictures on social media showed a thin layer of ash sticking to the car’s windshield in the surrounding Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in volcanoes located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the celebration of the independence election.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence demonstration participants clashed with anti-rule police, and when thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarization vote on segregation.
A group of masked pro-separatis detained by the riot police threw them with eggs and threw powder paint, thus creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that would normally be filled by tourists.
The dispute also happened later that day with police using their wands to control the dispute.
For several hours pro-independence groups shouted "Never forget, no forgiveness" confronted union protesters shouting, "Live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in this independent-oriented region, a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters prefer to be independent, although the number of voters is low with those opposed to segregation and mostly boycott the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop polling in TPS across the region in fierce clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support national police.
Demonstrations continued but were forced to take different routes.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hoped about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite winning a vital victory despite little in the regional election last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain this year's momentum despite many of their well-known leaders, who are either in exile or in custody waiting for the trial, for their role in regulating the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest with her phone to support police, said the conflict had been triggered by politicians on either side.
"It's getting more stressful," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed pre-conference since the end of last year, announced that he will run in the next year's European Parliament election.
"Standing as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn setbacks in the values of democracy and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage occurred on the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired towards the car at some point.
Goals scored by Menga have won for Livingston over the Rangers by a score of 1-0
Dolly Mega's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston's win resulted in Rangers sacking Steven Gerrard from his post as manager of club Ibrox, over his second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is equivalent to Hibernian who is in second place.
Gerrard’s side remain without a win in the Premiership this season and face Hearts leaders who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the European League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their invincible record in the division to six games, while head coach Holt has still beaten a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances against a sloppy guest team
Holt's team should have already excelled long before they scored, with their accuracy giving Rangers a variety of difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his attempt missed across the wicket face, then Alan Lithgow could only widen his effort after sliding in and facing Craig Halkett's lead from across the wicket.
The hosts feel content to let the Rangers play superior at the start, knowing that they can make it difficult for the arrival team over the occurrence of dead balls.
And that’s the way to create a very important goal.
The Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Mega, who got a turn and scored from midfield.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the dominance but realized that the host's defense could not be penetrated and goalkeeper Liam Kelly as a whole was uninterrupted,
The pattern continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to fish a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was chased by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow were knocked away due to another Livingston game tactic.
The attack continued to come to Livingston's goal and was constantly avoided, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge at Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for handball - were rejected.
‘Fenomenal' of Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they were incredible, continuing beyond expectations on this continuing uprising trajectory.
Their style of play and personnel have barely changed since they returned to the top, but big credits have to be given to Holt for the way he reinforced the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Halkett's captain was enormous, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall continue to be vigilant during the game.
Nevertheless, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Whatever they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not good – only once they could break the host side formation – and it was a warning to the Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan received mixed receptions in Cologne.
There was a smile and a stretch of blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They argued on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police mentioned security reasons to block a crowd of 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also voiced, denounced both, Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The resistance protests described the conflict over the existence of an immigrant who was greeted as a hero by several German Turks and was denounced as a dictator by the rest of the population.
Crash on Deptford highway: Bicycle rider killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near the tributary of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a crash running on Childers Street, about 1 mile away from the Saturday collision.
Metropolitan Police said that officers were trying to identify the man and alert his family.
Roads closed and bus lanes diversion have been enacted as well as motorists are required to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six wardens were injured in a riot in a man's prison with strict care, the office later stated.
The chaos arose at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST (GMT<0x2B>0100) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
"Tornado" Specialist officers have been deployed to handle the riot, which involved eight prisoners and occurred on one side of the building.
The officers were treated at the scene due to minor injuries on the face.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained latent officers have been deployed to deal with the incidents taking place in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that the responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend a longer time behind the iron bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison chief was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October of last year anti-harming officers were called to prison to deal with serious riots where an late officer was attacked with a billiard ball.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Flood Floods (Lightland May Benefit)
Tropical depression that hit Arizona is rare, but that is what is most likely to happen early next week due to Hurricane Rosa’s energy trail remaining through the southwestern desert, causing the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings for flooding on Monday and Tuesday for the region of West Arizona to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to lead directly past Phoenix on Tuesday, going to hit on Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that there are only "ten tropical hurricanes capable of causing tropical storms or depressive status in 200 miles of Phoenix territory since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border region."
The latest Hurricane Center Peerage Tool is capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the southwestern desert include the central Rockies and the Great Basin are most likely to be exposed to 1 to 2 inches, with a possible amount of isolation reaching 4 inches.
For those in a flood-free region, the rains of Rosa may be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of these rainfall is most likely beneficial because currently the southwest region is being hit by drought.
According to U.S. drought observers, only about 40 percent of Arizona’s regions experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” weather.com reported.
First, the route through Hurricane Rosa leads to land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico
Rosa, still at storm power on Sunday morning at wind speeds 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moved north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets the region's colder waters in the Pacific and therefore its strength weakens.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm power on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, posing a high risk of flooding
"The total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected to hit the Baja region of California to the southwestern region of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weatherer.com reported.
Rosa will then cross the northern part along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will pass through Arizona and into southern Utah on Tuesday midnight.
"The major risks that may have been caused by a Rosa storm or the remains are very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern region of Sonora, and the U.S. southwestern region of the U.S. desert." The National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated.
The rain is expected to lead to threats of flooding and debris of buildings flowing into the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest of four suspects attempted murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for alleged attempted murder after a 16-year-old male teenager was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace region of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in a "stabil" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset regions, police said.
Officers have already appealed to anyone who may have video footage of the incident on his phone to come and report.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘receives hatred and anger' from Democrats
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to reject the ruthless and embarrassing Democratic Party probe," Trump said in a campaign in Wheeling, western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "accepted hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the candidacy process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied a charge from Christine Blasey Ford that she committed sexual assault on her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's intelligence and quality and courage that day.
"One vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is the voice to confirm someone who has the most perfect legal thought of our time, a jury with a true public servant trail record," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-election.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m really racing,” he said.
"That's why I went there, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "fight and block."
The first prosedural vote at the Senate level in Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to be implemented at the slowest Friday, a senior GOP leader's aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people died from an Indonesian earthquake, a tsunami, with an increasing number of casualties
At least 384 people were killed, many were drifting as giant waves hit the coast, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18 ft) high wave destroyed the beach during dusk, causing many deaths and destroying whatever it passed through.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“As the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Disaster Control Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, wood, houses, hit everything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed the ocean off at 800 kph (497 mph) before crashing the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Air photos released by BNPB show many buildings and shops destroyed, twisted bridges and collapsed as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
A series of aftershocks rocked the city along the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes are felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The BPPT said in a statement that the energy released on a massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the explosive power of an atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima in the second World War.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the tip of a long narrow bay, can enlarge the size of the tsunami, can be said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the ruins of the destroyed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could have been greater along the 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu coastline, a region called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communication "is completely paralyzed with the absence of information from Dongala," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading toward the affected region.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The related agency on Saturday received numerous criticism for not informing that there was a tsunami that hit Palu, although authorities said the wave had already hit at the time of the warning being issued.
An amateur recording shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building heard screaming a warning in a panic of a tsunami approaching, towards people on the streets below him.
Within minutes the water rolls hit the beach, slamming buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately prove the authenticity of the footage.
Earthquakes and tsunamis were the biggest cause of power outages that broke out communications around Palu thus making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has already started sending cargo planes containing aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The airport has been reopened only to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesian Tsunami victims have risen above 800.
That's so horrible.
When World Vision officials from Dongala had managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where the officers took shelter in a tarpaulin cloth tent built on their office yard, on their way they had passed through various lands, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
That's so horrible.
Even when relief groups began to move slowly to start disaster-fighting activities, some of the group complained of defiance against foreign volunteers who had expertise, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, aid from overseas goods and energy can only begin to be channeled if the affected area has been officially declared a national disaster region.
That hasn't happened.
"This is still a provincial level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the time the Government said, OKE, this is a national disaster," we could receive international aid, but there is no such status."
On the second night of the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be part of a miracle that will improve the tragic plot of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from the got.
On Sunday, the rescuer pulled out a woman who was stuck under the rubble for two days with the mother's body next to him.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of Indonesia's national paralayang team, has been the coach for two missing paralayang athletes, who have attended the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Mr. Mandagi, are his disciples.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recounts how after news of the ruined Roa-Roa Hotel circulated around the paralayang community, desperately sending WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu, who participated in the beach celebrations.
However, all of his messages, only get a single grey twitch mark, rather than two blue twitches.
"I think that means the message is not sent," he said.
The robber took <0x24>26,750 during ATM charging in Newport in Levee
The robber on Friday morning, stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink officer who was refilling the ATM engine storage box in Newport, based on reports from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver had already emptied an ATM engine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a newsletter.
While he is working, another man "runs from behind the Brink worker" and steals one bag containing the money to be sent.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, based on the news, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity can contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change of the name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former was formally known as Kanye West."
West, aged 41, already had Ye's nickname for some time and used the name as his eighth album title, which was released in June.
The change was made before his performance on Saturday Night Live, as he was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was cancelled due to "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that for him the word had a religious meaning.
“I believe ‘ye' is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘You’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with Radio Big Boy broadcaster.
“So I’m you, I’m us, that name is us.
The name is derived from Kanye, meaning only the only one, being Ye - as the mirror of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, all.
The album is more of a reflection of our true self."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs in various ways has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a link sign and a large letter.
Mexico’s president, AMLO, vowed not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilian society ahead of the 50th anniversary of bloody countermeasures against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to pressure Mexicans."
The army launched a fire at peaceful demonstrations on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, when the movement of left-wing students instilled its roots across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies for those who are studying and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encourage young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of A.I.
Since China is more active in terms of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funds to be used for research in the field, said A2 investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who already works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made an announcement on AI, even when the U.S. overall lacked a formal AI strategy.
China introduced its plan last year: aiming to become number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Using AI research funds is a good start, given that all other countries tend to be away from the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the AI field,” Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances so that the next major AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovacation Ventures, who has already invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beats the best American Othello player, and after that he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competition such as the Robotics Challenge for the Latest Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be implemented, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win prizes from the Government, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leadership; it's the company," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have already employed figures from the university for AI research in recent years.
Lee said that immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. to support efforts around the AI.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for PHD title holders in AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funds for people in academic institutions just as the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations share money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic tasks is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at engaging industry and academic partners, and the White House announced a Committee Select formation for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month the DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, DARPA recently invested more than 100 million dollars a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation asking for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence did not see any follow-up for months.
The people of Macedonia voted in order to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday to decide the country's name change to "North Macedonia Republic," an act that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has denied its membership bid to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the opinion that the name of its northern neighbour represents recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned the joining of the country with NATO and the European Union.
Both governments reached an agreement in June under a new name filed, but nationalist opposition argued that changes would undermine the identity of most of the ethnic population of Slavic Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the general election and a boycott campaign has instilled doubt as to whether the election results could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the votes required for the election results to be declared legitimate.
The question on the ballot reads: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price worthy to be paid to obtain entry permits into bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born from the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the sake of the younger generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs say they will comply with the results of the vote to make a decision.
The name change requires a vote of two-thirds in parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, it turned out that the vote results had only reached 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their vote letters.
"I came to vote for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote for elections in Macedonia in order to change the country's name that would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, has prepared a small stage and pulled seats in front of tents made by those who would boycott the vote.
"We agree to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join honorably, not through the server door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia as well as be part of the Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most of the population will approve it because more than 80 percent of our communities support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said the results of "yes" would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institution on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the required amount.
Another poll, hosted by TV station Telma Macedonia, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
In order for the vote to be successful, it took 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure in the vote will represent the first policy rejection of the pro-Western government since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City explored Brighton's entire defense to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton's defenses on Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received an opera in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton, before sliding into the open field.
Aguero then finds himself surrounded by four green-capped people.
He rotated past one defender before running ahead of several more opponents at the end of Brighton's wicket.
Then he turned to his left, to Sterling.
The England forward utilized his first kick from the wicket direction to past the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to defeat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero struggled with some problems at his feet," Pep Guardiola City manager told reporters.
"We're talking about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re glad he scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, deep inside the Brighton region on that game.
He drove the ball with a far-off kick that was stunning through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little skew the ball before leading Sterling to the farthest post.
The forward midfielder Sky Blue dribbled the ball towards the goal just before the ball slid out of the border.

Scherzer wants to complain about spoilers versus Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there is no reason to impose another game.
But too competitive Scherzer hopes to outperform the Colorado Rockies in a game on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who excel in one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned a spot after winning a wild-card match against the Nationals by a 5-2 score on Friday night, but are still trying to reach their first division title.
"Although we played without winning, at least we could find out the atmosphere in Denver with a crowd of spectators and other teams that will compete at the highest level from any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a game?"
The Nationals have not announced an opening match for Sunday, but it is reported that under such circumstances, they tend to let Scherzer compete.
Scherzer, who will start the match for the 34 times, held a practice session on Thursday and started a Sunday game usually used to rest.
Washington's right-hand pitcher was a scorer 18-7 with a run average (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings of this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The President implicitly referred to the situation in which the candidate Supreme Court Justice of his choice, Brett Kavanaugh, spoke about the importance of the Republican vote in the middle of the election.
"All the efforts we've done are at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting all over the place for an incredible candidate," he said.
Trump continued, “You see a radical Democratic group that’s very scary, you can see it’s happening right now.
And they decide to take back power in any way, you see evil, their abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to snatch in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, were on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad and evil and disgusting and unbelievable."
He referred to Senate Dianne Feinstein who served on the Senate Justice Committee by naming her name, which was greeted with a loud crackdown from her listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh no, I waited for him - it was a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a public service place.
He is now intolerant to anyone who puts his mind on.
When Momentum activists at my local party voted to condemn myself, it was not surprising.
After all, I was in the last order of the Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected - all of that because we voiced the opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan had similar treatment because he defended antisemitism firmly.
In my case, the motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, in Europe, issues that are ironically the same as those opposed by Jeremy Corbyn with previous leaders.
Notifications for the East Nottingham workers' meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years I became a member of the local Labour Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on Friday Night was exactly that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and appointments regarding politics that are "better, more friendly" rather than have long been forgotten, if, indeed, it ever began.
The differences in opinion in the labour party are increasingly clear tolerable and each opinion is assessed by the authority of the party.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague I once thought would be able to share the same political views, started expecting me to turn around and accept a position I would never have been willing to accept - both in both the national security and the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly - and no matter what I say - then after that there will be a crackdown on social media asking for cancellation of appointments, denouncing central politics, telling me I should not be in the Labour party.
And that's not the only one I've experienced.
Sure, I know that I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments aimed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual abuse or racism every day but never avoid.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is how much abuse has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should help develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer on the wider church and with each motion "unconfident" or turn the selection of party rules into more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that encouraged me to keep my head down, not too vocally, and then I would say "well."
But I jump into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher's government which resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsing, I have been trying to fight for better public service for those who desperately need it - both as a local counselor and a minister in government.
I never hide my political action, including at the last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my policy position and things I disagree with in current leadership.
For those who advocate a motion on Friday, all I can say is that when the country moves quickly towards the division of sovereignty (Brexit), it will jeopardize our country's business and public services, I don't want to waste time and energy for loyalty to Labour party leaders.
But in fact, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, as a member of the Labour party or not.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr rises to top position
The last two experiments may have been a little tricky of the finals, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to win a very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
Now they are in the top, the only undefeated side out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and ability to reach the best odds, which made the home team and coach Peter Murchie get the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still unbeaten so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Awards for Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, was given to the game by the Warriors, giving Melrose a chance to score and Jason Baggot scooped an unconverted try.
Climo loosened Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, right in mid-time, he scored then made a single try to make Ayr's score 17-5 at rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's altered attempt by Baggot, reducing odds by up to five points.
Then there was a long break because Ruaridh Knott had serious injuries, was pushed out, and since the game's start, Ayr drove faster beyond Stafford McDowall's attempt, altered by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then exposed to a yellow card and again, Melrose made a reserve player pay with an unchanged Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of hard pressure.
The host had returned to play, but, by the time the Hutchinson Struan got a yellow card for encircling climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind Ayr's forward wounded.
Climo was replaced, as it happened again, almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe made a goal-kick and thwarted Gregor Henry's fifth try.
Still Game star looks ready for his new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran looks ready to move forward to the service industry after it was previously known that he was named a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis filmed at the BBC popular show, which was directed and also starred alongside his longtime comedian Greg Hemphill.
The couple had already announced that the upcoming nine series was the last episode, and apparently Kiernan planned to guide the live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was trying to engage in "a growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours: Bolivia surrounded by the mainland hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
Sailors patrol at the naval headquarters located in La Paz.
The public building raised a blue sea flag.
The Naval Base from Titicaca to Amazon was polished with a motto: "The Sea is our legitimate property.
To resurrect is an obligation.”
Passing through Bolivia surrounded by land, memories of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a 19th-century bloody conflict are still apparent - such as a desire to once again traverse the Pacific Ocean.
It was likely to reach its peak in decades, as Bolivia waited for a court order on October 1, after five years of talks.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope about the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ trial on screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia's demands that - after decades of tense negotiations -Chile is obliged to negotiate the guarantee of Bolivia's sovereignty over the ocean.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian indigenous President who faces controversial warfare for next year's election - also has a lot of support at Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific Sea," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts are convinced that the court is unlikely to decide Bolivia's wishes - and it will only change a little if it is possible.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to surrender the territory of Chile, and has already established that it will not decide the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ICJ's rule came just six months after the final argument had been heard, which indicated the case was "not complex," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean international law expert.
And still far from continuing Bolivia’s demands, in the last four years it may have been a setback.
"The problem of access to the sea has already been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has weakened the goodwill of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will remain in talks, but it will be very difficult to stay in discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's government vice-president in The Hague rejected the idea of quick decision-making.
On Monday it will give Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-still one of the most famous Latin American presidents-using maritime issues as a political advocate.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The conference is an opportunity to see what we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country's first ever would never disarm nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned about the United States carrying out a deal made at a meeting in Singapore between competing leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was seen almost starting nuclear diplomacy that had been dead for more than three months after a meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri said only a "summer dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the declaration of the Korean War settlement would make North Korea surrender.
Washington was on the lookout to approve the declaration without Pyongyang’s first attempt to restrict the armed forces.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is a widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the recognition of the arms warehouse that for the country is the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
The Paris fashion show shows a lot of the latest collection of head coverings to the main street near you.
If you want to multiply a collection of hats or really want to be protected from sunlight do not look for anything else.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers issued a series of large-size head coverings for their SS19 collection on the fashion show stage in a stunning style held at Paris Fashion Week.
A truly impractical hat has swept Instagram this summer and these designers have already shown an eye-catching creation on the stage of the show.
What stands out from Valentino is a creamy color hat on which it is decorated with a wide fringe of fur tub covering the model's head.
Large-sized accessories include diamond-sized watermelons, witch hats and even a pineapple, but are not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a group of strange-and-right masks ahead of Halloween.
Many masks of color have already been sewn and look like Hannibal Lecter compared to haute couture.
A creation similar to a scuba submarine is equipped with snorkels and glasses, while others look like melting ice cream.
And if you continue to browse the collection of the acbar mode - then you're lucky.
Mode observers estimate that the large hat collection will be marketed to the main road near you.
Large-sized hats became a very lyrical trend in ‘La Bomba’, a straw hat with a fringe with a width of two feet seen to be worn by everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label worship behind a very impractical hat of social media makes a great creation on the beach paintwalks of a vast straw almost the same as a swimwear - worn with a sledge model.
The burning orange rafia bag, slammed with a rafia on the edge with a white grip rope, is a prominent feature of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see a big hat and a beach bag arrive on the main road for next summer - as designers have already made a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for such large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens
Scottish private schools keep track of academic excellence, and this is continued in 2018 with outstanding test results, which are increasingly reinforced by every student and collective success in sports, art, music as well as hard efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Board (SCIS) strive to provide the best service for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as world citizens.
As the education sector that can design and implement the school curriculum as expected, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice subject in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, your speech will go into his head.
If you talk to him in his language, your speech will go into his heart.”
It’s a strong reminder that we can’t rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test results of the year, we can see that language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages earn A Plus grades.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools showing that 72 percent of students get A Plus grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent who learn Spanish also get A grades.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important skill that will certainly be needed by children and adolescents in the future.
Today languages, as a choice of subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Service in 2014 found that from some reason why employers should continue to struggle to fill the vacancies, 17 percent of the reason is a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their careers in the future.
With the growing number of job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are important in the global world.
Whatever career choices a person, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will feel the real benefits of having this kind of life-long skill.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of a foreign country will automatically make a multilingual superior in the competition.
According to a YouGov poll in more than 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to perform conversations and French became the only spoken language in two digits percentages, which is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today’s children is important for today’s children.
Having multilingual skills, especially the language of countries with a growing economy, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the language that is considered the most important in the UK for the next few years, i.e. 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be chosen in independent schools, with an expert teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are aimed at providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is undeniable that today, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills."
The independent school will continue to offer these choices, diversity, and excellence for Scottish teenagers.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent School Board
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The fans' expectation to see LeBron James debuting for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening pre-season Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After an early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season six-game schedule.
"At the current stage of my career, I don't need to do pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump's General Meeting Schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a general campaign meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first public meeting of five public meetings scheduled for next week, including a cessation in some pleasant places covering Tennessee and Mississippi.
After asserting that the vote was postponed so that he could vote for the Supreme Court's office filler, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming part-time general election because the Republicans were at risk of losing Congressional control if the vote was made in November.
What time is Trump’s public meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's general meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s public meeting in West Virginia online via live broadcasts on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearing for future Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is increasingly strained after allegations of indecent sexual acts and Senate voting estimates will be postponed to one week while the FBI investigates him.
But the main goal of this general meeting agenda is to help Republicans get some momentum in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign it mentioned that the next five general meetings were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters because Republicans tried to protect and expand the majority they held in the Senate and the House," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for its agenda that the president will travel as much as possible to the states as we face a busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who refused to mention his name told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, a public meeting tonight is expected to present supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as withdraw coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrsey, a West Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party who was left behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrsey so the president should come as an effort to increase his earnings in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows courage to defend its hopes in the face of Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursome sessions are what may be required in this Ryder Cup.
Momentum penguins are a sport concept that is the result of findings that are fully trusted by players, and nothing exceeds that in competitions like this.
Where do they think the momentum is today?
“Before, they were six points ahead and now four, so I think we consider it a little momentum,” Jordan Spieth said.
Of course Europe has the advantage because it excels four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had a bit of momentum and they had a lot of things that could be a spirit, no exception to the formations of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each proudly three out of four points.
Spieth has played lethally from the tee area to the green area and leads with exemplary precedence.
The parade’s chanting was getting tougher as it turned out, doing an important putting punch to make the series match as he and Thomas lost two opponents.
The beat putting of him who won them at the number 15 welcomed with a similar cry, a cry that tells you that he is sure America is not losing.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes that need to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The unique but interesting pair from Europe is four to four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they were also spared from bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seems to flow both to and from this crowded crowd that is convincing that they are players to be defeated on Sunday, and no player is more famous than Fleetwood and Molinari will lock up the potential European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It would be better if at the same time both were placed in a different hole.
However, it’s still too early to talk about Europe’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shorten Sergio Garcia's work, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine like digging a hole that this Spanish and Swedish golfer could never climb.
However, on Sundays no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are great shows to see closer because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how strategies can change instantly.
So far, Europe played better as a team and led far enough towards the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team had the guts to compete despite some doubts, especially in the United States.
Europe top 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the Ryder Cup final day after rising from Saturday’s fourball and foursome matches by a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to record their points so far at Le Golf National with four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to retain the untimely trophy at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American team in the morning fourball, making the series’ result 3-1.
The United States gave more matches in the foursome, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Team Jim Furyk needed eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to defend the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debutant to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, were only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs they became very solid to defeat Woods who bounced and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau more firmly 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally appeared brilliant but has lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourball and foursome as well as seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested on fourball mornings, then returned to pairing with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2<0x26>1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three worlds.
Europe did not achieve it on its own though it was a fun and windy day in southwestern Paris.
The three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for America by two points on Saturday.
They got an interesting 2<0x26>1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball then returned again to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4<0x26>3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
It only happened twice in Ryder Cup history where a team returned from a four-point deficit going into a single game, although as the defending champions of the Furyk team only needed a series point to defend the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday’s counterattack looked like it would go beyond them.
North Korea says 'unprecedented' will disarm unilaterally without any trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on sanctions that continuously deepened their distrust of the United States and it was unlikely that the country would unilaterally remove its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures showing goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing locations, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any appropriate responses from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it would be impossible for us to disarm ourselves first unilaterally.”
While Ri repeated the same complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "stage" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be punished for taking a gradual step, a significant statement said it did not fully reject them as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between U.S. presidential officials and North Korean leaders who were first held in Singapore on June 12, at which point Kim pledged to work on "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged North Korea's security assurance.
North Korea has wanted the end of the 1950-53 Korean War officially, but the United States says that Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected a call to loosen international heavy sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclarization first" and increases pressure by giving semi sanctions to their goals forcibly, and even rejects "the final statement of war," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us bend our knees is the illusion of people who don’t know about us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions will deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by U.S. leaders at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the troubled side of this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not reach this kind of dead end."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, as he spoke to the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean rockets on the mainland of the United States was an inevitable thing after Trump's "Mr. President of the Devil" called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN meeting, Trump who last year threatened to "destruct" North Korea in total, applaud Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but the big work still has to be carried out and sanctions must remain imposed until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If this takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions should be continued decisively and should not fail until we know that full denuclearization, final and verified."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an effort to stop Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile financing.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July while saying that there had actually been progress, only North Korea in a matter of hours ambushed that he made "a gangster-like claim."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle missile locations as well as nuclear complexes if the United States took "appropriate action."
He stated that Kim told him to do "appropriate actions" with his wishes was a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students there sleep more, in an attempt to fight macho culture in an emerging learning through a caffeine-powered 'owl man'.
An academic finds that students at world number one universities often don’t know anything if they discuss very basic things about how to keep themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine specializing in sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and specialists at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of his kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
'In the end a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I just told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
This year’s first launched course explains to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health care, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding students who were very sleep deprived throughout the week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there is a picture of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the effects of caffeine and lights, as well as how athletic results are affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep routines.
In other sections, participants got an explanation of how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know this will not change the behavior of the student instantly.
But we are convinced that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health," said Prof Czeisler.
The culture of pride with ‘surgery’ still exists, he added, adding that modern technology and growing pressure in students meaning sleep deprivation is an ever-growing problem.
Ensure you sleep enough, with good quality, should be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he says - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to activate the mode of hunger, causing a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California resident who studied physical chemistry and biology that helped Professor Czechisler design the course, has taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes that all graduate students be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students should consider regulating sleeptime alarms, as well as wake alarms, and be aware of the effects of ‘blue lights' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its layout path thus causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Mengga lowers Gerrard's team mentally
Again, the Rangers felt the sadness of the day away as Dolly Mengga's attack delivered a watery Steven Gerrard team in a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's team attempted to record their first win on their way, since a 4-1 victory in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had just given Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as a manager, causing his team to miss eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Attacking seven minutes before the first half was over and the Rangers players who ran out of sense didn’t seem to compensate.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston rose to third, leaving only a goal difference from Hibernian.
And it could be that there would be further problems in the Rangers' fort after line guard Calum Spence had to be treated due to a wound in the head after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtakes Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
On the contrary, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and he would be happy with the costume that impressed their opponents on every occasion.
The Rangers may dominate possession of the ball, but Livingston utilizes the ball they have better.
They were supposed to have recorded the score in just two minutes when Menga's first short pass was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder drew that big chance too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick then met captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide in the back position.
Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than confidence about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he was supposed to get a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided on a quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected this Colombian citizen's appeal.
Rangers only managed to do two throws in the first half but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was almost never problematic with the headshot of Lassana Coulibaly and the easy-to-point Ovie Ejaria attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposite the course of the match, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher placed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calmly choosing Mega for a simple end.
Gerrard acted during the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the turn almost made a direct impact as the winger put the ball on Morelos but Kelly who played impressively quickly came out of the line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the away team to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team were supposed to widen their lead in the final stage but McGregor stood well to distract Jacobs before Lithgow subducted wide from the corner.
Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty as he clashed with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face down.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Defects
And now from our Almanac's "Sunday Morning" page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE FIRST WITH THE day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, it was an invention that eventually made the device known as the Geiger Deccacah.
Being a leading tool of science since then, Pencacah Geiger has also been a flagship of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring the seemingly less convincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Decatur, used to find the location of radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When using this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, it must be coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccines teach the immune system to ‘recognize’ evil cells
New cancer vaccines teach the immune system to 'know' evil cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory
They can then 'know' the protein that is common in many cancers and then injected again
An experimental vaccine showed promising results in patients with a wide range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize evil cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves the patient's immune cell extraction process, transforming it in the laboratory so that they can "recognize" proteins commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting them back into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Society in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colorectal, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
The same approach as patient's immune cell intake and "teach" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West Begins Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing MAGA Hat, After Her SNL Appearance.
Not running well.
Kanye West was scorned at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said she would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, titled Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic party and repeated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say: ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL started the show with a play starring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on claims of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the West caci-maki footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the stage due to the hat worn.
"They're hurting me behind the stage.
They said, “Don’t go out with that hat.”
They're haunting me!
And then they say I'm drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see a sinking place?" saying that he's going to wear Superman's robe, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do. You want the world forward?
Try to love."
His comments resulted in ridicule at least twice from the audience and the SNL cast looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person noting: "The whole studio was silent."
West was brought in at the last moments as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, a former girlfriend of rapper Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confuses many people with the performance of his song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West received support from the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest souls: THE TRUTH OF THE RIGHTEOUS."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being himself and it was really great."
“But I choose to NOT reward someone (by buying his music or shirt or supporting his “art”) that I believe embraces and unleashes a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "a creature officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change the name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg got the name of Snoop Lion and certainly the late Prince music legend, changing his name to a symbol and later an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword swing in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of the HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, refutes the stereotypes of macho heroes, he says that roles on such screens make young boys often feel that they should be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed 'there was something wrong' and questioned how to deal with bad masculinity problems in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his opponent at Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'strong enough' in discussing the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strong, right now - where is our fault in terms of this masculinity?' he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes television may be responsible for the emergence of poor masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'Where is the character from birth and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they should have this particular side to be boys?
I think it's really one of the big questions of the time - how do we change it?
Because obviously there is something wrong for the young people.”
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in the prequel or sequel Game of Thrones as the series would end next summer, saying that he was already 'finished with battlefields and horses'.
Since November Kit will star in the return of True West from Sam Shepard, the story of the film's producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this show, thus giving me a family of the future, and from here my life started.”
Rose plays Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of the Leslie family's residence in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14<0x25> surge in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> surge in its population living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through several parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people with HIV in this way has decreased to nearly zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has increased to 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is called increasingly violent.
Due to the country's conservative value, studies estimate that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of the disease stem from unaffirmed sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that staff had leaked GOP senator data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
United States. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of its staff members had sent personal information of three U.S. Republican senators to the MP's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserted that the claim was moved by experts and the "ultra-right wing" website.
“T lies, lies, and many more false lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that the information released included the home address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information emerged online on Thursday, sent by unknown people at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of indecent sexual treatment of future Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak came shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the shipment were connected to the Waters office and uncovered information of one of the staff members of Waters, Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is absolutely wrong and is an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information, and safety are threatened by fraudulent and misdemeanor charges - are not at all responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is annoying," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows he doesn't fit into a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something that doesn't do it, they shouldn't be angry.
They can't stray.
They can't question the defendant's motives.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who accused critics of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to shift Waters in part-time elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the right authority and law enforcement entities regarding these misdemeanor charges.
"We will ensure that the perpetrator will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions for one and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Review Again - a parody of Rowan Atkinson's poor spy
Currently looking for Brexit significance in every new film with British bias views already being a tradition and it appears to apply to the reappearance of Johnny English's parody franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcasm insinuate about how bad we are to be a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, the eye-witness Johnny English has updated his license to mess things up for the second time – his name hints more than anything that he is a vast comic creation designed for a language cinema region other than English.
Obviously he is a crazy secret agent who, despite his strange assumptions, has little Clouseau character, a sequel to Mr Bean's character and an adventurer who contributed little note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In fact, he is indeed based on international travellers and mysterious men who Atkinson has played at the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, leaving chaos behind him.
There are one or two sweet moments on this latest JE trip.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter with medieval armor and rotor propeller quickly attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's prize for physical comedy was featured, but his humor felt less powerful and too strange, especially when the film brand "serious" such as 007 and Mission Impossible had been confident to include comedy as material.
His humor felt as if intended for children rather than adults, and for me the strange variety of Johnny English's uninnovative misadventures and the focus of Atkinson's films' jokes in Bean's personality.
The warm premise of these years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super secret British spy web network, uncovering the identity of all British agents on the pitch, to disappoint the agents in charge - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last opportunity for the arrogant and hostile prime minister, who had already destroyed his total politically popularity: Emma Thompson played an excellent role with the character quasi-Teresa-May but not much could be handled from the script.
His intelligent adviser gives the information that because every active spy has been weakened, he must bring a person out of retirement.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English himself, now employed as headmaster in some luxury buildings, but gives a secret lesson on how to perform disguise operations: there are some good jokes here, when English offers spy academies like the School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunited with an old friend who had been suffering for a long time, Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, escorting a submarine commander, a sucking top-class woman role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat eliminated.
So Batman and Robin make a mistake on His Majesty's Secret Agent back in action, meeting the mysterious beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is alarmingly falling under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous adventures: disguised as servants, they burn French fast-food restaurants; they make chaos by smuggling themselves on a luxury ship belonging to Volta; and English triggers anarchy when she tries to use Virtual Reality headsets to familiarize herself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are certainly drawn for the last sequence, but with such hospitality and excitement, there are few children's TV channels that contain about everything.
It's pretty moderate.
And just like other Johnny English films, I can't think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
Workers are planning a plan for British citizens to work four days a week but are paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labor Union considers a radical plan that wants British citizens to work four days a week - but is paid five days.
The union reportedly wants company owners to continue savings through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for workers by giving them extra holidays.
He will let the employees enjoy the weekend three days - but still get the same payout.
Some sources say that the idea will be 'pas' with the party's economic agenda and plans to encourage the country to support the workers.
The four-day shift a week has been approved by the British Congress of Trade as a way for workers to sense the benefits of economic change.
A source, senior of the Labor Union, told The Sunday Times: "A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
“This will not happen overnight, but four working days a week is an aspiration in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy that supports workers as well as the party’s industry strategy as a whole.”
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party had already promised four working days a week on the 2017 general election campaign.
However, these aspirations are currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “Four working days a week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to perfect his vision for the socialist revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from ‘anonymous directors' and ‘tutors' at utility companies.
This shadow chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in drinking water companies may not get back all of their shares because the government of the Labour party could do a 'reduction' on the grounds of perceived violations.
He also ensured his plans to put workers on the corporate board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, which would pocket annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views
FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his candidacy in the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raised questions as to whether the findings of this bureau could affect Republican senators to revoke their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators from the Republican Party, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find something that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seems to be more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the accusation appeared, and said, 'You did it?'
He is a strong, determined, firm man."
However, it seemed that Graham's voice would not be changed.
"My mind has made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but all I know is: Brett argues it hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned his name can't verify it.
He was 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What do you mean by the Global Citizen Festival and Is this Event Doing Something to Reduce Poverty?
On Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music show featuring a very impressive array of stars, and a mission that is also effective; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be a witness to tens of thousands of people coming flocking to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (unless you want to pay VIP tickets), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, calling, or other means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen for the past 12 years in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of giving gifts a free concert is the right way to invite people to do an action, or is it just another case called "clicktivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, encouraging to set other goals.
It said that this action has helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion that will influence more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By early 2018, the group had gathered 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, at least <0x24>10 billion of which had been channeled or fundraised.
The group estimates safe funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership consisting of investors and implementers committed to "help children grow to their maximum potential," promising to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end the country's nutritional deficiencies after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, contributors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustices about these nutritional deficiencies a footnote in history,” ambassador The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were made to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions in the General Answer <0x51>uestion on their website asking "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just like the great civil rights movement and anti-apartheid that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the stars performing at this year's show in New York, which will be guided by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "blockade" to inhibit Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could ask for the Navy's help to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspects that Russia’s involvement in Syria – in particular, where it operates on a legitimate government invitation – is a pretext to explore a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to be energy makers, just as they do in eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure the seaways open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot get into the market," he said.
Zinke spoke before the participants of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group calling himself the "energy customer voice" in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach in a deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
“The economic choices in Iran and Russia are more or less, harnessing and replacing fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as one of the “experts in that field” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as Trump’s government representatives are conducting a mission in order to increase their exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
Trump's administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline project "inappropriate", which Trump said, made Berlin a Moscow "major" joke.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 oil refinery project worth <0x24>11 billion, designed to double the capacity of the existing oil plant pipeline up to 110 billion cubic meters, is pure economic project.
The Kremlin denied that Washington’s tough resistance to the project was merely driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be used as a tool to put pressure on and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. attitude has drawn a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the U.S. not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a big problem if the third country mixes our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "watch the situation" while running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "watch the situation" while running for president after a part-time election.
While campaigning at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and improve our corrupt government, including putting women in the top position," he told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will observe the situation while running for president.”
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning at the town hall, saying that he "carried the region in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," he said.
Warren was blunt in delivering his criticism of Trump and future Supreme Court chair Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll released on Thursday, shows that most of Warren's own constituents do not want him to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts say it is better for senators not to run, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe polls.
32 percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running and 48 percent opposing him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party were discussed in connection with the possibility of running in 2020 including former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin during Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incidence of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son, what he's going to do when he comes back, I can connect with other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers have suffered," he said in front of the attendees present at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest such as "the elephant in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they came back slightly different, they came back harder, they returned and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and aviators and every other military member to the country."
She was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence violations against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and gun ownership in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports challenges to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and his son who was a ruthless gang member," had abused him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Grace's backing state prosecutors described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which resulted in large-scale asylum applicants for the U.S., as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy is backwards with the 2014 Immigration Appeals Council's decision to allow dark immigrants to flee domestic violence to file asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "regards existing state, federal, and international laws for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims should be decided based on certain facts and circumstances related to the claim, and such a ban violates the principle," a friend-of-the court brief said.
Further the prosecutors gave a brief opinion that policies that rejected immigrant entry were detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying that they would most likely be entrepreneurs and "suppose the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang cruelty.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fears caused by racial, religious, nationality, or membership issues in certain social groups, or political opinions," Sessions said in the announcement of this policy on June 11.
Relief is not meant to alleviate all problems -- although all problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue attempt in Palu as victims doubled while raced with time to find survivors
For those who survive, the situation is becoming more and more terrible.
"It feels very stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy's baby in a desperate refugee centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance comes carrying a body.
Clean water is very rare.”
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking in water-underwater items, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, the damage caused by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, was very chaotic.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a spinal and shoulder fracture, lay outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to a strong follow-up earthquake.
Her tears flowed as she recounted her feelings as the quake shook her fifth-floor hotel room where she stayed with her wife and daughter.
“You can’t save yourself.
I think I'm stuck in the wall ruins," Haris told the Associated Press, adding his family was in the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, then shut up.
I don’t know what it is and my son.
May they be safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'intimidating' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper loaded four-page ads in a U.S. daily calling the mutual profit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement on the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6, a charge disputed by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election, which marked what U.S. officials said to Reuters, was a new phase in the increase in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently entangled in an ever-increasing trade war, which makes them raise import tariff rates for each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa supporting the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime governor leading Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers, and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote an opinion on the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubling that intimidation by running propaganda ads in our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government harnesses the tradition of freedom of speech and press freedom that is highly valued in America by loading paid ads on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Instead, at street newspaper sales stalls here, in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and will not see an actual reflection on the different opinions that Chinese people may have on the troubled Chinese economic trajectory, given the media are under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent media declined an offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts warn, Republicans leave female voters ahead of part-time elections with Kavanaugh disaster
Due to the fact that important people in the standing Republican Party and defending potential Supreme Court leadership Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see a counterattack, especially from women, in the upcoming part-time elections.
Emotions over this issue were very high, and most Republicans were recorded already showing that they wanted to advance on the vote.
That’s unavoidable,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the urge of Senator Jeff Flake in the final minutes to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to ease anger on voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the Progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "November is near!" as they held a demonstration in the Senate aisle as the Republicans controlled the Justice Committee to continue advancing in Kavanaugh's candidacy regardless of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democracy's enthusiasm and motivation will come out of the list," non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
“People say it’s high enough; and that’s true.
But that could be even higher, especially among the female voters in the suburbs and the younger voters, 18 to 29, who because they dislike the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony which explained in detail sexual abuse against him by the Supreme Court's candidate, analysts advised there would be a counterattack that followed if the Republicans kept pushing him forward with confirmation.
"This is a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, told NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee election or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans deal with the issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of USA Priorities, a group that helps to vote for the Democratic Party, pointed to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be split about who to believe after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more favourable choice to the latter.
A new poll conducted by YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents actually believed or might believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they really believed or might believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or actually lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said something similar about Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as one other man, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh who was drunk had attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court’s candidate showed his shyness to him while they attended a party while they were attending college in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start a New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup trying to rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or PODs.
This storage can contain a list of contacts, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique of this personal online data storage is that it really depends on who users can access what kind of information.
In the company it is known as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of setting up Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company presents the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several staff developers contracted to work on projects, and a community of code-makers volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt websites.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a total change in which all their business models will actually be reversed overnight."
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt transmission is to provide energy and a commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet as he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the neutrality of network debate.
Even when it launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating the WW1 Victoria Cross
The only Church cleric in England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter, was commemorated in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, over an attack on the Bellenliese and Lehacourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was inaugurated by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "symbol of intelligence" stone that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's achievement winning the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-<0x51>uentin "through a very thick fog under a string of fires from field guns and machines."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with "the greatest courage" led the front line before rushing using field weapons alone and paralyzing three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was assassinated by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I knew I wouldn't be able to live but was a very humble act."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid bouquets after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feeled very proudly to play a role in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will be given."
MMA fans spend the night watching Bellator 206, but they even get Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've spent the night watching the crowded Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main show.
The bill from San Jose contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being aired live all night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., right when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to confront each other, the British audience was made stunned when his coverage turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they waited until a special early morning for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change to children's cartoon films as "annoying joke."
"This is a government regulation, that at 6 a.m. the content is not suitable for airing, so replaced with children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator's marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"He's a pig, yeah."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would improve their scheduling by taking into account future British audiences.
"I think if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," Coker said.
"But right now there at six a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of change, a lot of text is back and forth and everything is not educating.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We’re going to reduce up to five fights only from six fights – as we usually do – and we’ll try to avoid excessive screening for fans, and we’re successful.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'low self' related to sexuality issues
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with a low sense of self-esteem due to his sexuality problem - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize it until he entered high school, that “not everyone like me.”
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said, she spoke about the right of the homos to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not so concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual show bearer of this long-running event, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as those who were knocked out on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "less than" everyone else growing up with her because "it's not socially acceptable to like men and women."
“To this day, that feeling is less than the others, and a different feeling, has become the real things that give me the power and the power to succeed.”
She wants to prove that she is "something," she says, so she won't disappoint everyone when they know about her sexuality issues.
The Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known LGBT campaigner and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said he was in love with a man - a filmmaker from US Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "shocking me."
Daley was married to an Oscar-winning man who was 20 years older than this last year, and he said the age gap was not a problem.
"When you experience so many problems at a very young age" - he attended his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who had the same tides.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley saying "his whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than just winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had already got a ticket for the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'you won't sit in the front row of dad'," he said.
"I held her hand as she stopped breathing and still hadn't really stopped breathing until she died, I finally admitted that she was unbeatable," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd of people at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had already merged with him in his preparation for the Olympics and still made him chill.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed the role when it was proposed at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Mickelson will record Sunday as he plays the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to change roles to avoid unpleasant achievements.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event to record his 12th record, was proposed by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball game and a group of four on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, this five-time major winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on that range, in hopes of improving what has bothered him.
Never been the most straight golfer despite being at the top of his career, this 48-year-old was not fit to take a very tight course at Le Golf National, which routinely gave a long and rough sentence for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it is not scary enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, facing highly accurate English Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If these American golfers, starting 12 single games with four points below, starting with a hot start, then Mickelson’s game proved to be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understands his role today, pats his back and embraces me, and says he will be ready for tomorrow's game," Furyk said.
"He's so confident.
He was the Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can’t imagine he played two games.
I imagine the others, but that’s how they play and that’s the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup match, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that would never match the height of his individual record.
Mickelson bagged 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought some unsaid things to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's joking, likes to joke people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players have fun with him, this week as well, which is quite fun to see.
He gave me a lot, more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big advantage could disappear soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, learned from the experience that someone leading quite big to his last single game in the Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant trip.
Dane made his first debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, with team captain Sive Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over America, but had just touched the finish line with their nose with the thinest margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we got a big lead at Valderrama; we got a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only recently," said Bjorn, taking a picture, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will enter a really boring game.
Get out and do all the right things.
It’s not over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win this trophy, and that’s the focus.
I’ve been saying for a long time, I’ve focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re also very aware of what’s on the other side – the greatest players in the world.”
Glad to see the players play on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: “In this case I will never advance myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players are going forward, and this is a different thing to do.
It’s nice to be out there with a colleague when everything goes well, but if you’re out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer will be tested.
That’s the message you have to convey to all players, get the best out of yourself for tomorrow’s game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play better individually than they did as a pairing, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself had been at both ends of the last day of the big game, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending with a defeat as Europe did the "Wonder in Medina."
"I remember every one of those words," he said, answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, put his players together to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as quickly as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the momentum goes one way, it will give a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in the different ways we feel, you know, we're trying to do wonders tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the match against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players in the top spot.
"I went with a group of these people in this sort of order because I think I could close all the way," Bjorn said of his single choice.
New German warships suspended again
The newest German Navy escort ship should have begun to serve in 2014 to replace the old Cold War era warship, but the ship would not be there at least until next year due to its wrong system and rising costs, local media reported.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" assignment, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class bodyguard, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post shipment problem has disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships already ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come in place of an old Bremen-class escort ship.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar removers, infrareds, and acoustic keys.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it should have been possible to use the latest escort ship for two years away from its original port.
However, continuous delays meant this sophisticated warship - which was said to allow Germany to highlight its power abroad - would be worn out by the time it began to enter its time of duty, Die Zeit noted.
The poor F125 escort ship had been a news report last year, when the German Navy officially refused to assign the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship's maker after shipping.
Few reasons are known behind the return of the ship, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship useless if used for combat missions.
Software defects were crucial because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on the older Bremen-class warships.
It was also known that the ship's weight was excessive that would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add updating in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with a weight of 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as ships with similar classes used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to damaged hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including crew training - was also a problem.
It said it rose surprisingly to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) - rising from the beginning of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problem with which this new bodyguard ship has been so important given the latest warning as there has been a deterioration in German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee admitted that the Navy was actually "running the ship with spreading capabilities."
The official said over time the problem was growing, as old ships were no longer in use but no replacement ships were provided.
He regrets that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class bodyguards could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats secretly
New research was conducted at a plantation in the Scottish Highlands aimed at uncovering how bats use natural landscapes in their food hunting.
It is expected that these findings will provide new light on this unique flying mammal behavior and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common pipstrelle and sopran as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Voice experts who analyze all recordings will ensure the frequency of bat calls and which species does what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be made to create images on a scale of landscapes detailing their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes this result will uncover which area of habitat is most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are obtained from habitat management jobs such as pasturemaking and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout England has declined sharply in recent centuries.
These bats are threatened with development and development work affecting nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper hung to trap bats as well as chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
The bats are not blind.
However, due to his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes in terms of capturing prey.
They use advanced echo location techniques to find insects appropriately and barriers in their flying paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for treating more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is deeply concerned about bats.
It has ten trained experts, who routinely conduct surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only natural reserves on Threave plantations in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The plantation manager David Thompson said the plantation was a suitable area for bats.
"Here at Threave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
“We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so, the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
He stressed the importance of bat examination before performing maintenance inside the property, because unwittingly there was a possibility of the destruction of one maternal nest could kill up to 400 female bats and the young ones, which would probably destroy the entire local population.
The bat is protected and killed, harassing, or disturbing, or destroying its nest is an illegal act.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Conservation of Flesh Trust, has encouraged the general public to help.
He said: "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and for many of our species that we do not yet know how the fate of their populations is."
Ronaldo, who rejected rape claims, is preparing lawyers to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claims of himself a "fake news," and said that people "wanted to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who publishes the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was later alleged to have paid him by giving <0x24>375,000 to keep the shutdown regarding the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram live broadcast video to 142 million followers hours after the claim was reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo, denounced the report as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's a normal thing.
They wanted to be famous for calling my name, but it was part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they call a "report of suspicions in unacceptable areas of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said it would ask for compensation as "a substitute for moral loss in the amount corresponding to the weight of the offence, which may have been one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reportedly returning to the player's room, a place where he allegedly had raped him, according to a report filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a disappointing "good man" was just "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo confirmed that both of them had sex, but it was on the basis of mutual desire.
Mayorga also said he went to the police station and had done a vissum of his injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to resolve the matter outside the court because he felt "a fear of getting revenge" and feared "will be humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old said he is now trying to cancel the peace settlement because he is constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain ‘will regret forever’ for the loss of carmakers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added "about" Toyota, Britain has told the BBC that if Britain is out of the European Union without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays if there is no deal, would be detrimental to Brexit in terms of employment costs.
Factory in Burnaston - which makes Auris and Aventis production of Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90<0x25> were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My conviction is that if the UK exits the European Union at the end of March, we will see a cessation of production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed their concerns about its exit from the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what the automakers say is the risk of supply chain if there is no deal with Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run based on the "timely" production principle, with parts incoming every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for cars made according to orders.
If the UK exits the European Union without a deal on March 29, there may be a border disruption, which the industry says could lead to delays and lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company's representative said, and thus production would be discontinued.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May's plan for future relations with the European Union was "accredited appropriately to avoid border checks."
"We have to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only enjoy success at the moment, but for us to achieve this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence is not only from Toyota but other manufacturers as well, that we really have to be able to continue what has become a supply chain that has been going very well.”
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but which is clear in the long run, warns that adding costs will reduce factory competitiveness and will ultimately be detrimental in terms of job costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union manager of the Unite workers at the factory, said his members are already increasingly worried: "According to my experience, once this job is past, will never come back again.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have put forward a proper and reasonable plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House said
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with deputy attorney-general Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed back another week” as the bout of potential grand court-leader Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, relations between Trump and Russia's aides, as well as potential blocking justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire a deputy attorney general or not, which will jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record conversations with Trump and possibly ousting the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose for not" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again postponed to avoid clashes with a Senate judicial committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation over a claim against Kavanaugh, which subsequently delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week, I can see that putting it back to another good week as well as remembering the other things that happened in the grand court.
But let’s just look at it and I’ve always wanted to deliver the latest news to the press.”
Some journalists will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
The show host Chris Wallace asked him why.
Sanders said the rare meeting was not because of a dislike to TV journalists "who are trying to draw attention," though, he said: "I disagree with the fact that they are trying to draw attention."
He then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be improved.
"The president did more direct responses than the previous president," he added without mentioning evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting will still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We are trying more often to do it and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace a press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asked questions while leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or a press conference with visiting high officials.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show the reason, doing free and sometimes bizarre looks before journalists gather.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland over concerns over Brexit issues
The Secretary of Health has written a letter to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and hope they will still work here after Brexit issues.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months to Britain withdrawing from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to meeting the cost of filing a fixed status for EU citizens working in the transferred public service.
In his letter, Mr Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union regarding this withdrawal continue, approaching the expected decision this fall.
But the British government has also been ready for possible scenarios of no deal.
I know this must be very disturbing to you all.
That is why now I want to reaffirm how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleges from across the European Union, and others, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health care work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' backfield, Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on a 31-27 loss from Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the round ended.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," Reed said.
The coach and medical staff oxygenated Abercrombie on the edge of the field before putting it on the stretcher and taking it to further evaluate.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was already out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there have been no details about the type of injury experienced" and the Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this red-coated second-level student, was in his first season with the State of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five tackles on Saturday before coming out of the match, which made his total tackle during the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher materia fees when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher materia fees when they buy property in the UK, along with additional money that will be used to help homeless people according to the new Tory plan.
This step will withstand the speed of success of the Corbyn movement in attracting young voters
This increase in the fee will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year – to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subjected to higher materia beads as they buy properties in the UK - along with additional money to be used to help homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to hold back Jeremy Corbyn's pace of successful efforts in attracting young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high revenues.
The rising cost of maturation will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, along with additional money that encourages the Government’s efforts to combat asylum.
Additional costs - which are additional costs on the current cost of maturation, including higher levels introduced two years ago on second house purchases and home purchases for rent - can reach three percent.
The Treasury Department expects this movement to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of the newly built property in London was purchased by non-English residents, which led to a price rise and made it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to set his foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas of the country - usually in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for cuts in materai to help more young people have their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by buying land but not using it, and urged Ny May to ignore quotas for affordable homes to repair the UK’s “housing deterrents.”
Corbyn has announced a series of reform proposals in the field of attractive housing, including rental surveillance and ending the suspension of "without guilt".
He also wanted to empower the council to build new houses.
Mrs May said: “Last year I promised I would dedicate the prime minister’s office to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our burgeoning housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as overseas-based companies, to buy homes as easy as those of the UK who are already working hard.
For many people the dream of having a home becomes something very far away, and the indecent treatment of the homeless remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scottish team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "main ambition" was to be Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish player enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently ranked third in League One, a three-point difference from the top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to beat my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's him," Ross told Sportound, BBC Scotland.
"But I was big and often watched the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that attracted me to come back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland's manager before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he didn’t feel trembling following the trail of big names at the club that size, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities that are in this club, there is no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I'm probably just going to see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there."
Ross's career in team management was only three years, after some time as assistant boss at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coaching staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to third, and turned St Mirren from the relegation gap to the winner of the Championship title the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he has ever done during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably the crossroads I have to go through," he recalls when taking over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I’m fine, make a living in a reasonable way, and enjoy some reasonable things.
But playing can be difficult.
You have a lot to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels good.
I’ve always wanted to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable feeling I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The survey found that the right time to drink beer was at 17:30 on Saturday.
Summer waves have increased the revenue of pubs in the UK struggling to survive, but more pressure on restaurant networks.
The figures showed that pub groups and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: "The sun that glows and Britain's participation in the World Cup is longer than expected to mean, July will follow the same pattern as in June earlier, where pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants getting a hard hit.
The downturn in restaurant trade by 1.8 percent in June will worsen in July.
Sales of pubs and bars selling beverages have so far performed most strongly than those in restaurants that have dropped.
Pubs that sell food also suffer from the heat of the sun, though not as bad as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just come out for a drink.
Sales across pubs and bar managed to sell beverages rose 6.6 percent for this month, with those selling food down three percent."
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreational and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since April.
The weather and impact of large social events or sports remains the biggest factor that concerns market sales outside of the home.
It’s no wonder that restaurant groups continue to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales from year to year would be very painful over the cost pressure that is taking place.
A long summer shouldn’t come at the time the operators who sell food are having bad times, and the time will tell if the good enough temperatures we’ve already enjoyed in August will give us a little rest that’s needed.”
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a blockade on brand launches.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey revealed that one in five children - some of whom are still 11 years old - had a secret social media account that they hid from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the development of the "fake insta" page
This news has raised concerns that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "first" account to be shown to parents
One in five children - some of whom are still 11 years old - create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid development of "fake Instagram" accounts - a reference to photo sharing sites on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they were operating a "main" account that was already cleared to be shown to parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who finds her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site, finds a teenager who asks others to “my rape.”
Research conducted by the British Digital Awareness and the Principal Men's Conference" as well as the Women's Principal" (HMC) from independent schools, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep private accounts.
Head of HMC, Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing so many teenage children who are trying to create an online space that cannot be found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected into the Scottish Athletics board as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of managers.
Doyle is the most widely-marked Scottish track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who led the field of sports to benefit from his various international level experiences over the past few decades.
“Eilidh is highly respected across Scotland, England, and the world’s athletic community and we believe athletics in Scotland will get great benefits by bringing him into the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American athlete, who won a run of 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among his total four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC expert, is now unable to run after a moment's ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today I had a stroke a month ago.
I can't walk.
The doctor said it was only time that could determine if I could recover and to the extent of his recovery.
It is a very exhausting job to recover completely, learn back how to walk, and today perform a dexterity exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ads comparing mothers to cows have split opinions in the online world
Breast pump companies have split their opinions in the online world with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows being leached.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the world's first silent breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an advertisement inspired by joke music videos to show the freedom this new pump gives to express a mother.
Four mothers dancing in the barn containing cow straw followed a song that included lyrics like this: "Yes, I'm bleeding myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice this isn't a gum, this is my breast."
Continued with the refrain: "The pump is out, the pump is out, I feed them dear, the pump out, the pump out, the pump out, I bleed my lady's milk."
However, ads that have been published on the company’s Facebook page, have caused online controversy.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying this makes "horror" in the dairy industry.
“A very bad decision uses cows to advertise these products.
Just like us, cows also have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, unless their baby is stolen from them within a few days of giving birth.
Elvie's breast pump is very fitting inside BH breastfeeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "Trauma that is understandable is good for both mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have to take care of their baby?”
Another added: "An advertisement that is missing meaning."
Another person defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she found the song "funny."
“I think this is a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breastfeeding.
Racing makes me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy but I accept it as it is.
It's a genius product," someone wrote.
Others commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at oppressive mothers (often in their workplace or toilets) and who feel like "coffee."
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps embedded in their bras.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the insights of many women who blackmail breastfeeding women who say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely silent, without cables or tubes and fittings inside the breastfeeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, carry their baby, and even go out while blackmailing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is a viable pioneer product launched with convincing and provocative.
By equating the image between expressing women and cows we want to pump breast milk and all its obstacles, as well as showing it through a way of entertaining and fun with the full freedom presented by new pumps.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has been headlined.
In the London Fashion Week event, a mother with two children performed in the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Move Silently to Tent Tents in Texas Borderlands
The number of migrants detained is increasing even though the monthly border crossing is still unchanged, partly due to harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it difficult for the childcare with sponsors.
Essentially, most sponsors themselves are documentless immigrants, and are afraid of endangering their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save children.
The risk is rising in June, as the federal government announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households should submit fingerprints, and the data will be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in Immigration and Customs, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of displaced minors.
The board then ensures that 70 percent of those arrested have no criminal record history.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsorship group are in the country illegally, and most of them are evil aliens.
"We're going to hunt those people," said Mr. Albence.
Aiming to process children faster, officials introduced a new rule requiring some of them to appear in court within a month after being detained, not after 60 days, which became the previous standard, workers said.
Most of them appear through video conference calls, not directly, to apply their legal status cases to immigration judges.
Those who are deemed unfit to get help will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to be more anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape attempts, the workers' shelters and system reports received in recent months.
Lawyers say the concerns are rising in larger facilities such as Tornillo, whose signs are in a struggling child tend to be ignored, due to its size.
They said moving children to the camp town without providing enough time for them emotionally or saying goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the trauma that has been fought a lot.
Syria calls on 'inhabited troops' from the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces occupied Syria illegally, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and "would be dealt with by itself."
"They should withdraw immediately and without filing any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem confirmed that the "war on terror is almost finished" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than millions fleeing their homes.
He confirmed that Damascus will continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syria's territory" from terror groups and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, particularly training and affecting Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in war-torn territory.
Regarding the refugee's problems, Moualem insisted that they should return immediately, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading extraordinary fear" that drove the refugees away more and more.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
"They politicize what should be a complete humanitarian problem."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition was agreed to end the war.
UN diplomats said the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major stronghold of Idlib rebels has resulted in an opportunity to continue political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevents massive attacks from Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem asserted that the treaty had a "clear-time delay" and raised the hope that military action would target mujahids including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-<0x51>aeda, which "would have been destroyed."
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly hold the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to make the post-war Act for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem presented the Syrian government's participation requirements in the committee, affirming that panel work should be restricted "to review the latest articles of the Act," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Won the Second Period
According to the logic, Trump will win another general election in 2020 except, because many liberal audiences expect, prosecutions and scandals to end his presidency early.
No one doubted, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's premiere hour rating has increased more than double to 1.05 million and MSNBC nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers of the lead-watch, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" had peaked on cable TV rankings with as much as 3.5 million viewers on the night of the headlines.
"This is a passion that makes people interested in something that is not yet understood," said Neal Baer, ABC drama host "Designated Survivor," about cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol's devastating attack.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Snapping to Hollywood Boys" Club, has other theories.
He recalled taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he would give Trump the right to vote.
Why? He asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,' Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is a value of entertainment in a mess.
Of course, unlike any other TV show, the storyline that emerged from Washington could determine Roe v. Wade's future, whether the immigrant family could reunite and restore the global economy.
Switching from it, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
Nevertheless, not only are you a knowledgeable citizen at six o'clock you find yourself watching a panel of experts debating the use of Bob Woodward's "background" source for his book "Fear," wearing Paul Manafort's <0x24>15,000 camel leather bomber jacket.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario the same again.
"Part of the policy he did makes him the same as a reality show that entertains you every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's show scene players and daily storylines (selecting hostile to the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

Lots of money from the outside flooded the toughest part-time election competition in the White House
It is natural that Pennsylvania 17 gained a flood of money, thanks to the re-establishment of congressional districts that endorsed two petals in the same seat struggle.
The recently re-established district of Pittsburgh, filed for Conor Lamb of Rep. Democrats - who won seats in other districts through a special election last spring.
Lamb advanced against another map, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which overlaps with the new Pennsylvania district 17.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally sided with the Republican party.
Competition on Pennsylvania's new district 17 has resulted in a massive campaign fund between the financial side of the big party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in the March special overseen generalized election for the Congressional District of 18 Pennsylvania.
The seat has been occupied by Republican officials for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The politicians have a slightly higher Democratic party.
U.S. Balances Sentenced to El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Back
Diplomats ensure that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognize Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and booked hotels in Panama until partners expelled Trump’s Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to retrieve heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a department spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sentence was only considered against El Salvador, who had received some <0x24>140 million in aid from America in 2017, including for narcotics control, development support and economics.
The proposed punishment, which includes cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, will hurt the country of Central America and the rise in unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings took place, North American and Central American officials postponed high-level conferences focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up with the same meeting last year considered a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, high government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to continue, in order to effectively end the consideration of punishment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal the government made at the meeting, diplomats said.
And all three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing up a new tenure or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts close to government and also talked about this unclear situation.
The Story of Study
Another shocking story is Robert Mueller's special advisory report on Mr Trump's possible judicial barriers, which there is currently very important evidence in public records.
Mr Mueller’s report also discussed his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our general election.
When Congress moves hands, Mr Trump will be held accountable of himself, just as he prepares to go again in front of voters, and may end up being a jury of his partners.
That’s why there’s still a lot to do, and I don’t mean to suggest that the fall of Mr Trump’s administration is inevitable – or its equality in Europe.
There is a choice that we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we are fighting.
In 1938, German officials were ready to put a coup against Hitler, if only the West were against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed opportunities in avoiding the years of subsequent massacres.
The beginning of history centered along such a point of deviation, and an accelerated or delayed democratic march is inevitable.
Americans are facing some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees Mr Mueller's probe fate?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested to secretly record the president and argue that he is not worthy of serving the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was not true.
"How can we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite strong charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, will we vote part-time for Congress that will hold Trump's accountability?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse for a long time.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a table written in swastika.
By leaving that legacy on me, how do I lose hope about our future?”

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans feel optimistic ahead of match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, a win over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would strengthen their position to qualify for the European League Group.
Knee injury left central midfielder Graham Dorrans unable to perform in the first season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can take advantage of the result as a stepping stone to a bigger base.
"The point is great for us because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old.
"In this game we are sure to get something and go by bagging one point.
In the end, we might be able to do it but, according to us, the draw may be a fair result.
In the first half, they may perform better but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
On Thursday, this evening became another great European day.
We hope to be able to pocket three points even though it will be a difficult game because they have a good result in their last game, however, with the support of the backers behind us, I am sure we can continue to go forward and get positive results.
Last year, we had a tough time because of my injuries and changes at the club itself but at the moment there is very good hope at this club.
The squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good exercise.
Hopefully now we can grow, put the past behind us and achieve success."
She couldn’t sleep because of fear of her retirement savings.
Although it turned out that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, there were not many people discussing with their family members about it.
Approximately half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their partners.
Only 10 percent of them said they discussed this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there is no step to starting the discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it's time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your own family to provide care if you don’t inform your wishes first.
Discuss with your counselor and your family, where and how you get treatment, because your choice will mean very important in determining costs.
Engage your financial advisor: Your counselor can certainly provide you with his help in showing you how to pay for those costs.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that guarantee these costs or insured yourself with your wealth – as long as you have money.
Show your legitimate document: Face the challenging legal debate.
Demonstrate immediate power for your health care, namely someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are carried out by professional people when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, a power letter in terms of your finances should also be considered.
A trusted person to take care of all your financial decisions should you choose, other than to ensure your bill payments if you are unable to.
Always remember with every detail as little as possible: Just imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency health condition and on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer various questions about treatment and allergies?
Note such details so that you are ready to answer.
“Not only does finance play an important role, but who is the doctor handling it?” asked Martin.
"What kind of treatment?
Who will the dog be taken care of?
Prepare the plan.”
A man shot at a wind gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind rifle on his way home from a night party.
The 40s victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots hit his chest, stomach, and hand.
The shooting incident was described by officers as occurring around 02:30 BST, and is said to be "a random act."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
The injuries sustained by the victim were not life-threatening and a number of witnesses had been filed by police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis hit Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia on Friday, leaving at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to increase.
The disconnected communication made it difficult for officers to channel the help of information from Dongala County, a region north of the city of Palu that was located closer to the epicenter of an earthquake that hit with a 7.5-scale of Richter.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of main facts about the cities of Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the narrow end of the bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When earthquakes and tsunamis hit, the city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Dongala, meanwhile, is a district of more than 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
This district, which is an administrative region under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic outlook in South Sulawesi province is to find fish and grow crops, especially on the coast of Dongala.
However, the presence of nickel mining plays an important role in the province, although it is mostly centralized in Morowali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
Recorded in the past 100 years, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by a tsunami, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Control Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami and hundreds of homes in Dongala collapsed.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in western Dongala.
Seismicly, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and hence an earthquake will occur regularly.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that have hit the last few years are as follows:
In 2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a major earthquake, just off the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 lives along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the deaths were in Aceh.
2005: Late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes have also hit the western coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the southernmost island of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami on the southern coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
The death toll amounted to more than 1,100 people.
2010: One of the islands in the Mentawai archipelago, off Sumatra, was also hit by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, triggering a 10-metre-high tsunami that immediately struck dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya County, Aceh, also suffered a shallow earthquake and resulted in destruction, as well as panics from people remembered by the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
Although this time there was no potential tsunami, more than 100 people died due to the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, dubbed a tourist island, also suffered a massive earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of which on the north side of the island.
The quake struck thousands of buildings and while towed thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, a former governor of Alaska and a vice-president candidate, has been arrested on the pretext of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, blocking reports of domestic violence and countering arrest efforts, as a report released by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to police reports, when a woman's acquaintance attempted to call the police to report a alleged crime, she seized the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to the Mat-Su Prejudice Prisoner, with a <0x24>500 bailless fine, as reported by the KTU.
As news networks reported, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, as sure" when asked about his defence.
Palin faced three minor Class A violations, which could make him jail sentence for one year and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with Class B criminal charges, with a one-day prison sentence and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
For Palin, this criminal lawsuit is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her own mother, Sarah Palin, who contacted the police to make a report on the alleged attack.
The case is currently filed to the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was prosecuted for domestic violence, blocking reports of domestic violence crimes, and possession of firearms in a drunken state, which was also related to the incident.
Her boyfriend accused her of having cornered her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received condemnation from a veteran group for linking her son's violence with PTSD as a result of her duties during Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a powerful earthquake with at least 384 deaths.
An earthquake with a power of 7.5 Richter scale that could potentially trigger a tsunami has engulfed thousands of homes.
Electrical networks and communication connections are disconnected, as well as deaths are expected to continue to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake then hit central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show how horrible the moment of the disaster spread across social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the then town of Palu, when a tsunami broke the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terror attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in a terror attack in New York City, where eight people have been killed -- the sentence includes rare and has never been committed in a federal crime-related state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out an attack by crashing a truck he rented from Home Depot to pedestrians and cyclists on a bike track along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death sentence, prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" also caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of will to bring the death penalty, which was filed to the Southern District of New York.
Based on court documents, the two indictments allow to be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury landed Saipov with 22 indictments, including eight indictments of murder in launching a blackout, usually worn by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as allegations of violent acts and attempts to destroy motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "substantial planning and early ripening," as an image of Saipov's crimes committed with "bad, cruel, and savage."
It was revealed in a will statement, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has resulted in injury, danger, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims of the incident were Argentine tourists.
Counting a decade since the Southern District of New York dropped the last sentence.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, the accused of murdering two drug suppliers, was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
Execution of the last death sentence in New York federal court in 1953, was dropped on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple of husbands found guilty in the espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's pair was executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan's origin, showed no regrets as the day and month passed after the attack.
When asked by investigators, he said he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov also revealed to authorities that the attack he was inspired by a video of ISIS watched from his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked ISIS flags to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 indictments that were handed down to him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, expressed "clearly disappointed" against the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to execute the death rather than accept a guilty plea for life imprisonment without guarantee of liberation will only extend the trauma of those involved in the incident," Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defense team had appealed to prosecutors not to drop the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit negotiations, said Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for today's 'moving the people's lascars in protest actions at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics - because of one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested that they take part in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative group supporters, Peter Bone, told street action in Birmingham that Britain "should be out" right now if Farage only served as Brexit Secretary.
However, May's challenge in the reconciliation of his divided position has been underscored by supporters of the Remain Tories who joined in a separate protest denounced Brexit in the city.
The prime minister struggled to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to stay on its path despite amidst the attacks on Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
Allied countries stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach a deal with Brussels, despite having a bad backlash — and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to decide the choice between his proposed packages and ‘disambiguation’.
Bone told the mob Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of the Chequers.
His proposal, that Farage had to appoint colleagues to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If his responsibilities remain him, we'll be out now," he said.
Wellingborough's MP threw an extra: "I'm ready to stand in favor of Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
He said, while showing his opposition to the European Union: "We do not fight in the world war to be submissive.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the proposal that public opinion potentially caused changes since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the thinking of the British people has changed and wants a fixed condition, it's absolutely not true."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, presented to reporters: 'It's simple, I want to say: 'O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular among the public, whereas the Opposition will not vote for it, for reasons it is not popular with our party and our activists who are seriously down the road and make us elected in the first place.
Our request, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us."
Through a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister maintains their work when their promise is appropriate."
Farage said that political demonstrations should be respected in order to be able to "feel the heat" if they want to reject the 2016 referendum decision.
“The most valuable moment is the trust between us – our people – and our political group,” he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming to them that 'we're not going to pass you to do that.'
He added in a message to the enthusiastic community: "I want you to make our political group, who are preparing to deny Brexit, also feel the heat.
“We are moving the nation’s people who will win us in Brexit and will never give up until Britain is self-governing, self-governing, and proud.”
Meanwhile, the mob of Remainers moved through Birmingham before taking action in downtown for two hours.
The activists’ lineup appeared to widen the Tories Against Brexit banner after triggering its lineup this weekend.
A fellow in the Labour row, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the Conservative group over the security issues of their party applications when the conference opened.
"These people are the ones who told us that they could control the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of the anti-surgical border, in order to trade unlimited free in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a funny show.
There’s no good Brexit at all,” he added.
Warren plans to perform a 'serious breakdown' in presidential nominations
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "remove the presidential nomination" after the election moment in November.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic party declared its future at the town hall in western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently denounced President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, deputy chairman of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was already marked as Trump's opponent in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, which was held in the city hall format since Trump took office.
A participant asked him a question, whether there was a plan to run for president.
Warren replied that this is the right time for women to enter Washington's circle to restore our broken government, and that includes the time for women to take the top.
He was arrested for the shooting of Sims, the LSU player.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced the arrest of suspects of the shooting to cause the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. in an ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, where an identified man asked for help as seen in the footage.
Friday morning, 20-year-old Sims, was shot and found dead near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul, told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde at the time wanted to protect his friend and Simpson opened fire on him.
When interrogated, Simpson claimed to be at the scene of the matter, held firearms, and fired them at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without meaningful resistance and thrown into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player 6 feet 6 inches tall, growing up in Baton Rouge, that’s Sims’s figure, has played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 straight balls in each game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after the team conceded his victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear by the time Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in a qualifying event on Saturday that would bring orders for the Mercedes team to play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton as he retained his position in the first two turns and drew Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel became the first to drive into the pit and let Hamilton to move inside the density at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap afterwards and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued on his way after some chase action that showed Ferrari's driver's reluctance left the inside empty with the risk of holding up after a double move to survive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led on most of the races because he held back the turn of the tires to target quick completion and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth place.
He eventually got into the pit on the 44th lap but was unable to improve his move on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen finally took fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a true man who let me.
“The team has done an incredible job of having one two,” Hamilton said.
That's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday through his insistence, he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford on the allegations of sexual violence against future Justice General Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement delivered by Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, instead of commenting on what is going on in the senate showing people who were "bad and corrupt and dishonest."
"Something that can happen and the wonderful things that are happening during the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and greedy and dishonest," he said.
"When you saw the makeup and the leak and then they said "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, wait a minute.
What we leaked...No, we didn't leak it," he added, as a senatorial impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak was not from his office.
"I don't hide the charges of Dr. Ford's, I don't leak the story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it as secret as he requested."
But his refusal seemed unapproved by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of future Supreme Judges, who became accused of sexual abuse of three women, the president impressed the Democrats using charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power in various ways.
You see crime, greed, they don’t care who they hurt, which they have to walk for power and surveillance,” Mediaite said in a statement.
League Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants as he faced Dundee
Dundee Stars made up a Friday defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning a home game with a 5-3 score on Saturday.

Air Traffic Drivers Die to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers In Safe Aircraft From Earthquake
An air traffic driver in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the islands of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continued to shake the area and many were trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their safety, 21-year-old man Anthony Gunawan the Great refused to leave his post at a loud-rooted guerrilla at Sis Al Jufri Mutiara Airport, Palu.
He chose to survive to ensure the Air Batik Flight number 6321 which was at the time on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic guide tower as he felt the tower began to collapse.
He died afterwards in the hospital.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Aviation Navigation Service Organizer Johnhannes Sirait said his decision could save hundreds of lives, reports from ABC Australia news.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're all sad to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities feared the death toll could reach thousands after the National Disaster Treatment Agency delivered access to the city of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong was difficult.
"The victims are believed to continue to grow as many victims' bodies are still overlapping ruins and many others are unattainable," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho disaster relief agency.
The six-metre wave has made Palu a landslide that led to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carried aid and various supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a corpse.
Clean water is rare.
Minimarkets everywhere are looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia works hard to help the survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It has become a tragedy, but it may get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia earlier this year was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini delivers one person missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operated a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia saying one person had disappeared, having previously been delivered to 47 passengers and the crew had been evacuated safely from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini delivered at a release on Saturday afternoon, unable to identify a male passenger.
The airline said it had cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and examiners to find the man.
The airline did not respond quickly to requests for more detail about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crews, after the plane hit water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline delivered the remaining six passengers at the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the sequence of events in full is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. navy both stated the plane landed in the lagoon around the runway.
Several witnesses felt the plane went beyond the runway.
American citizen passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's really good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to traverse the waist-high water through the emergency exit on the sunken plane.
He delivered the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a little wound in the head.
The U.S. navy said fishermen working closely around the repaired docks also helped rescue using rubber boats to transport people to land before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 metres (100 ft) in water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate 111 people have died in a PNG-registered airline crash over the past two decades but not one involving Air Niugini.
Analysts anchored the timeline of night women who were burned alive
The prosecution of the incarceration took place on Saturday in a re-examination of a man accused of committing a life-threatening burn against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made an outline for the judges on how he used mobile phone recordings to gather the various movements committed by 29-year-old defendant <0x51>uinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to the previous defendant's statement, Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed the defendant's mobile phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in a Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "false, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency delivered by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Mobile phone recordings indicate they know each other within a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis sometimes removed Chambers' message, call and contact information from his phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would lead to the jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop spirit?
A group of hip hop trio wanted to challenge the genre's negative views by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who came from Bristol, claimed the hip hop movement was away from the origin of political messages and plagued social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop spirits popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent rise in the UK through several artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other black people?!
NY's babysitter demands a partner for attacking after sending a "rationalist" message
A New York babysitter demanded one spouse for having attacked discriminatoryly after receiving indirect messages from a complainant mother and stating that she was "the other black man."
The couple refused that they were considered racist, and considered it more like "violence."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anxiety when she realized that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black as she came on her first day of work in 2016.
"THE MAN'S HITAKKKKKK OF THE HITAM LIFE," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she instead sent it to Maurice's mistress, twice.
Upon realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice's mistress, stating that they issued a caregiver, who was an African-American mixed citizen, for having done an ugly job and he was more expecting Filipinos, according to the New York Post.
Mrs Maurice was paid for one day of her work and then returned to Uber.
Currently, Maurice demanded the couple pay compensation for the dismissal, and asked for compensation of around <0x24>350 a day for a period of six months, in exchange for a caregiver's work that he initially had to do, despite the absence of a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that," he told the Post on Sunday, then added "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple countered claims claiming they were racist, stating that Maurice's fired worker was a reason to do, they feared they could not trust him after offending him.
"My wife sent me something that she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been married to, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As wrapped in "corruption," Plasco said his wife just two months gave birth to her baby and was in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going to chase someone who's in such a situation?
That's not a good thing to do," the investment banker added.
While legal cases are still running, public opinion courts have carried out a quick condemnation of the couple on social media, blaming their attitudes and logic.
Paddington publishers worry readers will not be in touch with speaking bears, new newspapers revealed
His daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born not far after her book had been accepted, was explained in the letter. "It's very hard to just talk without knowing the position she went through, reading it first before publication.
It's very funny to know as we know about Paddington's great success."
Saying his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through the bookwriting of a child with a bear toy, who was very optimistic about the work he had been denied, he added the 60th anniversary of the publication of a book that felt "sweet bitter" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of the end of his success.
“He’s a pretty quiet person, and he’s not a proud person,” he said.
“But because Paddington means so much to him, it’s like you’ve got a child who’s got something: you’re proud of them even though it’s not your whole effort.
I think he looked at Paddington's success like that.
Although it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always gave praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her by phone
Upon landing, her daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors failed to save her.
"Nad made a calm call to convey it was really bad. that he was most likely not going to survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad that stated he would die within the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors have given to keep their heart beating slowly depleted and left the body system.
He had died sometime while the handling process took place and everything felt lethal.
I can only sit there and wait, understanding all this has been revealed.
I can’t cry, cry or cry because I’m in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold on to it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane along with other passengers - unaware of what she had gone through.
“No one knows about it,” he said.
“My head was bowed down and my tears continued to drip all the time.
It was very difficult to explain, but when I was on the flight I felt a sense of sympathy so deeply against Nad.
That she needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
Women who are grieving post cards to prevent suicide at bridges
Two women who lost their loved one try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be contacted for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened the atmosphere."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother, who was then 11, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried if there's going to be an ongoing effect."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there who you can approach and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit and keep quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed there was a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a big trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "It made a gap in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in uncertainty when the FBI begins its investigation
"I think, if we really get something like what he asks for - an investigation that is limited in time, limited in scope - we may be able to bring a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "broken" amid a shutdown of the council's ruling.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their disapproval is all due to time.
The legislative elections stayed five more weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans did poorly, they would become very weak in his chance to make the person they wanted to be elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush had contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through it met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors ‘shocked' under Kim
The number of people defecting from North Korea to South Korea has declined drastically since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's ministry's data, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs that people smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment on the public.
Most defectors from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier crossed than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treated defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forced them to return.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in the war - have been greatly increased in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on pending denuclearization negotiations.
This comes after a historic meeting in June between U.S. president Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of development since then.
“Without confidence in the U.S., there would be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, it would be impossible for us to unilaterally drop our weapons,” Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical," saying he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Opposition Party chairman Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said he did not fit temperamentally to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid thinking that if a woman performs like that, they'll say 'histeris'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and difficulty speaking when discussing about his family and his years during high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, saying the charges against him were "an absurd and coordinated character murder" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi expressed objections if he would try to claim if he was approved, and if Democrats gained more votes in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he as a Democrat he was concerned about the potential Kavanaugh ruling against the Health Service Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as a conservative justice wit.
In a hearing of office appointment, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overthrow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for someone hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to deal with it.
It was an ethical cascade, anger for months and years, and he couldn’t get out of it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person who was talking to her, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then he continued.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears were ejected as a way out of anger in part because he was essentially misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of the early work, in a man-dominated office, one time I cried with unexpressed rage, was my throat slammed by an older woman - a cold manager who I've always been a little scared - who dragged me to the ladder.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair outside the marriage on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Miss Schroeder, was very frustrated, understanding that there was no reason for himself not to run for president.
"That's not a well-thoughtful decision," he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There have been seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
One called it the "Snow Prince and the Seven Kurcaci."
Having been late in the campaign, he was left behind in fundraising, and so he swore he would not contest the election unless he managed to raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a fight that led to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to the man only gave him <0x24>250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
As he spoke announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overly dominated by emotions - thanks to those who supported him, frustrated with a system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - made it difficult to speak.
"You might think I'm too nervous," recalls Miss Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
“You’ll think that Kleenex is my sponsorship company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write in my nisan?
"He's crying?"
How U.S.-China trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening shots of trade competition between the U.S. and China are so deaf, and as the fight is still far from the word, the interstate rides may be profitable for Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, fired his first anniversary earlier this year by enacting taxes on China's key export goods including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
A very significant increase was imposed starting this week with new tariffs affecting goods worth <0x24>200 billion dollars (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively enacting a tax of half of all goods entering the U.S. through China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, recently enacting tariffs to five to ten percent on American goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has pleaded to equalize the U.S. one-on-one, and the world's second-largest economy will not change in the near future.
Inviting Washington to step down means following the will, but publicly giving up to the U.S. will be too embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards properly, the pressure of U.S. trade competition can positively support China in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can make conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries is actually more dangerous than what has been previously known," said Abigail Grace, a research fellow at Asia-focused Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria said it was ready for a voluntary refugee return and offered assistance to rebuild a country destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country improved.
"Today the situation on the pitch is more stable and safe thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government went on to rehabilitate areas that were destroyed by terrorists to restore them as it once again.
All conditions are now present due to the voluntary return of refugees to the country they must leave because of terrorism and a thorough economic decision that makes their daily lives and livelihoods a target.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive assistance to rebuild a devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive conditional help or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup defeating the U.S. Team with a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has never won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its cup as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who attempted almost throughout the tournament, hit his tee punch into the water on par-3 of the 16th hole, acknowledging his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari glows along his round, becoming 1 in 4 players who have been 5-0 since the format that took place in the tournament began in 1979.
American athlete Jordan Spieth was defeated 5<0x26>4 by the lowest-placed player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia of Spain became a European with an overall win with a career point of 25.5 in this tournament.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t hold it back today.
It's a tough year.
Thank you to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy, very happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help," Garcia said emotionally after the European win.
He gave his responsibilities to fellow stateman John Ram who beat the legendary U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The amazing pride I felt, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record of Ryder Cup career.
Strange statistics by one of the best players of all time, have won 14 major titles just under Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to get fairway with the exceptions of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these people, they're fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we made it difficult for Europe.
We're fighting.
Respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will step forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to pay respect.
We've lost a lot."
