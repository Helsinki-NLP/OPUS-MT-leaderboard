Rapid cumulative incidents of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incident of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom that confirm that, although its stages vary depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their readiness for a surge in COVID-19 patients that will require health care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the cluster of cases of pneumonia with unidentified etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the disease's causative agent was a new coronavirus now called acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80<0x25> of COVID-19 sufferers have mild illnesses, namely respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients recovering.
In about 14<0x25> of cases, COVID-19 develops into a heavier disease and requires hospital treatment, while 6<0x25> of other cases experience critical diseases that require intensive care.
Mortality of patients hospitalized as a result of COVID-19 is around 4<0x25>.
In this study, we reviewed the trends of cumulative incidents of COVID-19 countries of the European Union (EU/EEA) and the UK (UK) and compared them to incidents in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of current COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has undergone further geographical dissemination and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world today following the pandemic dynamics in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of March 5, Spitri et al. reported the first Europeans with confirmed COVID-19 cases based on the definition of WHO cases.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 on people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected across 30 EU/EEA countries and Great Britain (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with the date including, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases notified every country around the world is updated daily at 8:00 p.m. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as compare them to trends in Italy.
As a prevalence proxy of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidents of 14 days, so taking into account the natural journey of COVID-19, in every EU/EEA and UK countries, in the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present a cumulative number of cases notified every country until March 15, 2020 at 8.00 compared to Italian cases during the period of January 31 to March 2020.
Covid-19 trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The cumulative incident trends dated 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follow trends in Hubei Province (China) (Page 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, COVID-19 cumulative incidents began to rise around February 21, then rose sharply around February 28, 2020.
This trend is primarily driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show similar trends of COVID-19 cumulative incidents (additional ingredients).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period of January 31 to March 15, 2020.
The data highlighted that, up to March 15 at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases has risen rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the COVID-19 cumulative incident hinted that the pandemic increased at a comparable speed in all countries.
This is despite the differences in stages experienced by countries, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and the differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region explained the situation about 10<0x25> of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 cases received data in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA levels are only available for each 6<0x25> and 1<0x25> of cases (data is not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and death rates.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed a major variation in the availability of intensive care and care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenarios related to health care capacity saturation, with estimates of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases for each EU/EEA and UK countries associated with the risk of <0x3E>90<0x25> exceeding intensive care bed capacity, provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Because so far cases are classified in certain regions in the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a specific regional service coverage population, information about cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the Regional Unit Names level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very fast in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenarios and increase the number of COVID-19 patients that require health care, particularly intensive care, as occurred in the affected regions of Italy.
As shown in recent ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive, and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the transition from the inhibition approach to mitigation approach, due to the rapid increase in number of cases, as anticipated, may not give enough time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt to appropriate responses if it is not appropriate.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
A short window of opportunity is available when the country has the possibility to further improve its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA state health care system is likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more contagious and more about older people than young people, as well as more in men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about this emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly growing research subject.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope this review helps understanding and eradicating this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who are ordered to stay at home during the holidays and a few weeks later due to the outbreak of new viral diseases.
The virus is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) which caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease caused by it was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being returned and 3,000 patients dying.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "number 1 public enemy" and potentially damaging stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that stipulated viral sequences isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published about COVID-19, which include virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to summarize the progress of research in this rapidly growing new subject field.
Wherever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-induced diseases, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far on the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some other unanswered, but urgent questions.
Traditionally, CoV is considered a nonletal pathogen for humans, especially causing about 15<0x25> of cold 4.
However, in this century, we have found highly pathogenic CoVs for humans twice, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing outbreaks that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Because of this, COVID-19 is currently the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, an unknown pneumonia cluster was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, CoV sequences were launched.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemics spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, a health care provider infection was reported, signaling that human-to-human transmission may occur.
On 23 January, the quarantine of the territory was enacted in the city of Wuhan and the entire public transport was discontinued.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients contacted directly with the Wuhan seafood market considered the initial location of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time the report was written, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).
As the situation progresses very quickly, the final coverage and severity of the outbreak still must be set.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study in 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following more updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7<0x25>) of infected people are over 50 years of age, few are under 20 years of age, and only 14 are infected under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widespread in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
Covid-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from song to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time ranging from song to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive numbers (R0) are 3.77 (95<0x25> CI: 3.51-4.05) and custom R0 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, in accordance with the massive transportation time before the Spring Festival in China.
Patient mortality with confirmed cases of 1.44<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 1.10-1.86<0x25>) and custom mortality for all patients by 3.06<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 2.02-4.59<0x25>).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (men), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large subfamily of convoluted viruses that contain single strands of RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genuss, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein bulges or spikes (S) cover binds to its cell receptors, an angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the replication of the virus genome, the genomic RNA is accompanied by a cover glycoprotein and the nucleopaksid protein forms a vesicles containing virion, which then undergoes fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98<0x25> among 10 samples attributed; the sample was taken from the origin of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the epithelium section of the human respiratory tract that is very thin.
Human ACE2 is found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 protein binds to human ACE2 is weaker than its bond with SARS-CoV protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not as severe as SARS-CoV infections in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded with orf3b and a protein secreted with an orf8 password.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b proteins may play a role in viral pathogenicity and IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression inhibition; however, orf8 does not have a known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in complex with an amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that complexes, which have open and closed conformations, arranged forming dimers and ACE2-B0AT1 complexes can bind two S proteins, which become evidence for the introduction and CoV infection.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in therapeutic filtration of the drug to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother of origin and intermediary
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and are each transmitted to humans through mosquitoes and camels.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96<0x25> identical to two CoV-SARS-like CoVs of bats called bats-SSL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, intermediaries that help viruses cross the species barrier to infect humans are still unknown, and transmission routes still have to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposes snakes as carriers of viruses from bats to humans involving homologous recombination within S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that mills, long-sleeved mammals of ant eaters often used in traditional Chinese medicine, potentially as host intermediate SARS-CoV-2 based on 99<0x25> of genetic homology on CoV found in mills and SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1<0x25> of the differences spread throughout the genome are still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence are still unavailable (Gbr. 3).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40<0x25>-50<0x25> humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75<0x25> ethanol, disinfectant containing chlorine, persetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidin, effectively disabilizes the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can refer only to other previous CoV studies, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus is recognized by the innate immune system through a pattern identifier receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and type I (IFN) interferon synthesis that restrict the spread of the virus and accelerate the fagocytosis of antigen virus by macrophages.
However, N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune response.
Shortly thereafter, adaptive immune responses joined in the battle against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4<0x2B> cells and CD8<0x2B>, play an important role in this defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
The helper T cells produce proinflamatrix cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from already cured patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large number of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in worst scenarios, failure of compound organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by song cluster, is more about the elderly with inclusive disease and pregnant women.
Generally, people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is interrupted have a higher chance of infection than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, show that the incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so that it prevents infected people, but without symptoms, transmit the virus to others.
As a general practice, people exposed to the virus or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early COVID-19 symptom, with or without accompanying other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscular pain, stomach, headache, throat pain, rinorea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the illness.
In severe cases, the progression of the patient's disease progresses quickly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms and fever, even without lung imaging disorders, should be filtered against the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms were 98<0x25> for fever, 76<0x25> for dry cough, 55<0x25> for dyspnea, and 3<0x25> for diarrhea; 8<0x25> of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, a study on family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
Compared to that, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98<0x25>), dry cough (47<0x25>), and dyspnea (55<0x25>) as their main symptom.
However, 80<0x25> of patients need ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher MERS letality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26<0x25>) and throat pain (21<0x25>) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99<0x25>-100<0x25>), dry cough (29<0x25>-75<0x25>), dyspnea (40<0x25>-42<0x25>), diarrhea (20-25<0x25>), and throat pain (13-25<0x25>) are shown as the main symptom and ventilation support is required for about 14<0x25>-20<0x25> of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality by 2<0x25> with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 by 10<0x25> of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37<0x25> of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a trust interval (CI) of 95<0x25> by 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
The figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has higher spread capabilities than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as deadly as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Classes are often found in a family or from a group or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contacting an infected person or patient in the last two weeks before the song.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms over two weeks and patients returning from hospitals can bring the virus again. This raises alertness to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages, the patient has a peripheral white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes) normal or decreased.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, which includes lymphocyte count <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and increased levels of aminotransferase aspartate as well as virema were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The rate of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin increases in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and blood deposit rates increase in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels increase, namely fibrin decomposition products in the blood, and lymphocytes count decreases progressively.
The thoracic photo abnormalities were found in a large number of COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral cloudy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory Syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, tactical inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravates gas exchange disorders.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunctions lower surfactant levels and increase surface pressure so as to lower lung ability to expand and increase the risk of lung collapsing.
Therefore, the worst findings on thorax photos are often parallel to the most severe rate of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte descuation, the formation of the hialin membrane, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as many intimidated syntial cells in the patient's lungs who died of the disease, in accordance with pathology of viral infections and ARDS as well as similar to pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) is used as the main criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high level of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations begin to be used for diagnosis (which no longer only relies on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurs in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a must to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group explained the protocol of using the SHERLOCK-CRISPR-based technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects the synthesized SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input time) using a short time stamp.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if verified on clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with new CoV, doctors mainly offer supportive treatments to COVID-19 patients, as long as they try various therapies that have been used or proposed previously for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes current existing therapy and potential therapy with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from already cured patients is proposed for use in therapy.
The pharmaceutical company raced to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, which includes oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary shortcut technique used for the treatment of heart failure or life-threatening breathing.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organ functioning is also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by degeneration of the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that are the main causes of ARDS and failure of compound organs.
Immunosuppression is very important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storms include modulation of T-cell-directed immune responses; blocking of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; signal suppression of cytokine 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in SARS treatments to reduce the severity of inflammation.
However, steroids at high doses are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can result in severe side effects, particularly osteonectrosis, which greatly affect prognosis.
However, short corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are recommended to be given with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous remdesivir, an analogue of nucleotides, was found to be nutritious in a COVID-19 patient from the United States.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola virus and Marlburg.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition of other single strand RNA viruses, which included MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provides this compound for China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, melanavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side-effects can occur after combination therapy with melanavir/ritonavir.
This therapeutic interaction with other medications that patients use should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients who have healed and antibodies
There is a long history of the blood collection of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting the disease.
Indeed, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced B lymphocytes to fight pathogens as well as other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammatory and viral load as well as increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be done to file such methods for large-scale use before specific therapy is developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effect, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate the immune response excessively and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and plasma is needed in large quantities to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies quickly to fight the global epidemic is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from already cured patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or perform effective filtering of antibodies against proteins that are important to the virus.
This way, we can easily increase the production scale of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear as it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combinations.
Nowadays, because effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 has not yet existed, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe diseases.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and Lian Hua <0x51>ing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The top level of healing in COVID-19 patient therapy is observed in some provinces of China that use TCM in 87<0x25> of its patients, which include Gansu (63.7<0x25>), Ningxia (50<0x25>), and Hunan (50<0x25>), while Hubei province, which uses TCM only in about 30<0x25> of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest rate of recovery (13<0x25>).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of the patient, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues attributed a study comparing western medicinal therapy (WM) alone to combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, loss of symptoms, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
More impressive, the level of symptom hunting (from light to weight) was much lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4<0x25> compared to 46.2<0x25>) and mortality was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8<0x25> compared to 39<0x25>).
However, TCM's efficacy and security are still waiting for better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanism of work and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 feel very frightened of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and those quarantined also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Further, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as side effects of therapies such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to greater anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor turmoil, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality were once reported.
Tracking mandatory contact history and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and feel guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be provided to COVID-19 patients, the suspected person, and the person who contacted them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapeutic plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for dissolving the transmission chain from animal reservoirs and humans infected to vulnerable hosts and are often equipped with antiviral therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by the emergence of the virus.
Efforts have been made to develop an S protein-based vaccine, which is long-term and effective in making penetration and/or immunity antibodies that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live-deviced vaccines have been evaluated on experimental animals.
However, the efficacy of in vivo vaccine candidates in elderly and models of lethal challenges as well as its protection against zoonotic viral infections should still be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS dropped 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
Instead, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in the endemic regions.
The vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS by using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and has been partially evaluated on experimental animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to overcome due to a long time to develop the vaccine (an average of 18 months) and a dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical journey in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recuperate without sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the formation of the disease prognosis model is essential for the health care body to prioritize its services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
Covid-19 occurs primarily in the age of 30-65 with 47.7<0x25> of patients over the age of 50 in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who need intensive care tend to have comorbidities and complications as well as significantly older than patients who do not require intensive care (aged 66 years of age rather than 51), which signals age as a prognostic factor for the final outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000) than 0.27/100,000, as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: Covid-19 patients who require intensive care have more likely to have acute heart injuries and arrhythmia.
The heart event also highlights the main reason for death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to also bind to colangiocytes with ACE2-positive, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that the age and underlying diseases are highly correlated and can affect each other.
abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein levels (CRPs) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammatory or tissue injury and are proposed as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between CRP levels and severity and COVID-19 prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and creatin kinase (CK) can also help predict the final outcome.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Photos of thorax and development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the final outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are widely used as supportive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of the disease eventually suffer from avascular osteonectrosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer tremendous stress because they have to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be given to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of the infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the initial phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of viruses during daily activities, causing great difficulty to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when patients are severely ill and most do not occur in the early phase.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, major efforts are being made in China, which includes quarantines of Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as sustainable quarantines of nearly the entire population in the hope of cutting off SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
Although this action severely undermines the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients decreases, indicating an epidemic slowdown.
The most optimistic estimate states the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model for predicting the end result of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-conka usage and the patient’s throat that had recovered and returned home from the hospital 2 weeks earlier. This indicated that re-identified viruses could be repeated episodes, similar to influenza.
However, promising signs occur in China, if viewed based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may be successful.
Ebola is predicted to cause a million cases with half as well as deaths.
However, with quarantine and tight isolation, the disease can finally be controlled.
Perhaps also, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a virus not too pathogenic that can coexist with humans.
Comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also be through direct contact with virus-contaminated substances.
The virus is also found in the feces so that it raises the possibility of a new transmission, namely a feces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41<0x25> of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other diseases previously and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, appropriate precautions should be taken to protect people, particularly health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even people who happen to be in contact with patients or infected people.
The first defense line that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (the 1860s series number) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgery masks keep the surgical splashes of potentially infected people out of the air or stick to the surface of the material, where the surgical splashes can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virion by as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5<0x25> virion can merge fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can migrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, health care providers who contacted directly with the patient should wear N95 (serial number 1860s) instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate insulation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may enter his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear translucent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in the affected or potentially affected area, it is highly recommended for everyone to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home using self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
A three-foot distance is believed to be appropriate to keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a great reminder for China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on January 19, 2020, Wuhan’s director of the Centers for Disease Control calmed the population by saying that the new virus has low propagation properties and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and prevention and prevention of the disease is not a problem.
This message greatly calmed the fears of the people, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, so this critical time was too late to stem the still-sized disease in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agency should pick up lessons from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because each word is observed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) it is more sensitive and reactive to the information uncommon than to wait for an official report from a doctor or an authorized officer; (3) it is more restrictive to stem the potential of the epidemic at an early stage, and not to try to calm the public down; and (4) it is more often emitting out targeted and effective training.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to spread in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the outbreak has spread throughout China and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of writing this review.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has an effect like the SARS outbreak is repeated.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to stem the epidemic and deal with patients.
COVID-19 is more about older people than young people and more about men than women, as well as mortality rates are also higher in elderly people than in young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91<0x25> than 1.44<0x25>).
COVID-19 patients transmit viruses even when they are without symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit viruses when they are seriously ill. This makes it a greater difficulty in stemming the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains partly why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Asai RNA routine to check for SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured can give positive results again to the virus examination.
These findings greatly increase the risk of the spread of the virus.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues still have to be solved, namely:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although found genetic homology of 96<0x25> between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like CoV-SARS, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal becomes an intermediary species to transmit viruses from the native host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers number 1 and 2, we cannot effectively break the transmission and the outbreak can spread back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays show that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the respiratory tract cells and result in subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic take place?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic be a worldwide pandemic, end up like SARS, or repeat periodically like the flu?
The answer to the above questions and many other statements is very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, no matter what the price, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
The origin of the human coronavirus zoonotic
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its host, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as selema.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the state and reveals how severe and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoV a highlight back and surprise us with high transmissions, but with lower pathogenicity than its brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic. Therefore, understanding the origin of the HCoV zoonotic will benefit us.
Most HCoVs come from bats. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
Some HCoV intermediate reservoirs have also been known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Researching CoV-binding interactions in animals can also provide important insight into CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present a general picture of current knowledge of the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of its discovery as well as its zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast these HCoVs from the point of view of evolution and genome recombination.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, successful host transition requirements and the implications of viral evolution on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
The coronavirus (CoV) comes from the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of embroidered, positive, and single-stranded RNA viruses.
The virus has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobas between RNA viruses called "CoV", due to its crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar arrangement.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap each other. Both are translated into polyprotein replicas of pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open read frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which include bulges or spikes (S), sheaths or envelope (E), membranes (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
A number of complementary proteins specific to certain lineages are also synthesized by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified into four species (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four species, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoV and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of genes mostly alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while poultry is the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continuously crossed species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alfa-CoV.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the consemplating patient's innus in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been collected through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak occurs.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most damaging outbreaks in current history, which infects more than 8,000 people with roughly 10<0x25> mortality.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic dispersal to various other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), subsequently called SARS-CoV-2, is a causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm is already ringing and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins from bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of the evolution of all HCoVs of bats. In bats, CoV is well adapted and is nonpathogenic, but shows great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has raised tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
HCoV zoonotic tracking provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving power, and restriction factors for the occurrence of displacement between species.
The study can also guide or facilitate the search of reservoir host animals, intermediaries, and SARS-CoV-2 amplifiers, which have important implications for future spread prevention.
In this review, we provide a general overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlight and discuss the common topic that the HCoV parent virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but becomes pathogenic after transmission of interspecies to a new host.
We also review HCoV evolution trends that increased transmission capabilities are often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The final results of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic are also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the insulation of the first HCoV-229E strain B814 of the patient's infected innus, various CoVs had been isolated from various infected animals, which included turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV's discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative clue.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the patient's respiratory tract who had an upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed symptoms of congestion, which included headaches, sneezing, lethargy, and throat pain, accompanied by fever and cough seen in 10<0x7E>20<0x25> of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequence series paths in the still breastfeeding brain.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable to other respiratory tract pathogenic infections such as the influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread all over the world and tend to be most transmitted during winters in temperate areas.
Usually, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week and is followed by a period of pain for about 2 weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experience mild semen.
Few patients with weakened immune system show severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its ethiological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spread in many countries and continents.
Despite super spreaders, each case is expected to cause about two secondary cases, with incubation times of 4 to 7 days and the peak of the virus load visible on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced mialgia, headaches, fever, lethargy, and shivering, followed by dyspnea, cough, and respiratory disorders as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatin kinase is a laboratory abnormality that is common in SARS.
Damage to alveolar diffusion, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30<0x25> of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal tracts, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be deadly, particularly in patients whose immunity is weak.
The virus was first isolated from an open pulmonary biopsy of a relative of a zero patient traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially very common in young children, elderly, and patients whose immunity is weak to respiratory diseases.
Description of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are commonly found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same viral isolation from an 8-month-old male nasal specimen suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7<0x25> of general respiratory diseases and the peak of its occurrence occurs in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called clumps.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 are found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
These four HCoV communities have completely adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into a highly pathogenic disease. However, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, as in the case of HCoV-NL63 subtypes more virulent that have recently been reported to lead to severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Generally, when it gets the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself within humans, this virulent and pathogenic HCoV also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from 60-year-old patients with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed cases of laboratories come from the Middle East, import cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS clinical manifestations are similar to SARS clinical manifestations, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs in MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30<0x25> of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high case death of 34.4<0x25>, making MERS-CoV one of the scariest viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, the cluster of pneumonia patients who were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that an ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infections and is caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency as well as naming the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross case death toll of 3.4<0x25>.
It should be noted, case deaths in Hubei, China, were 4.2<0x25>, while case deaths outside Hubei were 1.2<0x25>.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a picture of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop quickly into acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of the homology of a high sequence of nucleotides, 82<0x25>, both group into different phylogenetic tree branches.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting equations and differences.
First, the incubation and duration of the course of HCoV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows another six HCoV general trend.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show a more common picture seen in Community HCoV infections, which include an overview of mild nonspecific symptoms or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infections even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows attractive pattern characteristics, having similarities to both community HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities are at least as high as community HCoV.
On the other hand, decreasing the lack of transmission capabilities of SARS-CoV-2 after some pathways in humans still need to be verified, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Lastly, just like any other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a feces sample.
"Whether fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, it should still be clarified by subsequent studies."
What is also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the HCoV community case.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 picture, which includes the ability of transmission, pathogenicity, and continued spread in some pathways in humans, will have a profound effect on the fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Four community HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
Seen from another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be a species of antiquity HCoV pandemic survivors.
HCoV that causes severe diseases in humans and people suffering from severe HCoV disease has been destroyed.
In order for this to happen, HCoV must replicate in humans in an adequate amount to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations to fight host restriction factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak survives and the more people are infected, the more likely this virus is to be fully adapted to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs circulated in the human population and triggered semen in people who were immunocompetent.
The virus does not require animal reservoirs.
On the other hand, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans and its transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
Both must defend themselves and reproduce in a zoonotic reservoir as well as seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or several intermediate hosts and amplifications.
SARS-CoV-2 has an image similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit like community HCoV, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and is not as pathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt fully to humans and circulate in humans without the host of reservoir or intermediary animals.
Before discussing the origins of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary host, natural, reservoir, intermediary, and HCoV prefixes.
Animals act as HCoV's evolutionary host if they have closely related ancestry and share high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
An ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is nonpathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir host carries HCoV continuously and for a long time.
In these two cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or the mother virus.
Conversely, if a new HCoV enters the intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters the human person, the virus has not yet adapted to a new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediary mother can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role as the host of the amplifier by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate, then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV can have an appendicitis infection if it is unable to maintain its transmission in an intermediary host.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to an intermediate host and even cause long-term endemics.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospectively that the case of zero SARS has a history of contact with constellation animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence research indicated that the animal seller had a higher IgG anti-SARS-CoV prevalence compared to the general population.
Moon mosquitoes (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market are the first to be identified carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is backed by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the insects in the market were killed.
Nevertheless, it is reported that the moon mosquitoes from wild or unexplained farms to the live animal market largely yield negative test results for SARS-CoV. This hints that the moon mossang may only act as the host of intermediary amplification, but not the natural SARS-CoV resorvoir.
It should be noted, since 80<0x25> of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that perhaps many small mammal species also serve as host of SARS-CoV intermediary amplification.
All of these hosts appear to be the late host of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV further revealed a closely related CoV bat, called CoV bat Rhinopus relative-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese horse bats.
These bats give positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and HKU3 SARSr-Rh-BatCoV genome sequences.
These CoV and other bats share 88-92<0x25> nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
The study is the foundation for a new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) are also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as live viruses.
The enzyme alternating angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known to be SARS-CoV receptors.
WIV1 derived from a sample of bat feces was shown using ACE2 bats, mosses, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, a convalescent SARS patient serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents an ancestor closest to SARS-CoV in bats, with a 95<0x25> homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not SARS-CoV's direct parent virus and bats are not SARS-CoV's direct reservoir host.
The phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoVs use the same host receptor, namely peptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as a viral entryway.
The sequences of RNA polymerase-dependent-RNA MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to its counterpart in beta-CoV bats identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats only share 87<0x25> of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Therefore, bats may not be MERS-CoV direct reservoir hosts.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab camels produce seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like Middle Eastern camels in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans is isolated from Arabic camel nasal sausages. This indicates further that camels are the actual reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with symptoms that are usually mildly observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Note, infected camels are spreading the virus not only through respiratory routes, but also through fecal-oral routes, which are also the main route of viral decay from bats.
However, the question remains unanswered because many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to symptom transmission, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2<0x25> nucleotide homology with the RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from the Rhinolophus bat affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are too large to establish parental relationships.
In other words, bats may not be SARS-CoV-2 direct reservoir hosts, unless nearly identical bat CoVs are found later on.
Most likely, SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal hosts exist among wildlife species sold and killed in Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are associated with this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences show that a group of small endangered mammals, known as trench (Manis javanica), may also carry an ancestor beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new CoV trench genome shares 85-92<0x25> of the homology of nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to RatG13 with an equivalent of 90<0x25> at the nucleotide sequence level.
Both are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like virus-like subarises in a phylogenetic tree, one sharing a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence equivalent of 97.4<0x25>.
The striking thing, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are much different, although the homology levels of sequences of the entire genome are higher.
Previous studies on the sick trench also reported detection of contig viruses from pulmonary samples, which turned out to also be related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different drafting methods and manual curations to produce partial genome sequences consisting of about 86.3<0x25> complete viral genomes.
We can’t rule out the possibility of a mill as one of the hostess of SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animals.
However, there is currently no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from the tremlin due to the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 grinding.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2's evolutionary pathways in bats, tre grinders, and other mammals still have to be set.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trellin, SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 share the highest homology at the sequencing level of the entire genome.
Too speculating if it is said that the high level of similarity between RBD beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 tremlin and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The matching hypothesis supports a recombination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 tremlin and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving factor, a lot of recombination occurs between beta-CoVs.
Researchers have yet to decide about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been researched.
phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from CoV bats, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that the bat CoV named ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American three-color bats showed close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to other bat CoVs, under the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae allegedly also being its intermediary host.
To be clearer, current knowledge of the origin of known HCoV animals is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of HCoV interspecies transmission in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 passed species from livestock to infect humans, there was a pandemic of respiratory infections.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E interspecies is not very clear.
Alfa-CoV bats associated with HCoV-229E have been found.
Among the two, there is alfa-CoV alpaka.
Some evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpaka, who may be in contact with bats in joint ecological loops.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpaka.
Secondly, the bat alpha-CoV associated with HCoV-229E has a variety of and nonpathogenic in bats, while alfa-CoV alpaka causes an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, alfa-CoV alpaka is not found in ferral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaka getting alpha-CoV relative-HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Other possibilities, while bat alpha-CoV serves as a shell of the HCoV-229E gene, Arabic alpaka and camel may serve as an intermediary host that transmits the virus to humans, exactly like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example for transmission of interspecies from bats to Arab camels and from Arabic camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV of bats is known to early identification of the virus and is also amplified with subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a rugged species of viruses rich for the exchange of interspecies genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long-lived, closely structured colonies, close social interactions, and strong flying capabilities, are all conditions that support bats to become the ideal 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in Arab camels for decades.
The virus has adapted to the camels that have changed from the host intermediate into a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans occurs by chance and humans remain the final host for MERS-CoV because the transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the camel's role in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the tre grinder, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, beta-CoV tre grinders are highly pathogenic in the tre grind.
The mill may be the final host for the beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2, similar to the weed in the SARS-CoV case.
In future studies, some possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animals to humans should be taken into account or ruled out.
First, bats may be a reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2 relatives viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, the tremlin could have been one of the intermediate host amplifiers for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
Humans get viruses through slaughter and consumption of hunted meat.
Perhaps, many mammals, which include pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies surveys of pets and wild animals need to be conducted.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in third species that contacts both bats and trench.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 animals is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors of the virus side are also important to facilitate CoV across species barriers.
First, its mutation rate is relatively high in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutations can be considered "present" to "high" with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 per year per site, depending on the CoV adaptation phase of new hosts.
CoV has an exoribonuclease of the correction, removal that results in very high mutability, athenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the Remdesivir nucleotide analogue is known to suppress CoV replication through this exobribunuclease inhibition and RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than the rate of its host mutation.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when CoV has not adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV which has a high mutation rate, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, signaling a higher level of adaptation with humans.
Likely, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV which has adapted to Arabic camels.
Theoretically, it is less likely that genetic drifting will quickly make vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 become ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the co-evolution probability of interspecies, which is favorable for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by the number of unique open read frames and protein functions encoded towards the end of the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replication through unique "chosen-translational" mechanisms.
In hosts that serve as mixing containers, strand transitions often occur during transcription of RNA CoV.
Complete and highly homologic RNAs can experience recombination to form a new CoV.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in CoV animals such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus-binding interactions in relation to transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, viral interactions with host receptors are other major factors that affect interspecies transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a special example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during the interspecies transmission event.
Based on the comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolate and mosquitoes, SARS-CoV is suspected to have rapid adaptations in various hostesses, particularly with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and is intensively targeted to host antibody responses.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its correceptor as a viral entryway.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, mosquitoes, rats, and raccoons, thus allowing transmission of interspecies viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed differently between human and mosquito virus isolates in RBD and 4 of which were located in the receptor binding motif for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV moisturizers have K479N and S487T mutations in their RBD, which may increase the affinity of bulging protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference of 30<0x25> between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S units implicates the affinity of S protein binding with human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed the affinity of human ACE2 bindings and S SARS-CoV-2 proteins 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV proteins.
What is also important to know is whether there are other correceptors that may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-terasetylated acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after transmission of interspecies from its animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the final result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also regulated by other host dependencies and restrictions.
The difference between these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arab camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoV must take over host dependence factors and break host restriction factors in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular determiner in the field of these important virus-like interactions must still be identified and characterised.
The whole genome filtration is unbiased to see the dependent and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 host using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The emergence of new HCoV: back to the beginning of the outbreak
The diversity of bats CoV provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoV.
In this case, CoV bats serve as a shell of the HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombinations also move the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein encoding gene could potentially drastically modify the viral phenotype.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adapting to humans due to the insulated relatives-SARS-CoV bat virus found to encode a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with the characteristic removal of 29 nucleotides found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal separates the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that supports the host's transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a recombination history with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV bloodlines, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partly nsp14.
Similarly, a recombination event between various lineages was shown to take place at the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed on other HCoVs where HCoV experiences recombination with other animal CoVs in its nonstructural genes.
Also be aware that artificial selection can play a role in the involuntary changes in the viral genome, most likely due to the release of the virus from the pressure of the selection experienced, such as the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 on the HCoV-229E prototype strain as a result of the removal of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed on bat and camel viruses that are closely related to HCoV-229E, alfa-CoV alpaka shows a single nucleotide insert that results in skeletal shifts.
Lastly, the new HCoV evolution was also driven by selective pressure on its reservoir host.
Light or no symptoms are detected when bats are infected with CoV, which shows mutual adaptation between CoV and bats.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoV anatomically and physiology.
For example, defects in the activation of proinflammatory responses in bats will efficiently lower CoV triggered pathology.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the increase in regulation of NKG2/CD94's natural killer cell receptors and low levels of histocompatibility primary class I molecule expression.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of high bat metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and affect the replication by exoribonuclease so as to pressure selection for the creation of highly pathogenic viral strains when it enters a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also develop through recombination, resulting in protein acquisition or new protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir host, such as bats and camels.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret of the presence of carriers without symptoms and the cause of severe cases in human infections.
Heavy symptoms are mainly due to the activation of excessive immune responses as well as cytokine storms, with increasingly severe lung damage if the immune response gets stronger.
On the contrary, in carriers without symptoms, the immune response is already detached from the replication of CoV.
The same strategy for deciding on the link between immune responses may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon responses are especially strong on bats.
Therefore, the delivery of type I interferon, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 in bats is effective.
For this reason, NLRP3's inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general flow of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV bats that share 95<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also CoV bats that share 96<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although mosquitoes and other animals in the market were found to carry viruses similar to SARS-CoV, direct intermediary hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.
Beta-CoV tre grinders that are very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 have been found, which suggests that the tre grind may play a role as one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV tre grinds may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still in question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by humans either intentionally or inadvertently.
CoV is again the center of attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoir for HCoV on human transmission.
Very much evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are from bats and are transmitted to humans through an intermediary host.
Given that SARS-CoV infections stem from contact between humans and mosquitoes in the wet market, it may be the closure of the wet market and the killing of all the mosquitoes in it that effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, the trench should be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-CoV linear lines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted to humans through trench and other mammals still need to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in Arabic camels.
It serves as an important transport tool as well as a major source for meat, milk, skin, and wool products for the local community.
The Arab insulation is widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we are unlikely to kill all camels to control MERS, as done in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop a vaccine for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we manage to eliminate this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause outbreaks.
Various zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, the potentially zoonotic bat CoV is very diverse.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience recombination, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are easier to transmit and/or more deadly for future humans.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and countermeasure plans should be applied.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet since ancient times.
These viruses are in its natural reservoir until there is an opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many features that support the spread of the virus, human chances of contacting bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from wild animals.
Sustainable surveys of mammals need to be done to better understand CoV ecology and its natural host, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that humans should keep away from the natural ecological reservoir loops of the zoonotic virus.
Some parts of SARS-CoV-2's zoonotic origin puzzles have not been found.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2's ancestral virus to the tre grinder, the condition when bats and ecological necklace sharing tre grinders is an important thing to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the human way of contacting bats should be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that plays a true intermediate host, the way the mammal interacts with other species, which includes humans, bats, and trench should be explained.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infections and surveillance should be performed.
Whether bats, tre grinders, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus can be identified in its natural host in the future.
Sustainable research in this field will outline the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updates of the diagnostic criteria of "the suspected case" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be carried out
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and handling of new coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to fight the pandemic around the world.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, the diagnosis and handling strategies are also being updated.
In this letter, we answer one of the comments in our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "the suspected case" and "confirmed case" based on the Diagnostic and Handling Guide for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is currently formally called the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus is named acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, it is worth noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, the diagnosis and handling strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example the Diagnosis and Handling Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with a portion of the context having been changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple score-giving proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their results add new evidence to our guide as well as a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support their significant work outcomes and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updates based on the latest Covid-19 Diagnosis and Handling Guide (the seventh version of the test) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm the suspected case required a combination of one of the epidemiological history images with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or required fulfillment of three clinical manifestations if there were no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to symptom; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients who have had fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and other regions of the community.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicates normal lymphocytes count, decreased, or decreased in the early song stage.
Diagnosing confirmed cases should be based on the suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a sequence of the entire virus genome shows high homogeneity for a new known coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM-specific antibody and IgG-specific antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in a test
We can see that real-time PCR test of nucleic acid in a sample of the respiratory tract or blood added in the second edition (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples was added in the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on ongoing research by researchers to look for optimal nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood intake, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the participation of certain positive antibodies into confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to watch out for patients with atypical symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. alir chart should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
Score systems also need to be verified in future clinical practices and studies.
As a cover, we hope more direct evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
For the diagnosis of "probable cases" and "confirmed cases", we advise to follow and comply with the latest guidelines in their respective countries.
Our team will also update our guide on a regular basis as assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest death toll in one day as a result of the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported the number of reported cases of infections including 114 active cases and 33 recovering cases living at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41-50 years old.
He also said two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Maitree's Kuwait Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obaidul <0x51>uader said public transport would be halted longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This public transportation cessation has begun since March 26 and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection incident recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8, on two people who had just returned from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three men had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed his first coronavirus infection and Zambia had his first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free from coronavirus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there are more than 244,000 cases of the coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Agency reported, which cited Johns Hopkins University's data, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by a coronavirus infection.
Worldwide, countries announce stricter measures to inhibit the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the quarantine of the region until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians would remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Parliament of Portugal conducted a vote to extend national emergency status for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstention votes, and one vote declined.
Saudi Arabia extended the evening hours in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina all day long; previously, the evening hours only took place between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement the evening clock between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until May 1.
Shops in Australia lower toilet tissue purchase limit per transaction
On Sundays and Saturday afternoons, Australia's Woolworth and Coles store networks each lowered the toilet tissue purchase limit of up to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at the national level.
The ALDI also implemented a one pack limit, on Monday.
This restriction was announced as a message on the cashier and on its network Facebook page.
Buyers reportedly accumulated supplies due to COVID-19 fears that people should conduct self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet tissue for delivery to home up to one pack per order.
These changes followed the restrictions of four packs per transaction that Woolworths and Coles had previously applied each on March 4 and 5 respectively.
In its media statement on March 8, Coles reported that by enacting the restrictions of the four packs, "many stores are still running out in an hour since the delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unpredictable".
Sales "stripped sharply" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco stores in Canberra also limited the amount allowed up to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered packing larger than suppliers and increased shipping frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Association, said that retailers were trying to increase supplies, but the limitations of local government bodies for truck delivery times made it difficult.
He anticipates a rise in production costs, as long as suppliers seek to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since it had released supplies early, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from <0x51>ueensland University of Technology, said the store filled supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet tissue is a large-volume item so that the amount of supplies is low and, if sold out, makes a lot of empty space on the shelves so that the scarcity of goods becomes increasingly felt.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there are a lot of items on the shelf, if products such as toilet tissue and satisfactory can be [buyed] and there are in large quantities, panic may be minimized, Russel Zimmerman said via ABC News Agency.
The manufacturer of Who Gives a Crap recycling toilet tissue said on Wednesday that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex Toilet Tissues, and Solaris Paper, which made Sorbent, stressed they work 24/7 to keep supply, according to News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet tissue to the first bidder auction in Melbourne, as fewer auctions were held as buyers took a break for a long holiday weekend Labor Day.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
The stores were actually reluctant to implement restrictions, according to an Australian ABC report on March 3, they said that they did not plan to implement purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, satisfies, dry foods, hand washing soap, and flour.
As well as outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon British online supermarket Ocado was observed to limit the purchase of Andres toilet tissue to two packs containing 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declares COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemy" only refers to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, the WHO noted the need to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change the journey of the pandemic.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and mobilizes its people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We are very vigilant both because of the level of dissemination and severity of concern as well as because of the level of inequality of alarming action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was "unprecedented."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "in addition to influenza, no respiratory tract virus has ever been tracked from its appearance to the ongoing global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we've never seen a controlled pandemic at the same time."
The new status of the pandemic follows WHO's decision in January that declared the outbreak a crisis of the world's troubling community.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "intensely, this outbreak will deteriorate."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) that is ongoing and caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a World Health Awareness on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have been healed.
The number of cases is estimated at 4<0x25> in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04<0x25> to 0.08<0x25> in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptom is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There are no known vaccines or specific antiviral treatments.
Main treatments are symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive actions include hand washing, shutting your mouth while coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and self-insulation for people suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by enacting travel restrictions, quarantines, evening hours, workplace hazard control, and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global economic social disruption, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports activities, and the extent of the scarcity of supply of goods compounded with panic purchases.
Schools and universities have been closed both at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation regarding the virus has spread online and there are incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with ancestry and appearances in East and Southeast Asia, and people coming from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of travel reductions and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the provincial capital of Hubei), reported cluster cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases are largely related to the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus and related to the bat coronavirus, a grinding coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no clear connection to the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial case cluster reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have links to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was probably the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, with new cases reportedly declining in China, but abruptly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has just surpassed in the number of the case.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, particularly among people with milder symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases were reported among youth, with people aged 19 and below making up 2.4<0x25> of cases worldwide. The head of UK scientific adviser Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60<0x25> of the British population needed to be infected before group immunity could be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been positively confirmed according to the official protocol.
As of March 23, no country has yet tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and many countries have made official policies to not test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, an estimated 86<0x25> of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infections for 79<0x25> of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be greater than reported cases.
Early estimates of basic reproductive numbers (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was likely 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who are not cured, the time from the development of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, up to February 5, about 80<0x25> of deaths occur in people over the age of 60 and 75<0x25> have pre-existing health disorders, which include cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official death count as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the deceased who gave positive test results for COVID according to the official protocol.
The actual mortality rate as a result of COVID-19 may be much higher, given the official figure may not include people who died without being tested, for example, at home, in care homes, etc.
Particular data from Italy found that the number of oversized deaths during the pandemic surpassed official COVID death calculations with 4-5-fold factors.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the number of deaths announced] it was lower than the actual figure", a statement reinforced by a non-indigent report on too low calculations in the U.S.. Too low calculations often appeared in the pandemic, as at the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death in Wuhan in 2009.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, in every continent, except Antarctica. In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This number varies by region and over time, as well as is influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time from the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to cases reflects the number of cases divided in a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the mortality ratio to cases globally was 6.0<0x25> (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
These numbers vary by region.
In China, the estimated mortality ratio to cases decreased from 17.3<0x25> (for people with symptom lyrics 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7<0x25> (for people with symptom lyric after 1 February 2020). Other measurements include case fatality figures (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed as a result of a particular disease, and the number of infection fatalities (IFRs), the percentages of those who are diagnosed
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population ranging from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of infection fatalities for the pandemic as a whole between 0.1<0x25> and 0.39<0x25>.
The upper limit of this forecast range is in line with the results of the first randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistic ensemble that analyzes the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO confirms that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end of the duration of this outbreak is unclear and may differ by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Without control, the infectious outbreaks are usually horizontal and then begin to decline as the disease runs out of hostesses available.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection right now about when it happens".
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "this outbreak may end June" if the entire country could be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene <0x26> Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly up to a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures would be needed "until vaccines are available (perhaps 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, can disappear completely" and the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Repeated virulencies will depend on the immunity of the group and the level of mutations.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecific and the infected person can be without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88<0x25>) and dry cough (68<0x25>).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory sputum (flegma), loss of smell power, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, throat pain, headaches, shivering, vomiting, hemoptosis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. The WHO states that about one in six people becomes severely ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, depressed chest or persistent chest pain, sudden confusion, walking difficulties, and bluishness on the face and lips; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms arise. Further development of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, respiratory syndrome, and lipitis;
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are close contact with the infected should be closely monitored and checked to ensure they are not infected.
Chinese estimated asymptomatic ratios range from some to 44<0x25>.
The incubation period (time between infections and symptom songs) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example uncertainty, the estimated number of COVID-19 sufferers who lose their initial smell energy is 30<0x25>, then decreased to 15<0x25>.
Details of the way the disease spreads are still being studied.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur mainly at close contact time and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that uncovered coughs can lead to pushable droplets 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate the virus may also be transmitted by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when speaking. Breathing droplets can also be produced when exhaling breath, including while speaking, although the virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplets may fall in the mouth or nose of a person nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make the respiratory secretion into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Dispersion can also occur when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
While there are concerns that the virus can spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government infects the possibility of a fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission.Virus is most contagious in the first three days after the symptom song, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and at the further stage of the disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before the symptom, which signals transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Few reports of laboratoryly confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmissions have been identified by several countries during a contact search investigation.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can last on the surface for hours to days.
Specifically, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities suggest washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may already have touched an infected person.
Coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with cluster cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All new SARS-CoV-2 virus features are associated with coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if exposed to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the initial SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus was genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B) along with two bat derivative strains.
The virus has a 96<0x25> similarity at the level of the entire genome with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference of amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between milling viruses and human viruses.
To date, the comparison of the entire genome found that there is a 92<0x25> genetic material similarity between the grinding coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the mill is the host intermediate SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by the virus can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately done through the reaction of the re-transkription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in the infected secretion or shynishes the imaging of CT.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtration or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, first distributed on January 17.
Testing using a real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is done on nasopharynx, but the use of the throat can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to be widely approved for their use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of radiographic imaging features and computed tomography (CT) in symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and no pleura effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is developing an international online database for imaging findings in confirmed cases.
Because it overlaps with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR unconfirmed imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as a filtration tool in the epidemic area.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
The strategy to prevent the spread of the disease includes keeping a comprehensive personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and wearing tissues while coughing or sneezing and directly throwing tissues into trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical restriction measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various regions have limited or threatened to stop all nonessential travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the level of community-scale deployment in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers who handle people who may be infected are advised to perform standard preventive measures, contact prevention measures, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by the government for this purpose has triggered privacy issues, with the release of statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on these types of surveillance.
A variety of mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user distance proximity to other mobile phones.
Subsequently, users will receive a message if they are close to someone tested positive for COVID-19.Understanding misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, rinse the nose and rinse with the fungus is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after from the toilet or when the hand looks dirty; before eating; as well as after penetrating the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This suggestion is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that damages its protective layer.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitation with alcohol content of at least 60<0x25> based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (in one minute exposure to disinfectant steel surfaces), including ethanol 62–71<0x25>, isopropanol 50–100<0x25>, sodium hypochlorite 0.1<0x25>, hydrogen peroxide 0.5<0x25>, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5<0x25>.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate chlorhexidin, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in public facilities, such as offices or childcare venues, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control, and ATM machines used by sufferers, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a bended elbow or use tissue when coughing or sneezing, and immediately remove tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and mileage of expiratory droplets scattered during speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and way of wearing masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using masks can reduce people's tendency to touch faces with hands that are not clean enough, which is a major source of transmission."Masker is also recommended to be worn by people who treat others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people who take care of COVID-19, although WHO also admits that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to push the use of masks to members of the community.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to a healthy society, especially when nearby (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned its people from going out to public places without wearing masks or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the toserba to wear a face mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear face masks while in public.
Taiwan, which produces ten million masks per day since mid-March, has required intercity train passengers and buses to wear face masks as of April 1.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time outside the home, as well as recommend making homemade face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restriction (also called physical restrictions) is an action of infection control intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social restriction methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social restriction methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping physical distance from others.
Today, many governments require or limit social restrictions in the affected areas of the plague.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations is quickly reduced, ranging from 250 people (if the spread of COVID-19 in a region is unknown) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Seniors and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and impaired immune systems that had the risk of serious disease and higher complications were advised by the CDC to be as much at home as possible in areas experiencing outbreaks at the public level. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term.
The use of the term "social restriction" gives the impression that people should isolate themselves entirely socially and not encourage people to stay in touch with others through alternative ways. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This recommendation includes the suggestion of having sex with only the person who lives with you and does not have viruses or virus symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct self-isolation. Many governments require or recommend self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions are issued for people who include high-risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with a wide spread of COVID-19 are advised to conduct a 14-day self-quarantine since the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategy in plague control is suppression or supremacy, as well as mitigation.
The dam is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected person and perform other measures for the control of infection and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease across the population.
When it is no longer possible to stem the spread of the disease, the next attempt shifts to the mitigation stage: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care systems and the public.
The combination of retardation and mitigation actions can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive numbers to less than 1. Part of the management of infectious disease outbreaks is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as hitting the epidemic curve.
This lowers the risk of being overwhelmed in healthcare and provides more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Nonpharmaceutical interventions to deal with outbreaks include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; measures at the level of society aimed at physical restrictions, such as closing schools and canceling mass meetings; community engagements to encourage acceptance and participation in these kinds of interventions; as well as measures at other levels of environments, such as cleaning of the curbing surface.
Other countries also implement various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass filtration and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who commit self-quarantine and impose a large fine on people who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished medical supplies stockpilers. Simulations for the United Kingdom and the United States showed that mitigation (slowing, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and supremacy (returning the growth of the epidemic) had great challenges.
The optimal mitigation policy can reduce the peak of demand for health care to 2/3 and deaths to half, but still results in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Suppression can be selected, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first to be achieved), because otherwise, the transmission will surge back rapidly when the suprepli measures are restarted.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have an impact on social and economics.
No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, which include existing drug testing.
Consuming free-selling flu medications, drinking enough water, and rest can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the condition of the patient.
Some previously approved compounds for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic step in responding to the outbreak.
The European ECDC and WHO regional offices have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible to cancel elective procedures, separate and isolate positive COVID-19 patients, as well as improve intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and bedtimers.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patients).
The first known new coronavirus case can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market, which also sells living animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A pneumonia cluster with unknown causes observed on December 26 and dealt with by Zhang Jixian doctor at Hubei Province Hospital, who told WuhanC
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital told their colleagues about "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for warnings he issued.
Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and informed the WHO.
<0x51>uite many unidentified cases of pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan who then triggered an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migrations during the New Year and because Wuhan was a major transport hub and train transit place.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one person in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest confirmed number of cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Region limited free movement and made border controls.
National responses include abstinence measures, such as quarantine (known as home residency orders, shelter orders, or quarantine regions) and evening hours. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90<0x25> of the population, are in a quarantine type of territory in the United States, over 50 million people quarantined regions in the Philippines, about 59 million people quarantined regions in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a regional quarantine condition, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 could be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report showed the earliest case on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 26; this observation was notified of his hospital to the Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
The announcement to the public was released by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
When this notice was carried out, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission from man to man.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later explained by Chinese Communist Party secretary general <0x58>i Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In a quarantine referred to as "the largest quarantine in human history", the sanitaire cordon or hygiene barrier was announced on January 23 to stop Wuhan's entry and exit journey, and expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
The celebration of the New Year (January 25) was cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Other hospitals were also built afterwards, Leishenshan Hospital, to deal with additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospital, China also transformed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government drafted further measures to curb the COVID-19 outbreak, including issue health declarations for tourists and extend the Spring Festival holidays.
All universities and schools in the country are also closed.
The areas of Hong Kong and Macau apply several steps, particularly in terms of schools and universities.
Steps to working remotely are applied in some areas of China.
Travel restrictions are imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public coverage was modified and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Control of public movements is applied in many cities, and it is estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) face some sort of restrictions outside the home. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent "importing" viruses from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international tourists entering the city. On March 23, the only case of mainland China was transmitted domestically five days earlier, in this case through a tourist returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the dissemination of cases transmitted domestically has essentially been blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China.
Travel restrictions on the same day are loosened in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the quarantine of the territory was enacted. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March onwards, without any specific details about the time this policy would end.
People who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
On March 30, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provide monetary stimulus packages for the company. The Council of State announced a day of mourning by starting three minutes of shutting down national creation on April 4 at 10:00, coincided with the <0x51>ingming Festival, although the central government asked the family to pay online respect by paying attention to physical restrictions to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
On January 20, 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China.
On February 20, the state health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to a meeting of new religious movements in Daegu, known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji adherents visiting Daegu from Wuhan are thought to be the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, among 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or about 13<0x25> have reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after testing confirmed that three positive soldiers were exposed to the virus.
Flight schedules are also affected and altered. South Korea introduces programs considered the world’s largest and best-organized program to filter viruses in populations, isolate each infected person, as well as track and quarantine people who contact them.
The filtering method includes obligations to report symptoms independently by people who come from abroad through mobile applications, lattatur virus testing or drive-thru with results available the following day, and an increase in testing capabilities of more than 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining the entire city. At first, South Korean society's views were divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for impeachment against President Moon over their claim that the government made a mistake in dealing with the outbreak, or vice versa, praising the president's reaction.
On March 23, South Korea reportedly had a total case of the lowest one day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that starting April 1, all new people coming from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received a request for viral testing assistance from 121 countries.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has asked that economic sanctions be reserved for countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The case began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China as well as declare emergencies.
Then, an unrelated COVID-19 case cluster was detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced new laws to stem the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.

A CNN report said that things that contribute to high mortality numbers are a combination of large Italian elderly populations and the inability to test everyone infected with the virus.
Initially, the UK’s response to the virus was one of the most vulnerable among the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not impose any social or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for being considered less responsive and less intense in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a call to stop all non-essential travel and social contacts and suggested that people work from home, if possible, as well as avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all recreational venues, such as pubs and fitness centers, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80<0x25> of workers' wages to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in a crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced stricter social restrictions measures, which prohibit meetings of more than two people and restrict travel and outdoor activities only for activities considered very important.

WHO praised China's government's efforts to manage and curb the epidemic.
The WHO noticed the difference between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of cover-ups so it hampered the prevention and suppression efforts and the current crisis with the central government "giving routine updates to avoid panic ahead of the holidays of Imlek's New Year".
On 23 January, in response to the central government's decision to implement a transportation ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that although the move was "clearly not a WHO recommendation," it was also "a very important indication for the commitment to stem the epidemic in which the outbreak was most concentrated" and it called it "unprecedented in the history of public health".
WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared because of the “global risk of spreading, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not have a well-informed health system.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to enact measures that interfere with international travel and trade unnecessaryly" as well as "WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement."
On February 5, the WHO called on the global community to contribute <0x24>675 million to be used to fund strategic readiness in low-income countries, while citing urgency to support countries that "have no system to detect people infected with the virus if the outbreak spreads."

In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergency program, warned that, “It’s time for every government on the planet to face the reality: Awake.
This virus may come to your place and you have to be ready," and urge that proper countermeasure measures can help the world avoid "the worst".
Further, Ryan stated that the current data does not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, as well as saying that such a declaration means "in essence we accept that every human on the planet will be exposed to the virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
WHO’s director-general said that WHO is “very concerned about the level of alarming dissemination and severity, as well as the level of inaction that is alarming.” WHO received spicy criticism for being judged to be inadequate in dealing with the pandemic, which includes delays in declaring public health emergencies and classifying the virus as a pandemic.

A number of provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed in connection with the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political institutions in dealing with outbreaks in the region.
Some commentators believe that this move is intended to protect Chinese Communist Party secretary-general <0x58>i Jinping from public outrage over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected earlier recognition of the coronavirus outbreak starting in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 coming from the US or Italy.
The U.S. government Donald Trump called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's cover-up action gives power to the virus that is now turning into a global pandemic." This word was ultimately criticized by a number of critics as racism and "removing attention from the failure of his administration in dealing with the coronavirus."
The Daily Beast gets a U.S. government message that outlines the communication strategy and clearly comes from the National Security Council, with a strategy cited as "Everything about China.
We were told to try and deliver this message in any way possible, including a press conference and performing on television."Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claimed that China's attempt to send aid to virus-affected countries was part of a propaganda push to influence the world.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geo-political component, which includes fighting to gain influence through the reverse of facts and 'politics of generosity'."
Borrell also said that, "China aggressively encourages the message that, unlike the US, they are responsible and reliable partners."
China also called for the US to revoke the sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, as well as reportedly sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.

On March 22, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed Russian soldiers to send military medical personnel, special disinfected vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous “high-level political source” as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was “no use or little for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of carrying out a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm attack.
Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo planes containing medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering aid to colleagues in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that if U.S. equipment manufacturers and medical materials get a chance, they will also be able to retaliate if necessary."
NATO’s “Defender 2020” military exercises planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary General Kate Hudson of the Nuclear Weapons Campaign criticized Defender's 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this exercise not only endangers the lives of U.S. troops and many European countries participating, but also the inhabitants of the country in which they operate."The Iranian government was severely impacted by this virus, with about two dozen former politically infected parliamentarians or five-members.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders to ask for help and said that his country had difficulty fighting outbreaks due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. This outbreak has prompted a call to the United States to adopt common social policy in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher grades.
Political analysts suspect it could negatively impact Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea are worsening due to this pandemic.
South Korea criticized the "ambiguous and passive Japanese quarantine effort" after Japan announced that every person coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-appointed location.
Initially, South Korean society’s views were divided on President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition, both calling for Moon's impeachment, based on their claims on government errors in handling the outbreak, as well as praising its response. The pandemic has allowed many countries to respond by passing emergency laws.
Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n, to rule through an indefinite decree, suspend parliaments and elections, as well as punishing people deemed to be spreading false information about the virus and handling the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus outbreak is tasked with a case of supply shortages, stemming from increased use of equipment globally to fight outbreaks, panic purchases, and disruption of factory operations and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increasing consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Some areas also experienced purchases due to panic resulting in emptiness of basic needs, such as food, toilet tissue, and bottled water, which triggered a lack of supply.
Specifically, the technology industry has warned about the delay in delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for self-protective devices has increased 100 times.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price as well as triggering a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
This also led to a shortage of self-protective tools around the world, and the WHO warned that this would harm health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in formula milk scarcity in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were spared from food shortages.
China and Italy's steps in countering the condensation and illegal trade of important products were successful so that the expected acute food shortages would take place in Europe and North America could be avoided.
North Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices can increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food racks were only temporarily found, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials removed pork reserves to ensure the nutritional adequateness of the community.
Similar laws also exist in Italy, requiring food manufacturers to store reserves for emergencies like this.
A global economic downturn has been felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, China’s economy was severely hit in the first two months of 2020 as a result of measures taken by the government to withstand the spread of the virus, and retail sales dropped by 20.5<0x25>.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the virus outbreak is thought to cause a major threat of destabilization to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the potential end result.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of an economic fall as a result of an epidemic on global growth could go beyond the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis said the outbreak had an impact of over <0x24>300 billion on the world supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to be "quarries" after petroleum prices fell sharply as a result of reduced demand from China.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indexes, which included the NASDA<0x51>-100, the S<0x26>P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded a sharp decline since 2008, with Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day decline since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
The three stock indexes closed the week with a drop of more than 10<0x25>.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed the Chinese government's credit rating, but retained the Negative Outlook.
Stocks are falling again due to concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest decline occurred on March 16.
Many people think economic recession may occur.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures of the central and state banks on time.
The central bank reacted faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the most severely impacted sectors due to travel bans, public places closures including tourist attractions, and government actions that restrict travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to at least demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and <0x51>antas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping line industry is at an unprecedented level.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season related to the holidays of Imlek New Year.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central and regional governments, including the annual New Year celebrations, and private companies also self-closed shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Imlek New Year events and tourist attractions are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities, and regions of China, authorities extended New Year's holidays until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to be reopened until that date.
These regions are producing 80<0x25> of the country's GDP and 90<0x25> exports.
Hong Kong increased the prevention of infectious diseases to the highest level and announced emergencies, closed schools until March, and canceled New Year celebrations. The retail sector was impacted globally due to a reduction in working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40<0x25>.
North American and Middle East retailers had a 50–60<0x25> decline.
This also resulted in a 33-43<0x25> drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Worldwide shopping center operators enact additional measures, such as sanitation improvements, thermal scanning installations to check buyer temperatures, and cancellations of events. According to estimates of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-caused recession can lead to people in extreme poverty in Latin America increasing between 14 and 22 million people compared to the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were displaced at home in the interior province or trapped in Hubei province. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates, the coronavirus outbreak can lead to a loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates can reach 32<0x25>. quarantine regions in India cause tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (payed through daily wages) unemployed. Surveys from Angus Reid Institute found that 44<0x25> of households in Canada experienced some sort of job loss. Nearly 900,000 workers lost jobs in Spain since their mid-term employment in Spain.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers filed for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers filed a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany filed a government-subsidized short-term work scheme for its employees, called Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Worldwide, the show art and cultural heritage sectors are impacted greatly by the pandemic, which affects the operation of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and independent.
Organizations of the arts and culture sectors seek to uphold their mission (which is often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to maintain the safety of employees and the community, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, show venues, and other cultural institutions closed indefinitely, with its exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or delayed.
In response, intensive efforts are deployed to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other adverse effects of the disease are the latest and very rapidly evolving are the cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, as well as fashion show.
The film industry was also disrupted. The Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome, which fell in the last week of the Preposterous Christian conversion season, was cancelled.
Many dioceses encourage Christian elders to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services via radio, online or television live broadcasts, while others offer drive-in or lantatur worship.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese as well as the vacancy of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and limited public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwara.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the plague and places of worship then closed, while Saudi Arabia banned entry of foreign pilgrims and its residents to holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant disruption to the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but it would not be more than summer 2021." Worldwide, casinos and other venues of the game are closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments are postponed or cancelled.
This led many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites reported a significant increase in new registration. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or canceling concert tours.
Many big theaters like Broadway also postponed all shows.
Artists explore various ways to continue to produce and share work through the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live live live online concerts or create web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many of the coronavirus-themed Internet memes are spread online with many people turning to humor and distract in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against Chinese and East Asian people, as well as against people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese deserve the virus or accept the things they claim as a reward.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination due to their area's origins.
There has been support for Chinese, both online and luring, and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the development of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to ban Chinese people from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan has become a trend on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist abuse and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", a term that critics consider to be racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, bordering China, and studying in major Indian cities are reportedly experiencing abuse related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "that's why God takes revenge on them."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "keliru".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Tionghoa residents were plagued by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign waste" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers using paid blocking have removed it for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make plague-related scientific papers available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share the results quickly on preprinted servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus respiratory diseases 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of viruses and which detect antibodies produced in response to infections.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed with RT-PCR, which detected the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 solely.
This test is used to confirm a new infection or is still active.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have contracted, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who are without symptoms.
The accurate mortality rate of the disease and the group's immunity rate in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, until March 2020, no country has had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests that countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the reported case fatality figure, which is most likely calculated too high in some countries.
Using a real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breathing samples obtained by various methods, including nasofaring or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed on sore throat is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
The virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for an infected person tested in the second week, the sample material can be taken from the deep breath channel by using a sucked catheter or material ejected through a cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charit<0xC3><0xA9>, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tool (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
The device seeks the "E" gene owned by all the coronavirus beta, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Product Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detecting tools. In the United States, the Center for Control and Prevention of Disease Control (Corization of Coronavirus)
One in three genetic tests in the old version test tools provided unconvincing results due to reagent errors, and the number of testing at CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that state laboratories and local laboratories were allowed to conduct testing.
The test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Usage Authorization. The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Similarly, <0x51>uest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
There is no limit to the quantity announced; collection and processing of specimens should be done in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed tests to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that could be done within 3.5 hours of high volume so that one machine could perform about 4,128 tests in 24 hours of time.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for testing that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Since it does not require a series of temperature change cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind new nucleocapsid (N protein) coronavirus proteins are being developed in Taiwan, in hopes of delivering results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid influenza test.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "thorax photographs have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, equivalent to the findings of CT [computed tomography] may have existed before the symptom."
Typical features on CT include bilateral ground-glass opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior.
The dominance of subpleuras, crazy paving, and consolidation is formed as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the current point of the pandemic's origin showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many overlapping imaging features with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtration or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19." In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial filtration.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infections in individuals since about 7 days after symptom rows, to determine the immunity against disease, and in population surveillance. Examination can be performed in the central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care testing (PoCT).
The automated system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this examination, but its availability will depend on the production level for each system.
For CLT, it is commonly used one peripheral blood specimen, although a series of specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, it is commonly used one peripheral blood specimen obtained through skin pricks.
Unlike PCR methods, extraction steps are not required before examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide notifications to agencies as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibodies tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA based on emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test tools that could detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
Its testing capacity is up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so it’s much faster than conventional PCR checks against viral RNAs.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the song of infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibodies test tools it purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong compiled a scheme for the suspected patient to stay at home, "an emergency emergency department will give a specimen tube to the patient," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results some time later. The British NHS announced that the NHS is pioneering a suspected case testing scheme at home thus eliminating the risk of infecting other patients if they come to the hospital or should be hospitalized.
The Lantatur testing center has helped South Korea conduct the fastest and widest testing compared to any country. On March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in a road safety order and 10,700 tests had been conducted in the previous week.
Costs are covered by health insurance if the test is requested by a doctor.
According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, landatur tests were offered in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples have been tested to and include weeks 12/20 and 33,491 samples (6.9<0x25>) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested methods for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and testing only further.
With its construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling shows that the case in Hubei could be 47<0x25> higher and the associated costs for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity did not exist.
Wuhan labs were soon followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity of 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 examinations. This balanced design can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid handling.
Until March, insufficient shortages and amounts of reagents have been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers attempted to explore sample setup protocols involving sample heating at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the United Arab Emirates reportedly conducted more coronavirus testing per capita population than any country, and was ready to increase the testing scale to reach most of the population.
This was achieved through a combination of landatur testing and the purchase of a population-scale mass result lab from Group 42 and BGI (based on the emergency detection laboratory "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory was able to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and was the first laboratory to have this scale outside China.
Various testing recipes targeting various parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German prescription for the production of test tools sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop on its own.
German recipes were published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control were not available until January 28, thus slowing testing available in the U.S.. At the beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States were problematic with the reliability of test tools; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test tools to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts testing.
Instead, experts say that the wide availability of testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the increase in the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus led to hundreds of thousands of testing waiting for work in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of obsolete tools and chemical reagents became fragile.
In March 2020, China reported a matter of accuracy on their test tools.
In the United States, a test tool developed by the CDC had a "disability"; the government then removed bureaucracy barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought test tools from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may be the result of failure in collecting samples or using test tools correctly.
The Spanish ministry said that they would pull equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with other test tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80<0x25> of the test tools the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test tools from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that this test tool be dumped into the Danube river. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test tool that Turkey bought from China had "high fault levels" and they did not "use it". Great Britain bought 3.5 million test tools from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test tool could not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine of positive tested people and tracking people who contacted positive people SARS-CoV-2, gave positive outcomes.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the first death site due to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing in the entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the positive tested people had no symptoms, and all cases were found in quarantine.
With travel restrictions to this community, new infections are completely eliminated.
With aggressive contact tracking, incoming travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than other developed countries despite no extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on time after the holiday on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with the pandemic with aggressive contact tracking, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with region quarantines that are not too aggressive, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower case fatality rate, probably because these countries were more capable of detecting people with mild symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "<0x25> positive results testing" column is affected by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people who are hospitalized will have a <0x25> higher positive outcome than a country that tests all its inhabitants, whether or not they show symptoms, with other factors the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning a person's hand aimed at removing dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal-oral routes.
People can also contract respiratory diseases, such as influenza or semen, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucosa membranes).
Five critical moments throughout the day that are very important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after urination, after cleaning your child’s ass or changing diapers, before igniting the child, before eating as well as before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of sick people.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child who has just been using the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal dirt.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing causes of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reduce the mortality rate of babies at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that increased hand washing practices could slightly increase the high growth of toddlers.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children due to respiratory and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate as a result of the disease by almost 50<0x25>.
Intervention that promotes hand washing can reduce the case of diarrhea to about one third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48<0x25> reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infection (ISPA), as a subconscious behavior performed at home, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the number one cause of the death of a toddler; the disease causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet into embedded habits can save more lives instead of any vaccine or medical action, as well as reducing deaths from diarrhea to nearly half and death from acute respiratory tract infections to a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined along with other sanitation measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects itself from impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
Small side effects of hand washing are hand washing that is often done can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause itching and scaly skin conditions, known as hand eczema or dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Hand washing is also often seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of the disease, namely: before and after using the toilet (water waste, urination), after cleaning your child's ass (replaced diapers), before feeding, before eating and/or preparing meat, fish, or raw poultry.
Another important time to apply proper hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of the disease is before and after treating the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching the animal's dirt or handling the animal; and after touching the litter.
In many countries, the level of hand washing with soap is still low.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7<0x25> of households were practicing hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest level with 23 percent. Now there are some behavioral changes methodologies to improve the adoption of hand washing behavior by soap.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of appropriate scaled action to support child health and education.
Giving a worm drug twice a year, coupled with washing your hands daily with soap and brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Cleaning microorganisms from the skin is reinforced by adding soap or detergent to water.
The main work of soap and detergent is to reduce barriers to solution and increase soluble power.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleaner because of fat and protein, which is a component of organic waste, is not easily soluble in water.
However, the cleaning of fats and proteins is assisted by sufficient water flow.
Soaps, due to their reusable nature, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies that examined the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps concluded that the transfer was unlikely due to the bacteria crossing with foam.
However, the CDC still stated "the liquid soap that it discharges from the container without touching hands is preferred."
Antibacterial soaps are strongly encouraged to health-conscious communities.
To date, there has been no evidence that recommended antiseptic or disinfectant use is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as tricklosan, which have a wide list of strains of resistant organisms.
So, even though antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective substances, advanced formulations can contain acids (acetate acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as active antimicrobial, and further skin conditioners (accounts, vitamins, menthols, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon’s Society’s antibacterial Health Faculty suggests that it is the same as savanthin.
Comfortable warm water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
Warm soap water is more effective than cold water soaping in removing natural oils that contain dirt and bacteria.
However, backwards with many people's beliefs, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hand.
Hand filtration or hand antiseptic is a water-based hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents were non-water-based alcohol rubers (also called alcohol-based hand rubbing, antiseptic hand rubbing, or hand sanitation) began to be known.
Most of these hygiene agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated along with thickening materials such as Carbonomer (acrylic acid polymers) into gels or along with humectans such as glycerin into liquids or foam to be easy to use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding hydrogen peroxide enhances further antimicrobial activity. Hand filtration containing at least 60-95<0x25> alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Smoked alcohol synthesis kills bacteria, bacteria resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol filtration containing 70<0x25> alcohol kills 99.97<0x25> (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibels reduction) bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99<0x25> to 99.99<0x25> (log reduction 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands 1 minute after use. Hand imaging is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitation is almost entirely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or alcohol scrubs in sufficient amounts should be used to weave or cover two hands thoroughly.
The front and back of the two hands as well as on the side and the tip of all the fingers is rubbed about 30 seconds to liquid, foam, or dry gel.
Finger tips should also be well washed by rubbing them in two palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of rubbing hands, especially when hands look dirty.
Increased use of diagnostic agents due to the ease of use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms; however, the diagnostic agents should not be used as a substitute for correct hand washing, except soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based hand filtration can often cause dry skin, unless emolient and/or skin moisturizer is added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused irritation and skin dryness to be much lower than antimicrobial soaps and detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive substances in alcohol hand rubbing are rare.
Lower tendencies cause disruptive contact dermatitis to be an attraction to this product than washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-water agents do not cleanse their hands from organic materials, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand cleansers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still in hand.
Alcohol-free hand satisfactory is highly dependent on its material and formulation, and, historically, this product is significantly worse performing than alcohol and alcohol scrubbers.
Recently, the formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy proved to be reduced after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects reactions.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to afford soap and use ash or land instead.
Abus or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a desinfectant agent because, if contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Correct hand washing techniques based on the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for disease prevention include the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water that flows.
Water flow is recommended because silent baskom may be contaminated, while water temperature does not seem to have an effect.
Apply your hands by rubbing them with a lot of soap, including the back of your hand, on the side of your fingertips, and under the nails.
Soaps lift germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more accurately when using soaps than when using water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubs longer removing more germs.
Squeeze carefully under the water flowing.
Splashing inside the baskom can make the hands contaminated again.
Dry it with a dry wipe or let it dry in the air.
Wet and moist hands are more easily contaminated again. The areas that are often missed are thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers, and under nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail paint can store microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep your hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate washing hands when tap water and/or soap is not available, for example, drain water from the jerigen or bottle hung and covered and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations when water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tipy-tap" and other options.
Tippy taps are simple technologies that use a water bottle hung with a rope, a leg-operated lever to pour a little water into the hands, and a soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
More and more studies have shown that paper laps are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper lap industry, to compare the hygiene levels of paper laps, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194<0x25> in finger books and 254<0x25> in palms.
Drying with jet air dryers causes an increase in the total number of bacteria on average 42<0x25> in finger books and 15<0x25> in palms.
After washing and drying hands with paper wipes, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76<0x25> in fingerbooks and 77<0x25> in the palms.The scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential cross-contamination in other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which emits air from the unit at an claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from hands and units and potentially pollute other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters.
The use of warm air hand dryers spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper lip showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Product und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After the drying of the hands, changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There are many hand dryers manufacturing, and hand dryers have been compared to drying by using paper laps.
Washing your hands by using a hand filtration tissue is an alternative during the journey if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitation should contain at least 60<0x25> alcohol.
Medical hand washing was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered his effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection decreased with the use of the device.
Medical hand washing is done for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in large quantities or gels to rinse and rub each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed against each other with fingers intertwined with each other.
If there is dirt under the nails, a feather brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in the water that is in the hand, hands need to be thoroughly rinsed and dried with a clean lap.
After drying, paper wipes are used to turn off the water tap (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids hand recontamination from the surface.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care order is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("cuman") and avoid their displacement.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing is still at an unacceptable rate in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patient so as to transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could lower catheter-related blood flow infection rates by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing hand washing standards and hand rubbing in the health care sector.
WHO’s hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be seen on its website for public comment.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of compliance with the rules is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for hand washing:
After being exposed to blood/ body fluids
before the aseptic task, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (a soap "medicine" or "antimicrobial") serves to kill hand washing materials.
The killing function may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations when antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To 'brush' hands before surgical surgery, a tap can be lit and turned off without touching, chlorhexidin or iodine washers, sterile laps to dry hands after washing, and sterile brushes to rub and other instruments to wash down.
All jewelry should be released.
This procedure requires washing your hands and lower arms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long period of scraping (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After washing the hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical robe are worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use hand filtration before and after handling the sick person.
For the control of staffiloccus infections in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand-cleaning came from the first 20<0x25> of washing, and that the additional benefits obtained were very few when the hand-cleaning frequency was increased above 35<0x25>.
Washing with regular soap results in more than triple the transmission of infection to food than washing with antibacterial soap. The comparison between rubbing hands with alcohol-based solutions and washing hands with antibacterial soaps with median time of 30 seconds shows that alcohol-based hand rubbing reduces the bacterial contamination 26<0x25> more than antibacterial soaps.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubbing to reduce the influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium spores difficile from hand. Intervention to improve hand hygiene in health care order can involve education for staff about hand washing, improving the availability of alcohol-based hand rubbing, and written and oral reminders to staff.
It takes more research to know the most effective interventions in various health care arrangements.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand washing facilities in residents' homes, schools, and workplaces makes a target for achieving universal hand washing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing taps near private toilets or common toilets are rare, although there are options for making cheap handwash spots.
However, low hand washing levels can also occur due to embedded habits and not due to lack of soap or water.
The urge and encouragement of hand washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and result in long-term changes in population behavior.
In order to operate effectively, surveillance and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that a community-based approach was effective in improving hand washing at LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of handwashing at school was the "Three Stars Approach" by UNICEF which prompted schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one star to finally to three stars.
Building a handwash can be part of a handwashing campaign done to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness improvement campaigns trying to achieve behavioral change goals. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of hand washing emojis.
Some studies have examined the effectiveness of the overall cost of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the prevention of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or year size lost from illness.
One review showed that encouraging hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective instead of water and other sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as newborn mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in the UK.
At the time, many people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, outbreaks transmitted through food and health-related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more actively drive hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries will be important to wash hands with soap to protect themselves from the infectious disease.
For example, the "right hand washing technique" poster was hung next to the hand washing sink in the public toilet as well as in the office and airport building toilets in Germany.
The expression "hand washing of" means expressing a person's reluctance to take responsibility for something or engage in something.
The expression comes from the Bible chapter in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed hands over the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins washing her hands continuously to clean imaginary stains; acts that show her guilt for the crimes she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or contemplating unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate more hand washing equipment.
Furthermore, people who were left to wash their hands after the contemplation had smaller impotence involved in the "cleaning" compensation action, such as volunteering.
Religion orders hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual washing hands in many religions, including the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> Faith, Hindu, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Jewish, Lavabo in particular Christian, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also orders washing of hands to act.
Hinduism, Jews, and Islam require hand washing after using the toilet.
In addition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam required hand washing before and after meals.
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of safety and work health methodologies for hazard control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper control of hazards at work depends on the location of work and job tasks, which is based on the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community, and the risk factors for each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure jobs have minimal employment contact with the public and other co-workers; for this job, basic infection prevention measures, which include hand washing, encourage workers to stay at home if hospitals, respiratory ethics, and perform routine cleaning and disinfection of work environments.
Employers at risk of exposure include jobs that require close or frequent contact with people who are unknown or suspected of suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission in an ongoing society or international travel.
The group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high volume retail order.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing protectors, and providing self-protective tools when meeting with COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers health workers and body rooms exposed to people known to or suspected of suffering from high exposure, which increases to a high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedure on, or take or handle specimens of, people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
This appropriate hazard control for workers includes engineering control, such as negative pressure ventilation chambers, and self-protective tools that fit job tasks.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of the type of goods requested or how to acquire these items (such as shopping outside busy hours, through delivery, or landatur).
Finally, the delivery of goods from highly impacted geographic areas of COVID-19 can be disrupted. Preparedness and plan to counteract infection disease can be used to guide protection measures.
Plans consider the level of risk associated with various workplaces and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the order of homes and communities, as well as risk factors for each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the controls necessary to address such risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and infectious disease prevention plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of outbreak prevention includes reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of disease in the community where business is affected by the countermeasures taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in safety and work health to group hazard control based on its effectiveness.
If the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and last self-protective tools.
Technical control includes isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in policy or work procedures that require the actions of workers or employers.
Self-protective tools (APDs) are considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of APD should be selected based on harm to workers, properly installed as applicable (e.g., respirators), worn consistently and correctly, examined, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk jobs have minimal job contacts with the public and other co-workers.
Recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent hand washing thoroughly, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics include covering coughs and sneezing, providing tissues and waste containers, preparing work remotely or shifting work with time of arrival/stage recovery, if necessary, informing workers not to use tools and equipment in other peoples, performing and cleaning and cleaning.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially transmitting individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have acute respiratory disease symptoms should stay at home until they are free from fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-lowering medications or other symptom-modifiers, and so that sick leave policies are flexible so that it allows employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and employees to know this policy.
According to OSHA, job-risk exposures include jobs that require close or frequent contacts within six feet (1.8 meters) of people who are unknown or suspected of suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the transmission in communities around the business location, or because a new person travels internationally to a location with a wide spread of COVID-19.
These groups include workers who have contact with the general public such as in school, working environments with high-population density, and high-volume retail-intensive, service-engineering, high-efficiency, high-efficiency, ventilation filters, installing physical barriers such as cylinder plastics, and installing drive-thru or tailor windows for the customer service of the group.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person falls ill on the plane, the proper control to protect employees and other passengers includes separating the sick person from another person by 6 feet away, appointing one cabin crew to take care of the sick person, and offering a face mask for the sick person or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear a once-used medical glove when caring for sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and perhaps other self-protective tools if the sick person has a fever, constant cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be dumped in a bio hazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial cruises, including yachts and other passenger ships, hazard control includes delaying travel if sick, isolate themselves, and inform medical centers on board immediately if a person has fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is carried out in the cabin of the isolated person. Despite the spread in the community, for schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is a transmission in society at a minimum to moderate level, social restriction strategies can be applied, which include: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating in cafeteria, increasing the distance between tables, time of arrival and gradual return, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with similar symptoms.
If there is a high transmission in local communities, in addition to social restriction strategies, extending school closures can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, direct health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with confirmed or suspected persons of COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-protective tools.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean up and disinfect belt and duty equipment before reused using spray or household cleaning laps and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of used APD as well as to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA assumes that certain health workers and body rooms are in the category of high or very high exposure risk.
High-risk jobs include providing health care, support, laboratories, and medical transport personnel exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This job becomes a very high risk of exposure if workers perform an aerosol-producing procedure on, or take or handle specimens of, patients known or suspected of COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, several procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimen intake.
The work of a high-risk body of exposure includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of a known or suspected person's case of COVID-19 at the time of death; this job becomes a very high risk of exposure if workers do autopsy. Additional engineering controls for this risk group include isolation space for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol-producing procedures are performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care arrangements and morgues.
Specimens should be dealt with with the prevention measures of Biological Safety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come are separated into different waiting rooms based on if they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of patients known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95-approved NIOSH or better face covering respirators should be used in the context of written and comprehensive respiratory protection programs that include suitability tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of workers. WHO does not recommend fully covered clothes or coverall because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO only recommends a surgical mask for screening officers at the entry point.
For people taking respiratory specimens, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shields, robes, and gloves.
If the aerosol-producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Given that APD supply is insufficient worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through long-distance medical services, physical barriers such as windows are translucent, with only people involved in direct treatment can enter a room containing COVID-19 patients, using only APD required for certain tasks, continuing to use the same respirator without relieving while treating many patients.

BARIS SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Relieves the load and prepares for the future
TANGGAL/WAKTU LIKE: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LISENSI: CC0: No rights are protected
We found ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a thing that makes clear the global human connection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the development of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we have witnessed among all colleagues through emails, calls, and chats is a tremendous validation of human existence, which we are fortunate enough to work with.
My gratitude and pride is infinitely able to call you all co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how strong it is for this important resource to remain online available to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site stays on, helps pay our colleagues, or helps to keep our community safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, especially at this time.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a meaningful impact for the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adaptation to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the right response to the challenges we face and the best way to maintain the organization's continuity during this time.
We are eager to eliminate pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, it’s okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don’t set a holiday, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to take care of your loved one, shop for the basic needs, or go to your doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don’t monitor your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn’t be said, but we say it.
A sick leave or a PTO is not required, just let your manager know and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that major work areas can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positively with COVID-19, please let Bryan know in T<0x26>C Ops so that T<0x26>C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the proper attention of management).
Fellows whose hour-based wages will be paid in full.
We have said it, and said it once more, in honor of our commitment to our contractor colleagues and clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal working hours when normal circumstances.
This includes if you’re sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way of channeling stress to the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are some jobs that have to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust <0x26> Security, as well as Fundraising teams, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We will start the process with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to support the essentials for our mission.
There’s a lot to do for all of us, we’ll just focus fully on the most important projects.
Slow down the moment will be nothing for the future.
We don’t plan to “work overtime chasing behind” after this pandemic passed.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet today’s unrealistic deadlines.
We realize that the situation is changing and will try to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP (Year Planning)?
To adapt to new reality and daily working hours expectations, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our goal is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make budgets so that employees can prioritize important jobs, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodateing those who need or want to work with fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline greatly reduces the workload and current planning pressure across the organization.
We will deliver our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegation and the team at the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, because it is very worried, we are hiring antivirus cleaning crews to disinfect all surfaces in San Francisco’s office.
They use hospital-class antiviral fluid to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all elevators that access our floor.
The building implements its own safety assurance protocol by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We were happy that the office would be ready to be worn when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all DC-based staff members.
As of last week, our DC office has moved into a full-range working order, in line with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we are also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked remotely for the first time.
Our long-distance colleagues realize that it may need adjustments and they want to advise you:
Limit the duration of the meeting for an hour or two.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into several days.
Define the meeting clearly, create an agenda, and send the previous reading material.
Make video by default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Show leaders to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor conversations for questions and record lists of speakers, and someone to help make meetings records (or do collaborative notes).
Send emails to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy small foods.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about the shared work
The SDM Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support increased work distributed across the Foundation.
Last week we asked all community grants recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO said the pandemic was over.
We inform them that we understand our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make them unlikely to complete approved granting activities and that no one will be penalized for having to delay or modify those targets.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, sentiments from all over the global community seem to be of grief as a result of this disorder, but at the same time are relieved of clarity and the ability to focus on its own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We will send invitations to your calendar for the upcoming Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for special staff meetings.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect with each other.
We are both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this email and all other COVID-19-related essential information in Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly impacted.
If you have any questions about travel, events, major workflows, or difficulties regarding coverage, or other things that may require help, do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and be a liaison as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of International SDM Global Operations.
No one of these changes is seen as neglecting our work and obligations.
Instead, this change is a recognition that, at present, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are the steps we believe it is important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support that our movement needs, and provide the world the service they rely on.
The work we previously planned will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for important work to come in the next few weeks and maybe a few months ahead.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!

b'Enzyme alternating angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell (membracing cells) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity as opposed to the angiotensin (ACE) conversion enzyme, by reducing the number of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a point of entry into the cell for some coronaviruses.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converter enzyme is a metaloenzyme containing zinc located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 proteins have terminal-N-M2 peptidase domains and amino acid transporter domains renal collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single type I-layer membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by other enzymes, known as sheddase, and the resulting solute protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes especially type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and vein endothel cells, and arterial plain muscle cells in most organs.
The expression mRNA ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stems.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the amino acid phenylalanine terminal carboksil from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-H-Pro).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into the cell for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (a virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (a virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of S1 proteins on spikes or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 bumps with the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomes located within the cell.
The process of entering the virus also requires priming S protein by serin protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesize that decreased ACE2 levels in cells may help combat infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE and ARB standard inhibitors therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34<0x25> decrease in pneumonia risk compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients with higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in mortality associated with pneumonia, although the results were less strongly compared to the overall risk of pneumonia."
ACE2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury, and appears to increase pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipoplisaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute working song in addition to the 24-hour length of effect.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation. RhACE2 infusions have been evaluated in clinical trials for treatment of acute respiratory syndrome.
The Covid-19 application is a mobile software application designed to help tracking contacts to cope with the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have made contact with infected people.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which have official government support in some areas and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are questionable, especially with regard to systems based on the tracking of the geographical location of the user of the application.
Alternatives that do not over infiltrate privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has spread applications that allow citizens to check if they have contacted COVID-19.
The app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, it is used an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopCorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health care authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still waiting for approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that contact tracking applications are in the advanced development stage and will be available to be disseminated within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur on application-based systems, which include false positives and likely lack of effectiveness if the data taken application is limited to a fraction of the population alone.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or dangerous “coronavirus” applications, Apple set limits on the type of organization that can add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store, which is limited only to “official” organizations or that have a good reputation.
Google and Amazon implement similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates voiced their concerns over the implications of mass surveillance using the coronavirus application, in particular as to whether surveillance infrastructures made to deal with the coronavirus pandemic would be halted after the threat passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
This organization states eight conditions on government projects:
surveillance shall be "in accordance with law, necessary, and proportional";
expansion of monitoring and surveillance should have a set sun clause;
the use of data must be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proven to be protected based on evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid the worsening of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with a third party must be defined in the law;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all "relevant stakeholders" are required, which include public health experts and marginalized groups. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address continuous surveillance issues by removing tracking mechanisms from the device's operating system after it is no longer necessary.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, and not applications, thus eliminating the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to conduct contact tracking.
Instead of using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications through text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the public, which is permitted with extensive changes to information privacy laws after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using centralized systems as well as systems that protect privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
Privacy-protecting contact tracking is an established concept, with a large number of research literature starting from at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is another coordination effort that contains a decentralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. Decentralized Protocols include Close Tracking that Protects decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly called Contacting Numbers, CEN Protocol, and CEN Protocol.
In this protocol, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
MIT Media Lab’s Privacy Group develops SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy while collecting and using location or groove intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar attempt is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was originally also established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officers without sacrificing the privacy of the data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have an approach that is essentially the same and is a protocol that many overlaps, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key aspect to achieving wide acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had created the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app to be open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also publish the core technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
The launch of tools to allow the government to create an official application of coronavirus tracking that protects privacy
The integration of this function directly to iOS and Android Google and Apple plans to address the problem of data retrieval and continuous surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates, then removing it in the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Reposition of the drug (also called a new purpose, new profile, or new task on medication or transition therapy) is the use of a drug that has been approved for the purpose of new treatment, i.e. for diseases or medical conditions that differ from the initial purpose of drug development.
It is a scientific research pathway currently underway to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be drug targets, each protein has several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these ligand binding sites can be the basis of an effective antiviral drug development project against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent polymerases, helixase, S protein, and ADP ribofosphatase.
Hussein A, et al, examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed the similarities of its skeleton with approved drugs and had the highest imperative to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in its preclinical study to be recommended in the design of clinical studies.
Chloroquin is an antimalarial drug that is also used against several autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that the associated chloroquine and hydrochloroquine were two of the four drugs to be researched as part of the Solidarity clinical trials.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that chloroquine and hydrochloroquine trials in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorised the use of hydrochloroquin sulfate and chloroquin phosphate based on the Authorization of Emergency Use (EUA).
The treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is authorised based on the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylactic or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
Doctors said they used the drug when "there was no other choice".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting security trials and the efficacy of preventive use of hydroxychloroquin.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravir proved "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were negatively tested in a 4-day median, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half the number of patients was given favipiravir and the other half received umufenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence to support the drug is not much and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for supplies and use the military to send drugs to university hospitals, where drugs would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in cases of severe diseases with viruses that have been multiplication.
This drug may not be safe if used by pregnant women or people who are trying to conceive.
A study of the melenavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antivirus and ritonavir, concluded that "there are no observed benefits".
The drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify drugs to find compounds that will bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteases.There are criticisms in the scientific community regarding the resource direction to reposition drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included the melanavir/ritonavir in international Solidarity trials.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several philo-, pneumo-, paramikos-, and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe illness and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies show that remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital, one for people with moderate illness and another for people with severe illness.
There are three clinical trials underway for intravenous vitamin C for people treated with inpatient and severe COVID-19 pain, namely two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York began a trial for azitromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of new coronavirus infection patients.
For a form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, Phase II trials are ongoing with 200 patients will be recruited from severe cases treated in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to find out the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently researching the role of caffeine in reducing inflammatory and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms so that it did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use effective contraceptive methods are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight Heparin is widely used to treat patients thus encouraging the Italian Drug Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study in 300 patients that examined the use of sodium enosopararin on prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, many scientific attention is focused on providing new medicinal purposes for antiviral drugs approved and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin is recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese guidelines 7th edition
Umifenovir: Umifenovir recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese guidelines of the 7th edition of China
Some antibiotics identified are potentially a drug that can be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by China.
In addition, trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
b'Vaccin COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there are many attempts are being made to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the disease, will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I security studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
Large outbreaks spread around the world in 2020, resulting in large investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop a vaccine that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that things to consider in developing the vaccine are speed, production capacity, spread on the scale needed, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI researchers reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets that progress to Phase I security studies, include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vectors (phase I developers and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vectors)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II tests performed early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually done randomly, placebo-controlled, and in some locations, while determining a more precise effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including the control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects on optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of them have not been in human evaluation (still in "practical" research).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of <0x51>ueensland announced that they are investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that will genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they are beginning to develop the vaccine, with human testing targets by 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they began developing the vaccine.
Janssen teamed up with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on vaccine design with technology similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.

in the development and development of vaccines.
Furthermore, the partnership announced a Phase I preclinical testing and clinical testing plan in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced they were working on 11 isolations, and even on a fast track, vaccine development took at least one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in <0x51>uebec City, <0x51>uebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with testing on humans planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered "'a large amount of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech, to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they will get the results of preclinical testing in April 2020 and vaccine candidates who are in the final stage can begin testing in humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Epidemic Preparatory Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced a US<0x24>4.9 million investment in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with a total CEPI investment in the development of COVID-19 vaccines reaching US29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and <0x51>ueensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun testing six vaccine candidates in animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing an RNA vaccine that can amplify themselves for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after receiving sequences from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a C<0x24>275 million fund for 96 medical countermeasure research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced a C<0x24>192 million fund dedicated to developing a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" containing some new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurred.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Faculty reported PittCoVac's testing, a candidate for COVID-19 vaccine, in rats; they stated that "MNA that provides S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines pose a specific response to the potential antigen antibody [in rats] that begins to look 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, governments, industries, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, also called nonspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
Further randomised trials in Australia are trying to follow 4,170 health officials.
There is a possibility that the vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the efficacy of the vaccine using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, showed the need for retention measures to achieve biological safety level 3 in dealing with living viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, no drug or protective vaccine for SARS has been proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. In addition, proven vaccines for MERS have not yet existed.
When MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine ( DNA-based) that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines were in the process, all of which were virus-vectored vaccines, two adenovirus-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-MAVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts outcry conspiracy theories claiming the virus behind COVID-19 have been known before and that the vaccine has been available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell power, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to symptom is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and failure of compound organs.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus mainly spreads among humans when close contact, often through small sparks or droplets produced through coughs, sneezes, or while speaking.
Although produced when exhaling, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious to long distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can last up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after the symptom song, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and after the next stage of the disease. The standard diagnosis method is with a reaction of a real-time transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) on nasopharynal use.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and the person who treats it.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be without symptoms or experience symptoms such as flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or chest tightness that is constantly, confusion, difficulty waking up, and the face or bluish lips; medical stretching is immediately advised if these symptoms arise.
Top respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, sneezing, or throat pain can be found, but are more rare.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in diverse percentages.
Some cases in China were originally only with a clinical picture of chest tightness and palpitation.
In some people, the disease can develop into pneumonia, failure of compound organs, and death.
This time is called incubation.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5<0x25> of people with symptoms will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The report shows that not all people infected experience symptoms.
The role of these symptomless carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is unknown and are being investigated, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20<0x25> of all confirmed cases remain without symptoms during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include symptomless cases in its daily case on April 1; out of 166 infections on the day, 130 cases (78<0x25>) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry the charge of the virus on a large scale.
Talking aloud releases more sparks or droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can cause droplets pushed up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is usually not transmitted through air, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air collectors placed in the aisle outside of people's room produce positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make the respiratory secretion into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the feces, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptoms; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can last on the surface for hours to days.
Specifically, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on cardboard/cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polipropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99<0x25> copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly; soap products decipher the protective fat layer of the virus, deactivate the virus, and free it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate chlorhexidin (surgical disinfectants), were less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in median two days after hospitalization began.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral charge, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral charge on the second day testing.
Coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with cluster cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features are present in the coronary coronavirus that is closely related to nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CoV.
Paru is the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the enzyme alternating angiotensin 2 (ACE2), the most abundant in type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike or bump" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was found in 12<0x25> of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe diseases.
High levels of cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial injuries may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in heart function.
Incidents of thrombosis (31<0x25>) and high venous thromboembolism (25<0x25>) were found in patients with COVID-19 infections in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsy in people who died of COVID-19 found damage to diffuse alveolar (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF cells have been shown to correlate with monocyte recruitment that secrete severe IL-6 inflammatory and pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphosic infiltrates were also reported on autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is a real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on breathing samples obtained through nasopharynx; however, a nasal or sputum sample can also be used.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but requires two blood samples taken at a distance of two weeks so that the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can develop testing of polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) independently to detect infections by the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if someone has been infected previously) were in development, but have not been widely used.
China's experience with the test showed its accuracy of only 60 to 70<0x25>.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnosis guidelines released by the Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical picture and epidemiological risks.
Bilateral ground-glass capacity with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distributions is found at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septum thickening with varying alveolar filling), and consolidation can arise as the disease progresses.
Little data is available about microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings on autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of severe pneumonia viruses can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammatory with lymphocytic infiltration, and many intuitive giant cell formation
Heavy pneumonia: damage to the alveolar diffus (DAD) with exudate alveolar diffus.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory Syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in the healing stage: exudate arrangement in the alveolar cavity and interstitial fibrosis of pulmonary pulmonary
Blood: intravascular coagulation disseminated (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing your mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends the use of the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Appropriate hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings from fabrics in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. Social restriction strategies aim to reduce contact of people infected with many, by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
The restriction guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
There is no known effective cure to prevent COVID-19. Since the anticipated vaccine has not existed until early 2021, the main part in dealing with COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as a "draw curve".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after from the toilet or when the hand looks dirty, before eating, as well as after penetrating the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitation that contains at least 60<0x25> alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand sanitation is not available, WHO provides two formulas for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as humektan.
People are treated with support care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they carry the virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure problems, but its benefits are still considered.
Self-hygiene and lifestyle as well as a healthy diet is recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive care may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for dealing with hospitalized COVID-19 sufferers.
Intensive care experts and pulmonary experts in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions into free resources, namely the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there has been no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (asetaminofen) rather than ibuprofen for first line use.
Preventive measures should be taken to minimize the risk of viral transmission, especially in the order of health care when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health workers who care for COVID-19 sufferers, the CDC recommends putting the person in the Tular-Air Infection Insulation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard preventive measures, contact prevention measures, and tular-air prevention measures.
Recommended equipment are: APD robes, respirators or face masks, eye protectives, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not facial masks) are better.
The N95 respirant is approved for industrial order, but the FDA has authorised this mask for use based on the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
The N95 respirant is designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unnamed use on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends to use face protectors or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not too heavy until it requires mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are indeed heavy.
Types of respiratory support for people who experience respiratory failure related to COVID-19 are being actively researched for inpatient people, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal canula or bipositive airflow pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods produce the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal canulas. More severe cases occur in elderly people over 60 years of age, and especially people over 80 years of age.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limit the capacity of the health system to deal with a sudden surge in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5<0x25> entered intensive care units, 2.3<0x25> needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4<0x25> died.
In China, about 30<0x25> of people with COVID-19 treated inpatients eventually enter the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
High pressure control mode and PEEP are required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pulmonary injury and ventilator-related pneumothorax.
High PEEPs may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take up to 2021, some of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with severe diseases.
The WHO’s recommended volunteers participated in the effectiveness and security trials of potential treatments. The FDA has given temporary authorization for convalent plasma as an experimental treatment in the case of a person’s life is highly or immediately threatened.
The convalescent plasma has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to prove its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also informs local health officials. Makadata analytics on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people who contact them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile data of people suspected of contracting coronavirus.
The move was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who may be in contact with infected citizens.
Additionally, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed aggregate phone location data to the German federal government body, Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was told mobile operators that "40<0x25> of residents still continue to move places".
The German government carried out a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience pressure due to quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic deterioration is the perfect storm that endangers mental health and community well-being."
The disease can be mild with little or no symptoms, which resembles other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as colds.
Light cases usually heal within two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infections based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severe affected person, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or compound organ failure.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, particularly increased protrombin time, were observed in 6<0x25> of COVID-19 patients treated inpatients, while kidney function abnormalities were seen in 4<0x25> of this group.
Approximately 20-30<0x25> of people with the picture of COVID-19 showed an increase in liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between symptom and death is ten days, with five days spent in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between inpatient and death.
In a study that examined early cases, the median time ranging from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8<0x25>, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7<0x25>.
Histopathological examination of postmortem pulmonary samples showed alveolar diffuse damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Cytopathic changes of the virus are observed in pneumocytes.
The pulmonary image resembles acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8<0x25> of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was observed, with an increase in troponin levels or heart stops.
According to March data from the United States, 89<0x25> of hospitalized people have innate conditions. The availability of medical and social resources of an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality of conditions vary due to differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Lack of light case counting can cause the death rate to be calculated too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases that took place in the past can mean the current mortality figures are counted too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms and are about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. There are concerns about the long-term sequela of the disease.
Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a 20<0x25> to 30<0x25> decrease in pulmonary capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-care-intensive syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not yet known if the previous infection provides an effective and long-term immunity to people who are recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen to be obtained, if it looks at other coronavirus behaviors, but there have been reported cases of COVID-19 recovery followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days later.
The case is believed to be a deteriorating remaining infection, and not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and originates from animals, through a spread infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infections is almost entirely driven by the transmission of humans to humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest symptom song date was December 1, 2019.
Official publication of the WHO reported the earliest symptom song on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, as well as are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the WHO set the ICD-10 emergency U07.1 disease code for deaths due to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and U07.2 for deaths due to clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio of deaths to cases reflects the number of deaths in the case of a clinically diagnosed or epidemiological diagnosis of the number of the death in the case of the number of the disease
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the mortality ratio to cases globally was 6.9<0x25> (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measurements include the case fatality figure (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died from certain diseases, and the number of infections (IFRs), which reflect the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population ranging from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the outbreak's epicentre in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village containing 4600 residents, 80 (1.7<0x25>) is dead.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spread to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and possibly not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3<0x25> of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0,004<0x25> of the population) were Confirmed died of COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality levels are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk difference between new men and women not appearing in their 90s.
In China, the death toll for men was 2.8 percent and for women was 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for differences based on this gender is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57<0x25> of people infected are men and 72<0x25> of people who die from COVID-19 are men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of women's gender-related health officers is higher, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for coronavirus, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the time the outbreak was first identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to certain geographical locations (e.g. China), animal species, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for namings aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as “coronavirus”.
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in accordance with 2015 guidelines calling for not using location names in the name of diseases and viruses.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital desperately needed a ventilator valve, and suppliers were unable to provide on the required time scale, a local company rehearsed and scored the required 100 valves overnight.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, false information, and disinformation arose regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread quickly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to several other animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no drugs or vaccines approved to treat this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the “SOLIIDARITY Trial” to examine the treatment effects of four existing antivirus compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines have not been available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccination candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccinations strategies that are being investigated.
First, researchers aim to make a complete viral vaccine.
The use of the virus, either inactive or dead virus, aims to quickly trigger the human body's immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits on the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on S-spike proteins that helped the virus infiltrate the receptors of the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is a nucleic acid vaccine ( DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making vaccinations).
The experimental vaccines made with these strategies should be tested to know its safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibodies-dependent increase has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials in April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated treatments that have been approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
New-purpose antiviral drugs make up most of China's research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivirs in some countries with reporting deadlines by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs was already present.Some of the existing antiviral drugs were being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which included remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, pylonavir/ritonavir, and beniferavir combined with
As of March 2020, there is temporary evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvements are observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being carried out in the US, China, and Italy. Chloroquin, formerly used to treat malaria, was researched in China in February 2020, with initial results.
However, there are calls for a peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, noted that double doses are very dangerous and deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the policy of doctors treating COVID-19 sufferers.The 7th edition of China guidelines also included interferon, ribavirin, or umufenovir for use against COVID-19.
Early data showed that high doses of ribavirin were needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in low concentrations.The study showed that early priming of bulging proteins by serine protease transmembran 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azitromycin have great limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur in the COVID-19 severe advanced stages.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquin may have antisytokin properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
The drug is undergoing phase 2 testing at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum feritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to fight cytokine storms, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by different causes, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no random and controlled evidence showing that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfers refined and bindable antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them are being researched as a method of passive non-vaccine immunization.
This strategy is tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a expected working mechanism for passive antibody therapy can mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that depend on antibodies and/or fagocytosis, are also possible.
Another form of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced, is in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which is a fluid part of the patient's blood that is already cured and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronavious disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
