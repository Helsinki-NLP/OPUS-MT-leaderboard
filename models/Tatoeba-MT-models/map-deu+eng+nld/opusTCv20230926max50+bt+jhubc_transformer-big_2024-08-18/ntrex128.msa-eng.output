The Welsh Council (AM) is concerned about "looking like a doll"
There are concerns among some AMs over their title proposals should be changed to MWP (Parliament Members of Wales).
It came about due to plans to change the name of the conference to the Parliament of Wales.
The entire political spectrum is concerned that it could be inviting a smuggling.
An AM of the Labour Party said his party took care of ‘he received with ‘Twp' and ‘Pwp'.
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means ‘fair' and ‘pwp' means ‘najis.'
Am from Plaid said his party as a whole was "unhappy" and had suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was ‘open thinking' about the name change, but stated it was a brief oral leap from the MWP to the Puppet.
In this context, the letter ‘w' in Wales is called the same as the Yorkshire English term for the letter ‘u.'
The Council's commission, which is enacting the law to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any shareholder called the Council Member must be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Council of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission informed the results of public negotiations on proposals that received broad support to call the council as the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of AM, the Commission favored members of the Parliament of Wales or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
AM seems to suggest alternative options, but it is problematic to reach a consensus and can flaunt the head of Honorary Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over a draft of the law on changes within a few weeks.
Laws on reform include other changes in the way the council works, including regulations on the loss of AM qualifications and the design of the committee system.
AM will get a final vote on what to call when they discuss the law.
Macedonia makes a vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the ‘North Republic of Macedonia.'
The popular vote was established in an effort to resolve disputes over decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which had its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that its northern neighbour's country's name represents a claim over its territory and has repeatedly denied its membership bids to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the opposition to the vote for the change in the name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was only the price to pay to join the EU and NATO unions.
St. Martin's Grace is silent as churches are struggling in Harlem.
“The parents I met said, historically, there are bars and churches in every corner of the street,” said Mr. Adams.
"Today, they're both gone."
He said the loss of a bar is understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way now," he said.
"Bar is no longer a living room in the neighborhood where people will always go."
For the church, he worried that money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect it, "and sooner they will return where they started."
Churches, he said, can be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who do not want to help maintain the sanctuary that is still in this neighborhood.
"The majority of people who are going to buy a condominium in this building are white people," he said, "and therefore will make these churches shut down at all because it is unlikely most people who enter this condominium will become members of the churches."
The two churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The Methodist Church moved in the 1930s.
The black church that had been worshipped nearby has taken possession of the building.
St. Martin had been taken over by blacks under Honored John Howard Johnson, who led a merchant boycott at 125th Street, a major shopping road in Harlem, which opposed the recruitment or promoting black people in the work.
The fire in 1939 made the building badly damaged, but as Pastor Priest, Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered a tower bell.
David Johnson, the son and successor of Priest Johnson in St. Martin, proudly referred to the tower bell as the ‘loceng of the poor people.’
Experts who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘Cultural heritage’ and ‘historic instruments that should not be replaced.'
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first bell in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played in St Martin over the past few months has been a hassle to architects and contractors, some brought by church leaders, others by Episcopal bishops.
Vestri's chamber - the governing body of the congregation, consisting of public leaders - wrote the bishop in July with concerns the bishop "will seek to pass the cost" for the vestry room, although the vestry room is not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some members of the church complain about the lack of transparency in the part of the bishop.
A 13-year-old boy injured while diving in search of coral reefs in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived in search of coral shrimp in California on the opening day of the season of coral shrimp, officials said.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the slave screaming for help and then rowed together with a group of people to help pull her out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun scream catching coral shrimp, but he "didn't notice that the boy cried, "I got to bite!
I've got to bite!"
"The whole bone of his collar has been torn apart and opened," Hammel said, "he noticed when he got the boy.
“I cried to everyone to get out of the water: “There is a shark in the water!” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of sharks responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media briefing that a shark had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but it has been confirmed a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury on the top of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles says there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams from a beauty-style space in an all-encompassing building controlled by an expert maid.
As part of an effort to enter the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow while fashion sales and home appliances return, a larger beauty space will be tested in 11 buildings across the country and brought to more buildings next year if it produces success.
Investing in beauty comes when supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves that were once charged for TV, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the size of its beauty offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
A wide range of existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the same branded parts as those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched a wide range of Boutique sole products in order for the majority of its products to be vegan-friendly - something growing in demand by buyers from young people.
In addition, perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test concessions on two Sainsbury supermarkets, the first to open in Croydon, south of London, last week while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
Shopping online and switching towards buying a little food every day at a local grocery store means the supermarket needs to work hard again to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury, said the branch would look like an all-encompassing building as the chain of supermarkets is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl's big business with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury laid the Argos branch in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several places since it bought both chains two years ago, it is said to have increased retail sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous market wanted to modify the beauty and pharmaceutical parts that ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boot in early 2000, but the partnership ended after arguing about how to divide revenue from pharmaceutical stores in the market.
A new strategy comes after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical shop businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds said he played a role in the plan, adding various luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four buildings.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the look and appearance in our beauty space to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest with friends who are specially trained to be prepared to offer advice.
Our range of brands are designed to meet every need, and an exciting environment and a comfortable location means that we are now an exciting beauty destination that challenges how to shop the old one."
Peter Jones 'cross' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 million offer
Peter Jones, Dragons star Den, 'cross' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contract with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for home goods and accessories from the True Brand.
The pair's business is similar to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning, 37, is using Instagram to announce that he will stop.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones, in a state of rage by withdrawing from a profitable lifestyle brand business at the end of the day - to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was ‘crossing' when the successful TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new bid - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she had no time to devote home goods and accessories from the Truly brand.
The business has been equated with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, uses Instagram to announce he is about to leave Truly, Jones flies out of Britain towards one of his conquest houses.
Sources said: "During this time, it has been Holly's priority.
It will be his long-term future that will be able to see him through the next few decades.
The decision to pull out everyone involved was really surprising.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters ready to sell."
Experts believe the delivery of This Morning, which is one of the most acceptable stars in the UK's banks, could damage the firms millions due to large investments in products consisting of culinary and wax up to clothing and home goods, and potentially to suspend its launch.
It could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, Mother of three children and husband Dan Baldwin has been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones had 40<0x25> stakeholders in Baldwin, a TV publishing firm.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's lawyer in the I'm A Celebrity' program.
A source close to Jones said last night "We won't comment on his business."
"We're in love and then we're in love"
He joked about the criticism that the news media would receive for making reviews that would partly consider ‘unreasonable to the president' and very positive about North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up too much?
Trump said by referring to the ‘newsreader’ voice.
"I never give up losing."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was crowned by Trump as a major step towards the cessation of North Korea's nuclear program.
But negotiations on the cessation of the nuclear program are negated.
More than three months after June's summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "similar response" from the United States about the North's initial ceasefire movement.
On the other hand, he said the U.S. is continuing restrictions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his meeting speech.
"Our relationship is good with North Korea," he said.
"We will fight with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free up the hostages, and bringing the body of the American military back home to the homeland.
And he defended his remarkable approach to talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this dense arena, we'll have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the public in front of him directly.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroying Islands, Killing Hundreds
After the incident of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population have been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, as a condition for enforcing international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they clearly don't ask for international help, so it's a bit challenging," Ms. Subuk said.
While Save the Children together in a team goes to Palu, it's not sure if foreign staff can work on the scene.
Sutopo, a spokeswoman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Based on the Earth's friction that Indonesia often faces, the country remains unprepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although warnings have been in force, it is like contributing to the loss of life.
At the best time, travel among the islands of Indonesia is indeed challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake was heading to Palu, but it took at least three days to reach a new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made severe infrastructure improvements a key factor in his election campaign, and he has made high allocation on highways and railways.
But the lack of funds has hit Jokowi's administration as he faces a re-election next year.
Jokowi faces pressure from the tensions of the mazhab in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have received a more conservative religious understanding.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought on the streets, using meadows, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge equalizes Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring one goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri when about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal with his team ahead of 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before kicking towards a distant goal net.
The attempt soared high above the goal goal as it drifted towards the top corner of the net right corner.
Finally the ball fell over Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always carry the ball as far as possible, so I try to lose as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and make a kick and don't think long and then hit on."
Chelsea came 1-0 in the half-time after getting a net in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before pitching in the middle of the pitch and running into the centre of Liverpool.
Kovacic giving and sending can be quickly in the middle.
He then released a beautiful kick, bringing Hazard into the goal.
The danger passed the defense and netted away with a left-footed kick past Liverpool player Alisson Becke.
Liverpool beat Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faced Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped under a tornado of buildings in a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Friday and triggered a 20-foot wave, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, is filled with debris from the collapsed building.
Police arrested 32-year-old man, suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation was conducted after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. with a stab at Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested for suspected murder.
Police have urged people in the area to see or hear anything to go forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in the early stages but I appeal to anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears something suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the front-board camera futej to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed the woman whose body was found was a local Birkenhead and she was found in her home.
In the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman had arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police say the investigation is underway, they are in a process to inform the heirs of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to get into his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was so excited when he knew what was going on.
Residents were told the investigation took hours until they were allowed to re-enter.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He continued to repeat "it's so horrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and one other van outside.
Several officers stood inside the cordon monitoring the apartment block of the apartment.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers by name at 0800 555 111 citing 247 logs from 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell Parliament becomes the latest warning hit by the "rewrite history"
His elimination would be poetic justice for destruction such as his Taliban with so many English artifacts and religion cultures carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as 'stupid' and 'try to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in today's debate about the removal of sculptures where Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace would be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the British civil war was neither directed nor run by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell would have been wrongly sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestors in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's exquisite representative against Cromwellada is evidence of the 19th century and part of the history of many people believe it is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered to be crowded, more crowded by the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender of external pressure, in the situation of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a full representative is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the next development of our country, and Cromwell is an individual known as a figure representing a divided part.
His achievement as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and commemorated."
Pigs Defeat Chinese Farmers to Die
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in markets in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, filled with blood near a market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou region of South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig breeder prepared to inject the vaccine into pigs on May 30, 2005, in <0x58>ining <0x51>inghai Province, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found a pig door next door open.
He said in a pig cage was a big pig of a man with his mouth bleeding.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had defended the farmer to death, according to the report.
"His family," Wu said, as quoted by the News Night Guiyang.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the store at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The killer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Night News that pigs had been locked to prevent him from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly making compensation negotiations for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs that attack humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon's farmers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not always aggressive but bloody tastes can act as a "sucker."
They're just kidding.
They're nippers, very curious to know... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to pay the right amount of respect," he said.
More typhoon Rosa brings extensive heavy rainfall to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is becoming weaker as it moves into cold water waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains in northern Mexico and southwestern the U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Category 1 hurricanes up to 5 a.m. East time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the trough that began to form in the Pacific Ocean and moved east towards the U.S. West Coast When Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it began to reject tropical north-western U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity interacted with a trough approaching which created heavy rains in the Southwest the next day.
Within the country, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, streams of debris and landslide likely in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially more than Arizona.
Slight floods may be in severe conditions due to tropical rainfall.
It is highly recommended to plunge into the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons for torrents and thunderstorms that will bring the country strong winds and dust blowing.
The closet will bring heavy rains on the southern California coast.
Rainfall amounts of more than half an inch may occur, which can lead to the flow of small fragments and slippery streets.
It became the first rain in the region in the dry season.
Several tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona through Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes further through Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
In October it can see some intense temperature changes across the U.S. when the Arctic gets colder, but the tropical area remains slightly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes with short distance temperatures.
There is a great example of the temperature difference through the U.S. center on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the warmth of winter will try to build and develop again.
Most U.S. centers and east are expected to see a warm start to October with the 80s extending from the South Plains to the Northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which estimates 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance for temperatures above average for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people witnessed a shocking testimonial on Thursday by potential Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and women who accused him of sexually assaulted in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political stalemates continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for the last minute touch Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh scrambled him and tried to open his shirt at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his statement, said 100 percent would not have happened.
It may be more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers are not immediately available for other networks that show PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a problem measuring people watching in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is the same size as the football game or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, who believes hosts have supported Kavanaugh's appointment, leads all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers while listening throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The benefits remain high after listening.
Flake is the main character in Friday's drama.
After a simple Republican office issued a statement he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested as a CNN and CBS camera on Friday screaming by protesters as he tried to climb the elevator to the hearings of the Justice Committee.
He stood with an eye-defenced for a few minutes when he slammed, aired live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
She was told, "You have power when many women don't have power."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, he would say a lot to the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered hours directly later, when the Justice Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would see allegations against naming next week, a minority democrat urged.
Flake was convinced part of the conversation with his friend, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation between Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice is indeed power, as it is clear Republicans will not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political play" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union "political" with Britain's future and affect the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his alleged attack as Checkers for Brexit, saying Britain and the EU reserves should collect tariffs each "completely unreasonable."
Shooter Wayde Sims: Police detain suspect Dyteon Simpson with LSU player's death
Police have detained the suspect in shooting dead Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed in prison on two-degree murder charges, police department Baton Rouge said.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost a mirror during the fight.
Police re-discovered the mirror from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA at them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
Following Simpson's allegations, police said he claimed Wayde had shot dead physically.
His Bon has been set at <0x24>350,000, a Peguar defender's report.
East Coroner Office Baton Rouge East issued an early report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head to the neck.
The department credits Louisiana State Police's confiscated officers, state police crime laboratories, South University Police and local people to assist in the investigations that led to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for "defence and justice efforts".
Sims is 20 years old.
6-foot-6 forward grew up at Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "very" and "surprised" with Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcanoes explode in Mexico City
Dust is spewing from the Popocatepetl volcano to the southern region of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes after increased activity in craters and it registered 183 gas and dust emissions for 24 hours.
The center monitors a variety of earthquakes and earthquakes.
Images on social media show a thin layer of car windshield in the ashes covered in residential areas of Mexico City such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geophysicists are aware of an increase in activity in volcanoes located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Katalan's misunderstandings ahead of independence's birthday
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined the demonstrations to mark the first anniversary in Catalonia's polarization election separation.
A group of masked pro-separators held by riot police threw them out with eggs and released paint powder, making dark clouds on the streets that tourists used to visit.
The fight also happened later with the police using their wands to fight.
A few hours later the pro-independence group shouted "Never forget, there is no forgiveness" confronting the unionist protesters who shouted, "Live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region of independence a year after the October 1 vote was deemed illegal by Madrid but were welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose to be free, although the percentage of voting exits were low with those opposed to segregation largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop the election taking place at voting stations across the region in a violent battle.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday to prevent demonstrations from supporting state police.
The protest took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer expected Catalonia's prospects to gain independence.
Last year we went through one of our best moments of life.
"I saw my parents crying so happy to be able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important management of approaching victory in the regional elections in December, the pro-independence Catalan party has struggled to maintain this year's momentum with the well-known leaders they are either in exile or in custody to wait for a trial for their role in regulating the referendum and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded a protest against police support on her phone, saying the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting stronger," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison before the trial since the end of last year, announced he will compete in the European Parliament election next year.
"To compete as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn regression in the values of democracy and the oppression we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Home Shot by Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car struck a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
Crossroads A may also have opened fire on the car at a time.
Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mega's first goal for Livingston earned victory
Livingston's rise surprised Rangers to hand Steven Gerrard over to a second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox's club.
Dolly Menga's attack proved different as Gary Holt's team moved to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team remain without a win at the Premiership this season and face the Hearts head, which they will trail with eight eyes, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended the unbeaten run in this part to six matches, with head coach Holt still feeling a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against opponents
Holt's team should have been far ahead before scoring, with their involvement causing the Rangers to face any problems.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his attempt past the goal, but Alan Lithgow was only able to give up his effort after clinching to Craig Halkett's horn.
Hostess are eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they can give a problem to the opponent with the set pieces.
And that’s the way an important goal exists.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston opened the curtain, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set Mega, who took the touch and goal network from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had mastered possession but had found a home defense that couldn't penetrate Liam Kelly's goalkeepers largely no problem.
The pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced to save Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored from another Livingston match.
Crosses continued to get into the Livingston box and continued to clean up, while two penalty charges - after Halkett's challenge of replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for the handball - went away.
'Fenomena' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
To men, they are very brilliant, continue to transcend the range of this rising trajectory.
The style of the game and their staff have barely changed since returning to the top, but a huge credit has been forced to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he came.
He has a lot of heroes.
Halkett's captain was very bold, realizing a great regular defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall across the toes.
The Rangers are less inspiring, though.
Nice as they were sometimes under Gerrard, they fell away from that standard.
The latter ball was somewhat lacking - only once they cut the host team- and it was a call for the rising Rangers, who found themselves at the middle desk.
Erdogan gets a wide welcome in Cologne
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They talked about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's participation in the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
It is the largest Turkish home outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for blocking 25,000 people from gathering in front of mosques, but many nearby supporters wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them are Kurds - also make their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
War protests described the part of a visitor who was praised as a hero by some Turks and was fired as an autocrat by others.
Deptford highway accident: Bicycle rider dies in collision with car
The cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The incident came months after another cyclist died in a run on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform him of his legacy.
Road closures and bus hikes in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disruption
Six prison officers were injured in a disturbance in a man's high-security prison, the Prison Office said.
Disorder occurs at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
The "Tornado" expert officer has been brought in to deal with the disorder, which involves eight occupants and has one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "Trained prison staff have been tasked with dealing with what is happening at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and obviously they are responsible for referring to the police and can spend longer behind the bar."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 detainees, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June he was reported to be the governor of the prison receiving hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officials had been called into prison to deal with serious disturbances in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Lightning Floods (Kamarau Area Benefits)
It is rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what might happen next week when Hurricane Rosa's wind power track crosses the Southwest Desert, the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood hours for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a route over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late last night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet only "ten tropical whites remain stormy or depressive status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a typhoon within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 2 to 4 inches of rain falls, with a remote amount of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the Southwest Desert include the center of the Rockies and Great Basin may get 1 to 2 inches, with a remote amount of up to 4 inches.
For them from the risk of flash flooding, Rose's rain may have been grace since the region was hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of the rainfall will benefit from the Southwest which is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Kemarau Monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona experienced the worst drought, the second-highest category, "reported by weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa route leads to the mainland on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, having a Sunday morning typhoon strength with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm faces cold waters in the Pacific and therefore generates downwards.
Therefore, it is expected to land collapse in Mexico on the strength of tropical storms in the evenings or evenings on Monday.
Rain across parts of Mexico can be heavy, causing the risk of major flooding.
"The rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to a northwestern Sonora, so maybe 10 inches," Weather.com reported.
Rosa will track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then it will detect through Arizona and south of Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or debris is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and streams of debris in the desert, and the ground collapses in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests attempted to kill
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found injured in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested yesterday in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
Officers appeal to those who may have a mobile phone recording of what's going on to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh is "depressed, meaningless, angry" by the Democratic Party
"The Kavanaugh Judge's vote was to reject cruel and outrageous tactics in the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "very severe, angry" Democrats during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh gave a briefing before Congress on Thursday, decisively and emotionally denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted during the decade during her teenage reeling.
Ford also gave a testimony to the hearing about his accusations.
The TPresident said on Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"One vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of the time, a lawmaker who has a brilliant record in public service," he told the crowd supporting West Virginia.
The president simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican elections in the general election.
"Five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn’t run, but I really ran,” he said.
“That’s why I’m in a place that’s fighting for great candidates.”
Trump argues that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and prevent."
The first major procedure vote in the Senate on the naming of Kavanaugh is expected to be carried out not late on Friday, GOP's senior assistant leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds were killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, a tsunami, with toll numbers increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many were struck by a giant wave that crashed on the coast, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18 ft) wave struck on land at dusk, swept many deaths and destroyed anything that was on their way.
Tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When a tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach and did not run and eventually they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, Indonesia's disaster arrest agency spokesman BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, poems, houses, it attacked them all on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before a blow on the edge.
Some people climb trees to escape the tsunami and be safe, he said.
About 16,700 people have been moved to 24 centers in Paluu.
Air images released by disaster agencies show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges swirling and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The end of the day continued to shake the city on the beach on Saturday.
Several aftershocks are felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's BPPT Technology Research and Applications Agency said in a statement that the energy released by a powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped at Hiroshima in World War II.
The city located at the end of a long, narrow bay may have increased the size of a tsunami wave, the agency said.
Nugroho described the destruction as ‘expanding' and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building and said another 540 people were injured and 29 others were still missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and destruction may be more devastating along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala.
"Communication is completely disconnected without any information' from Dongala," Nugroho said.
"At least 300,000 people live there," the Red Forces said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading to the affected area.
"This is a tragedy but it can get worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Palu even though officials said the tsunami took place during the warning period.
In a televised amateur video on social media, a man's voice sounded screaming at the crowd on the street about the presence of a tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a tsunami wave flooded the beach and drew together buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the validity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a massive power leak that decided to shut down communications around Palu and this made it difficult for authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid with cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities but the displaced population is still in need of other basic food and necessities, authorities said.
The airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the transfer center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll as a result of the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800 people.
It's so bad.
During the World Vision Staff from Dongala had survived to the city of Palu, they went through the scene of disaster. Workers took shelter under tarpal cloth established in the front yard of their office in Palu, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's so bad.
Although relief teams began to provide disaster relief in a bleak atmosphere, some said foreign aid workers who had deep experience were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies of needs and delivery of workers from abroad can only be carried out if disaster areas are declared the country's disaster zone.
That still hasn't happened.
"It's still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Forces.
"When the government says "OK, it's a national disaster," we can only accept help from abroad but now there's no status anymore."
As the second night approached in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the victims who were still missing hope that their loved ones would become a miracle that emerged and chanted them from feeling sad.
On Saturday, a boy was found in a squirrel.
On Sunday, the rescue team rescued the victim of a woman trapped under a rockfall for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian nation's launch team, has trained two para launchers who have been missing as a result of the earthquake for the Asian Games, which has ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi said.
"As a senior in the field of paragliders, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told the story of how he had earnestly sent WhatsApp messages to the launchers at Palu who joined the beach festival after hours of news about the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel spread among the community of the launchers.
The message sent only has one yellowish-brown rait sign compared to two blue-colored raisins.
"I don't think the message is coming," he said.
Thieves robbed <0x24>26,750 during ATM recharging in Newport on the Levee
The thief robbed <0x24>26,750 of Brink's workers who filled money at the Newport on the Levee ATM on Friday, according to news released by the Newport Police Department.
The Brink employee vacated the ATM in the entertainment complex and was willing to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink's worker was busy doing his job, a man ‘runs towards his back' and steals a bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene based on the report, but police did not state how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the thief should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rap singer changed his name to Ye
Rap singer Kanye West changed her name - to Ye.
Announcing his name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West."
Kanye West, 41, was named Ye for a moment and she used the nickname as the title of her eighth album published in June.
The change occurred when he appeared in Saturday Night Live's show where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
“He replaced singer Ariana Grande who cancelled her appearance on the show over ‘emotional problems,’” the show’s creator said.
Earlier, Kanye West said that the name had a religious meaning and was also an abbreviation for his current professional name.
“I believe ‘ye' is a common word often found in the Gospel book and it means ‘you,’” Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of her album with a Big Boy radio host.
"So I'm you too, I'm also us, we're us.
He switched from Kanye which meant only one, to Ye - a reflection of our good, evil and error and all.
The album is more of a reflection of our own true image."
He was one of the most famous rap singers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year she announced that she prefers her name Love and Brother Love.
Former partner Kanye West, JAY-Z can also accept it without or with cross-border and large letters.
Mexico's President, AMLO vows not to use military action against civilians
Mexico's elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military action against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of a bloody tragedy against students.
AMLO pledged at Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday to "never use the military to curb Mexicans."
The military fired at the plaza on October 2, 1968, causing 300 civilians to die during the left-wing student movement began to camp across Latin America.
AMLO vows to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said the unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to engage in criminal gangs.
The United States should double artificial intelligence funds
"The United States should double the amount of funding in the field of artificial intelligence as China is becoming increasingly active in the field," said Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view was stated after the U.S. government made an announcement on artificial intelligence even though the United States itself as a whole lacked an official strategy of artificial intelligence.
China launched its plan last year with the aim of becoming the number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Considering the provision of artificial intelligence studies is a good start as all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to have the next success in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"By doubling funds can increase the chances of the next big achievement of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book 'AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order' was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Sinovacation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most famous companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that had defeated American Othello players who were in the best position while still studying at Carnegie Mellon University.
Lee recognizes previous US government technology competitions such as the Robot Challenge from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and wants to know when the next competition will be held so that he can identify new talents.
"Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to win government assistance," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders but corporate companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed great talents from the university to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence," he said.
China's State Council issued a Future Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
"The Chinese National National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people in academic institutions. It equals the way the State Science Foundation and other government organizations divide funds to U.S. researchers but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence aimed at gathering partners from industry and academies. The White House announced the ranks of the Selected Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of <0x24>2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. bill trying to establish the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented in recent months.
The people of Macedonia voted to change the country's name.
The people of Macedonia held a vote on Sunday to determine the change of name to the ‘North Macedonian Republic'. An action that would resolve a dispute with Greece that had been disputed for a decade in which Greece had prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia, asserts that the name ‘Macedonia' represents a claim over its territory and has vetoed to reject Macedonian participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name change in June but the nationalist opposition said the conversion degraded the ethnic Macedonian identity whose majority of the population was Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the vote and the starter raised doubts as to whether the vote would reach a minimum of 50 per cent of the vote required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper was written: "Do you agree to join NATO and the EU with the approval of Greece?"
Proponents of the name change include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said "The acceptance of a new name is a price that is worth paying to join the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because that means our lives are safer," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 at Skopje.
Despite being unauthorized on the legal side, parliamentarians said they would comply with the vote's decision to make it the final.
The change in the name requires two-thirds of the majority in the parliament.
The country's electoral commission said there were no reports on things that were not in the rules that took place until 1 p.m.
However, the voting attendance was 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election after 66 percent of registered voters cast ballot papers.
"I came to vote because of my children. Our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko threw a ballot paper in Macedonia for the country's change of name that would pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and laying chairs in front of the tent set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join it with a sense of pride and not this way," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor people, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as the people of Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said participation in NATO would provide sufficient investment to Macedonia where its unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe a large majority will receive because more than 80 percent of our population voted for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the ‘yes’ decision is ‘the confirmation of our future.’
A vote was published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Police Studies that said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - below the required amount.
Another vote, run by Macedonian TV Telma, found 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For one vote, the number of votes coming must be 50<0x25> plus one vote.
Failure to vote will be considered the first serious blow to pro-Western government police since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton's entire defensive line to score goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent as Brighton's defences at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look very happy on his network in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He raced between the three Brighton defences, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green-clothed players.
He refused a defense before chasing a few more people at the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he refused to send to the left, looking for Sterling.
The forward English player used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right butt to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with one kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with his leg problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at the time."
But Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League match.
The goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero received an inside ball in the Brighton area at the match.
He made a beautiful pass ball through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling towards a distant position.

Scherzer wants to play only against the Rockies.
With the Nationals being eliminated from the game's outdated clashes, there is no reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to face the stronghold on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are outplaying implications for the Rockies, who hold one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies embrace at least a special odds spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock up their first share champions.
"Although we're just playing, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams will play probably at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to fight in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce novices for Sunday, but it is reportedly likely to allow Scherzer to make a break in the situation.
Scherzer, who will make the start of 34, held a heating session on Thursday and will make a break on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right-handed propeller from Washington was 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 shots right in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Meetings in West Virginia
The president does not consistently refer to the situation around the High Court elects Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the number of Republicans coming in midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to face the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not competing but I’m very competitive and that’s why I’m in all places fighting for a great candidate,” he said.
Trump said, "You see this terrible Democratic radical group, you see it's happening right now.
And they're trying to reclaim power by using any method, you see atrocities, evils.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to break to gain power and loss. What they want is power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to ‘reject and stop.'
"And you've seen that for the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats 'embarrassed, evil and untrue.'
He refers to the Justice Committee's position of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who has received a strong boo from the audience.
"Remember the answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, I wait one - it's the very worst body language- the worst body language I've ever seen"
Worker is no longer a large church.
It's not tolerated for anyone who expresses their views.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it's not boring.
I'm the newest in the Labour AP line told that we're not welcome - all for voiceing our views.
My MP Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because he supported anti-Semitism.
In my case, the protest movement has criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interest of responsibilities about economic policy, about national security, about Europe, whose ironic issue is almost the same as what Jeremy did not agree with the previous leader.
The meeting notice for the Nottingham East Labour party said on Friday that "we want a meeting that covers all and is productive."
For almost eight years as a local Labour AP, the GC meeting on Friday night really covered all of that.
Unfortunately today, it is not a tone for many meetings and political promises ‘better, softer' has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It is increasingly evident that the differences in views are unacceptable in the Labour party and each opinion will be judged whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as a colleague who had previously been, I thought sharing a nearly the same political outlook began expecting me to make a U round and take a position that I would not agree - whether on the national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak out - and it doesn't matter what I'm saying - then it will be followed by a censure because of abuse on social media, told not to vote, denounced political centers, told me to get out of the Labour party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than my co-workers for commenting on me more on politics.
I'm amazed by the professional attitude and persistence of fellow workers who are showered with sexist and racist vows every day but never give up.
One aspect of political disappointment in this era is how the level of abuse has become accustomed to.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour party cultivate cultural tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a vast church and with every ‘no-believe' or change in election rules, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
I received a lot of advice over the past two years urging me to remain silent, not very prominent and then I will ‘be good.'
But that’s not my goal of entering politics.
Since I joined Labor 32 years ago as a school student, raised by the neglect of Thatcher's government that allowed my entire grade class to be destroyed, I've tried to lead better public services for those in great need - whether as a local council member or government minister.
I've never kept my politics secret, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East may be mistaken about my position and part of the opposition with the current leadership.
To those who support the proposal on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will destabilize our household, business and public services, I don't understand the feeling of wasting time and energy over my loyalty to Labour party leaders.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voter, whether it's a Labour member or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise unelected or political suitability doesn't prevent me from acting in what I believe is for the benefit of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unmatched Ayr climbs to the summit
Two slow attempts may have made the final round, but Ayr is no doubt worthy of success in this exciting and entertaining Premiership Tennent match.
They are now in the top spot on the table, the only one has never lost out of 10 people.
Finally, their superior defense, as much as they took the opportunity, which made the host team and coach Peter Murchie happy.
"We've been tested for our game so far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thanks to Ayr, they take a better chance than we are."
Grant Anderson made a try in the 14th minute, conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr ahead, but, yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, was issued for a match by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make a network and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted try.
Climo ahead of Ayr with a penalty, before, in halftime, he got an eye and then a solo conversion attempt to make 17-5 to Ayr on a break.
But Melrose started second well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, a conversion by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long delay due to Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, which was brought out, and from the start, Ayr went forward again through Stafford McDowall's attempt, a conversion by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson's waitress was then given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose retaliated additional players with an unconversion attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a fierce pressure period.
The home team returned, however, and when Hutchinson's Struan was given a yellow card due to a ballless climo tackle, from the outside line of the penalty, MacPherson cranked behind a forward hit Ayr.
The conversion climo, as he did almost as it started, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent away flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth try of the home team.

The pair have announced that the ninth series is coming to be the last in the draft, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to an official record report, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun source gave a shadow that Kiernan wanted to engage in ‘the growing restaurant business.'
'The sea belongs to us': Bolivia surrounded by mainland hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Navy chief naval officer in La Paz.
The public building flies the blue flag of the sea.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to Amazon was categorized by the motto: 'The ocean is ours.
Getting back is a responsibility."
Throughout Bolivia surrounded by land, the memory of losing the coast to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still apparent - like a longing to travel the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope may be the highest in the century, as Bolivia is still waiting for a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of talks.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course hope for a positive decision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia’s diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch ICJ decisions on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will side with the Bolivian demands - after centuries of talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic original president - who faces a controversial match for the next year's re-election - also has many interests in Monday's decision.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision on the side of Bolivia - and if it happens very little will change.
The Dutch-based UN agency is not in power to award the region to Chile, and has set that it will not determine the decision for possible discussions.
On ICJ's decision to come out after only six months of final arguments were heard showing the case "not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Chile's international legal expert.
And not to slow down the Bolivia base again, for these four years there may be obstacles.
"The issue of entry into the sea has been seized by the Bolivian administration now," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' rhetorical hostility has reduced Chile's little compassion, he suggests.
Bolivia and Chile at a time will continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to hold a discussion later.
The two countries have not been ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was usually quick.
On Monday it will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open a new era relationship with Chile" and have the opportunity to "finish a 139-year dispute for the common good," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America - used maritime issues as political aid.
"Bolivia has never given up on its right to get a direct route to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons crackdown will not happen unless it believes in the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not do their nuclear weapons strikes first if he did not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to carry out the promises made during a summit in Singapore among rival leaders.
His remarks came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to restart the ceaseless nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said he was “just a constant restriction” and U.S. opposition to the declaration of ending the Korean War would cause North Korea to give up.
Washington was careful to agree to a declaration without Pyongyang earlier making important acts of armistice.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is seriously about launching a weapon seen as the only way to guarantee the security of his country.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for the preparation of Kim-Trump's second summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest design of a large head decoration on its way to the main road near you.
If you want to add your hat collection or completely block sunlight, then you don't have to look far.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a wide range of bizarre head decorations for their SS19 collection on stage of the show that graced the style set on Paris Fashion Week.
The impractical hat has swept Instagram this summer and this designer has sent their charming designs to the stage of the show.
Valentino’s outstanding design is a great water yellow-colored hat decorated with thick artificial furs that wide covered the model’s head.
Other large-sized accessories include gem-sized pottery, smart caps and even nasal - but they are not designed to keep your head hot.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks - and the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful white masks have sewn their lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter than graceful fashion.
One design resembles scuba diving equipment equipped with snorkel and gogal, while the other looks like liquid ice cream.
And if you keep up with the big fashion reality - you're lucky.
Style observers predict that a very large bonnet may be heading to the main road near you.
The large-sized hat is warm from 'La Bomba', a straw hat with a full two-foot width has been seen wearing everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The king's label behind the highly impractical hat has been posted on social media sending another large design to the stage of the show - a straw beach bag is almost as big as the model wearing the bathtub.
The ragfia bag is burning orange, decorated with rafia sidelined and coupled with white holders, which stands out in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity style expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to be able to see big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for the coming summer - because designers have made a very large impact and it is difficult to let demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens
Scotland's private schools maintain performance records for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another brilliant set of exam decisions, reinforced by individuals and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Board (SCIS), seeks to serve at the best level to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students to pursue higher lessons, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As the education sector they can and carry out an earlier school curriculum, we see the modern language continues to be well-known and the subject of the choice of yams desired within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language that is understood, it will get into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother's language, it will come into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can't rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we can see that language is the top subject in the league table with the highest graduation rate in private schools.
68<0x25> of students who learn foreign languages get higher A grades.
This data, collected from 74 SCIS schoolchildren, showed 72 percent of students got a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them studied German, 69 percent of them studying French and 63 percent of Spanish learning also got A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will no longer need them in the future.
Language now, as the subject of choice, is being held the same as the subject of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that employers were struggling to meet the vacancy, 17 percent were linked to a lack of language skills.
Therefore again and again, language skills become a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective employment opportunities requiring language, this skill is very important in this global world.
Regardless of a person's chosen career, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will put someone who masters many languages automatically in front of the competition.
According to YouGov's vote of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak in a foreign language well enough for conversations, with French as a conversational language only used by two-digit percentages, 15 percent.
This is why investing in today's language teaching is important for today's children.
Having a wide range of languages, especially the country is developing its economy, will equip children with better opportunities in finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language they learn.
The school will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the language seen as important for the UK when looking forward in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are often many languages that can be chosen from within the private school-like, with teachers who specialize in that section.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
Undoubtedly at this time, in a global business environment, whose language continues to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered ‘international communication skills.'
Private schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron will make the Lakers' first appearance on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening match before the season on Sunday against Nuggets Denver in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is not yet determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers goalkeeper Mike Trudell acknowledged that James might be playing in a limited minute.
Following early training this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule before the Lakers season.
"I don't need a game before the season to be ready for my career," he said.
Trump Meeting Time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a fast-paced rally campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was Trump's first of five scheduled meetings next week, including stopping at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation vote held for him to vote to meet the vacancy in the Federal Court, Trump aims to achieve support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in Nov.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's meeting at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live streams on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's trial for potential Federal Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been strained by allegations of sexual misconduct with a Senate vote confirmation expected to be held for a week during the FBI's investigation.
But the main goal of this rushing rally is to help Republicans gain momentum in the face of the November election.
President Trump's campaign said five meetings next week were to "enforce volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and develop the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is very critical of his agenda so that the president will go to as many states as we can to the busy campaign season," Trump's unnamed campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a country he won more than 40 percent of his eyes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Party candidate Patrick Morrsey, who is following him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrsey until the president needs to come to support him," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. forces show the courage to fight in ensuring hope is still on their way to a single match on Sunday
After three side-by-side matches, a round-up match on Saturday evening is probably what Ryder Cup needs this time.
The momentum swings is a sport concept that is a creation but it is truly believed by the player, and more so in a match like this.
So, where's the momentum now?
"They have an advantage of six points and now it's four points, so we bring a little momentum, I think," Jordan Spieth said as he walked at the end of the day.
Europe certainly has an advantage, four eyes ahead with twelve more eyes to capture.
American players, as Spieth said, felt they had little advantage and a sense of urgency, not only from Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each had three out of four eyes.
Spieth exhibits venomous games from start to green areas and becomes an example to other players.
The vibrant gestures were getting stronger as he continued to march, performing a leret shot that was important to match four eyes when he and Thomas missed after two eyes.
His streak that gave them a victory on the 15th hole was welcomed with the same cheer, which tells you that he believes the American team is still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all for all these players right now.
18 holes to show power.
Only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the story in the indisputable Ryder Cup.
The pair of players are different from Europe but love four points out of four and don't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not do bogies on Saturday evenings, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
The period and the way their energy is given and demonstrated by supporters is proof they are players to be defeated on Sunday, and no player is more popular to block European chances of winning during the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both of them are in a different hole.
However, the conversation about the European team's victory was too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it easier for Sergio Garcia, the four-player hero this morning, when he compared to Alex Noren.
One bogie and two doubles in the first nine holes exquisite the Spaniard and the Swedish player.
However, on Sundays, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch closely due to the interaction between the pair, the advice given and not given and the strategies that can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe played better as a team so far and ahead of the last day, but this four session also showed the U.S. Army gained the courage that was previously doubted by many parties, including local fans.
European teams ahead 10-6 to the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe brought a comfortable advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after rising from a four-ball match and four players with 10-6 points over the United States.
Both great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari ahead with two wins over Tiger Woods struggling to bring their win at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn attempted to maintain a trophy seized at Hazeltine two years ago, taking over the wrong American team in a four-ball morning session, with a 3-1 series eye.
The U.S. team gave more competition in a four-player game, winning two matches, but could not close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points out of 12 points in Sunday's singles match to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first new European player to win four consecutive points during his and Molinari, who were named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend was the second pair to win four points out of their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then together defeated Woods and American new player, Bryson Dechambeau in a 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who went through two difficult matches on Saturday, showed excellence but has now lost 19 of 29 four balls and four players and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who did not play a break during a four-ball morning session, returned to a match with Henrik Stenson in a four-player match to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2<0x26>1 - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe has no luck on a quiet and relaxing day in southwestern Paris.
Three-time major championship winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the measuring wood for America with two eyes on Saturday.
They won 2<0x26>1 defeating Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in a four-ball match and then again defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4<0x26>3 match in a four-player game that was killed on two opening holes.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team that missed four points to a single match, although as defending champions Furyk only needed a series to keep the trophy.
After taking second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday looked like outside their reach.
North Korea says it is "not possible" that they will disarm voluntarily without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued restrictions have led to their deep distrust of the United States and it is unlikely that the country will release nuclear weapons voluntarily in the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "an important step" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, closing the nuclear test site and promising not to extend the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in the security of our country and in such circumstances, it is unlikely that we will be able to disarm the weapon in the first place."
Although Ri reprimanded complaints against North Korea about Washington's opposition to the "stage" approach of nuclear termination in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took a gradual step, the reality seems important as it did not reject the voluntary refusal as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to strive to "nuclear conservation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump gave assurance to North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang had to unleash its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused to follow the proposal to loosen international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. asserts "pre-examination" and increases pressure levels in restrictions to achieve their goals forcibly, and even opposes "the final declaration of war," Ri said.
"The perception that the restriction can weaken us is the empty dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the constant restrictions are worsening our disbelief."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by the U.S. leader during the United Nations conference earlier this week.
The minister said only three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the party on this termination issue is South Korea and not the US, the nuclear termination from the Korean peninsula will not find a standstill."
However, Ri's speech tone differs dramatically compared to last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable after Trump's "Mr. Evil President" named Kim as a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations conference, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still needs to be done and restrictions need to remain in place until North Korea terminates its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must be continued vigorously and without fail until we feel nuclear termination completely, absolutely and certified."
The Security Council has unanimously increased restrictions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dismantle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been achieved, only for North Korea in hours after which he had condemned him for making "ganster-like demands."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to expose missile sites and nuclear complexes if the United States took "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "same steps" Kim was looking for was a security guarantee that Trump had promised in Singapore and was heading towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken the course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all its students more sleep in an effort to combat the increasingly becoming learning culture through a caffeine-based 'night'.
A teaching staff finds students at number one universities in the world often unable to understand the basics to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, provided a course he believed to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He received inspiration to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation during learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said: ‘Why am I just being told about this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students about the needs of good sleep habits to help academic and sports performance, as well as improve their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students lack of sleep throughout the week.
The one-hour course involved several interactive tasks.
In one part, there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep routines.
In other parts, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Campus maps with interactive icons, then encourage participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the student right away.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride in ‘keeping all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means lack of sleep is an increasingly deteriorating problem.
Ensure you have enough quality of sleep, it should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says - even to avoid weight gain, due to lack of sleep putting the brain into famine mode, making it always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studied physical chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czechisler design the course, after taking his class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to develop the course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same learning program before joining competitive institutions.
Czeisler's professor suggests that students should consider the use of alarm clocks before as well as after sleep, and realize the hazard effects of 'blue light' released by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can damage your circadian rhythms from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Mengga kills Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another defeat in the opponent's place when Dolly Menga's network tied down Steven Gerrard's weak team with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team is still looking for the first win in the opponent's place since a February 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as a manager to cause his team to miss eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership league predecessor Hearts.
It exploded in the seventh minute before the first half of the season and the Rangers seemed to have no idea of equalising the position.
With the Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third and was just behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers may face problems again after the line-keeper, Calum Spence was forced to be treated for a head injury after being propelled an object from his team's area.
Gerrard made eight exchanges on his team that went into the half-finals of the Betfred Cup after defeating Ayr.
Holt kept the same team of Livi 11 who stole one eye from Hearts last week and he was certainly happy with the way his team was worried about their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have mastered the game but Livingston did more attempts on the goal.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after Mega's first touch gave Scott Pittman space through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder was missing.
The free kick from behind Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only send the ball behind the goal.
The Rangers managed to recapture the mastery but it remained only hopeful in the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he was supposed to be given a penalty kick in the forty-fifth minute when he and Steven Lawless interconnected but forward Steven Thomson left the Colombian player's appeal.
The Rangers managed to give only two tries right in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily knocked out Lassana Coulibaly's horns and weak kicks Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be contrary to the game's streak, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers once again failed to face Jacobs' planned move.
Scott Arfield was only stiff when Declan Gallagher dragged the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent to Mega for an easy finish.
Gerrard made an exchange during the break by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and it almost gave an immediate impression when the winger gave the ball to Morelos but Kelly was amazingly out of his area to block.
But Livingston continued to make it difficult for the opposing team to play the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sending away for a long haul.
Holt's team were supposed to widen the gap in the final rounds but McGregor defended well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's horn was knocked out of the corner of goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton appealed for another penalty shootout as he clashed with Jacobs but again Thomson ignored him.
Almanak: Creator of the Geiger
And now, the page of our Almanak “Friday”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and the day on which the physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device known as KeiraGeiger.
As the main foundation of science since then, Counter Geiger became the backbone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring unidentified scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "It is the Geiger Pengira, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the effect of atoms given by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: Yeah, it sounds right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creation that carries its name is eternal.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to 'see' evil cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to 'see' evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify evil cells as part of treatment
The method involved is extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory
It can 'see' the protein that is common to many cancer cells and then re-injected.
The vaccination test showed results that stimulated patients with various types of cancer.
A woman is treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize evil cells, recovering from her ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the proteins that are common to many types of cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our test results show that we have a very good vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancers," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal, explains Prof Berzofsky.
The same approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them a way to target cancer cells has been successful in treating the type of leukemia.
Kanye West Joins Pro-Trump Cercaan, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After his SNL Appearance.
He was not well received.
Kanye West was ridiculed at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a great performance in which she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said she would compete in 2020.
After performing his third song that night called Ghost Town where he wore a ‘Make America Great’ hat, he continued to oppose Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"A lot of times I asked white people and they said, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
“If I’m worried about racism, I’ve moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star came up with Brett Kavanaugh's recognition before the Senate Justice Committee on allegations of sexual assaults made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Kanye West's recordings were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to mock West with that post.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has had trouble behind the stage about his hat.
"They hit me behind the stage.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that hat.”
They bullied me!
Then they said, "I'm in an insignificant place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "You want to see that insignificant position?" by saying that he'll "wear my superman's coat, because this means you can't lead me. You want the world to move forward?
Try the love."
Comments he invited ridicule at least twice from the audience and SNL actors looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one there telling the publication: "The whole studio is quiet."
West has been brought in instead of singer Ariana Grande, where her ex-boyfriend, singer Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised many people with the song I love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West received support from the chairman of TPUSA's conservative group Candace Turner who sent the ciapan: "To one of the bravest human beings: THE RIGHTEOUSE FOR YOU OUR RIGHTS."
But a ciapan from an interview show host, Karen Hunter said West was just "being himself and that's great."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I believe accepts and shares an ideology that endangers my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now known as "the man who used to be known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, a rapper, Snoop Dogg once changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course his song refers to the legend's music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later also as an artist formerly known as Prince.
He was charged with attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrate Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star, Kit Harington breeds toxic masculinity
The Harington Kit is best known for the character of the sword hero as Jon Snow in the medieval fantasy series HBO, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has sparked a stereotype of the maco hero, calling his character played on the screen meaning youngsters often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "there was something wrong" and questioned how to deal with toxic masculinity problems in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Games of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits she feels "very strong" about dealing with the problem.
"I think it's quite strong personally, at the moment - where's our fault with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problems we're seeing now?"
Kit believes television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: "What is nature and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel they need to be men like this?
I think it's one of the most important questions right now - how do we change it?
"There's something wrong with the young man right now."
In the interview, he also admitted he would not play any pre-order or Game of Thrones when the series ended in the summer, saying he was "finished with battlefields and horses."
In November, Kit will star in the remake of True West by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a robber.
The actress recently revealed she thought meeting with her wife, Rose, was the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this plan, so that's why she gave me my family the future and my life started from here," he said.
Rose brings the character Ygritte, the love of Jon Snow played by Kit, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reported a 14<0x25> increase in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are contracted through sex, signaling changes than before.
Typically, HIV spread rapidly through several parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people with HIV in this way has been reduced to nearly zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of HIV and AIDS people in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be increasingly becoming.
Due to the country's conservative value, studies estimate that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of the disease is due to insufficient sexual protection in the relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies his staff leaking GOP senator data, sparking 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations of a staff member who has posted personal information on three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrats confirmed the claim had been spread by members of the " ultra-right wing" and the website.
“Sculpting, fraud and more of a bad scam,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
This information was reported to include home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, broadcast by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against potential Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported IP addresses identifying the source of the shipments associated with the Waters office and spreading the information of Waters staff members, Hill said.
"This unfounded accusation is false and one lies," Waters said again.
"My staff - where its identity, personal information, and security have been compromised on the grounds of these false allegations - have absolutely nothing to do with the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and form of fraud."
Waters' statement quickly invited online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This fiend is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that he doesn't have the right to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of doing something they don't do, they can't get angry.
They can't resist.
They can't question the motives.
They have to be calm."
Fleischer said while comparing Waters' reactions and Democratic criticisms to Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics who looked too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who contested to beat Waters in a midterm election, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news if it's true," he tweeted.
In fact, Waters said his office had notified "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities on these false charges.
"We will make sure the perpetrators will be exposed," he said, "and they will be responsible for all their actions that can be devastating and dangerous to any and all my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Review Again - Rowan Atkinson's poor intelligence scam
It's common now to find Brexit signs in any new film with British slang and it seems to be applicable to the revival of Johnny English's action-comedy fraud franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a joke about how bad it is to be a new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny English who likes to silence and bored the opportunity to ruin the situation for the second time - the sign's name is more than all that he is a widespread comic creation designed for the area of non-English-language movie audiences.
He is of course a strangely glamorous secret agent to relax the character of Clouseau, little Mr Bean and a musician who contributed one note to the theme song Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also inspired by the mysterious international spy traveler and agent Rowan Atkinson who has appeared in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television ad, leaving chaos after that.
There's one or two great times in JE's latest film.
I love Johnny English approaching the helicopter while wearing medieval war shirts and fan blades attached to her helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is being aired, but the joke feels very weak and strange, especially "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offering comedy as their material.
Funny felt as if it was highlighted for children rather than adults, and for me the mistake of Johnny English's accidental innovate and focused on Atkinson's films in Bean's persona.
The main premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated into Britain's secret web network, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field and disappointing agents in charge - a very small character for Kevin Eldon.
It was the last chance for the proud prime minister and who was struggling with political collapse and unpopularity: Emma Thompson gave her best with Teresa May's side character but nothing was good in the script for her character.
His advisory informs him every active spy has been compromised, and he needs to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is busy and now works as a school teacher in some luxurious places, but gives an inappropriate lesson to become a secret agent: some good jokes here, as English offers inspiration science in academia such as the School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged to a submarine commander, a rather detrimental character carried by Vicki Pepperdine.
So, Batman and Robin who excelled in the Secret Service of Your Majesty's Underworld, return to action against Ophelia Bulletova's beautiful teaser girl character by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being affected by a charismatic technology millionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: Jason Volta is evil and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures with a small task: disguised as a waiter, lit a fire and burned a French restaurant; smuggled themselves into Volta's luxury cruise ship; and English sparked chaos as he tried to use the headphones of the Maya Reality to familiarize himself in Volta's house.
All the funny scenes were well-published for the last half, but because it seemed friendly and low-cost there was a bit of a sense like a child's television show about it.
It's a very simple film.
And just like other Johnny English films, I'm curious: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really fits his talent?
The Nafi Labor Party plans for the British people to work four days a week but is paid for five days
Labour Party chairman Jeremy Corbyn considers a radical plan that will see Britons work four days a week - but is paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to channel the savings made through the AI's artificial intelligence revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It will watch staff enjoy the weekend for three days - but still bring home the same salary.
Sources said the idea was "in accordance with the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country in favor of the workers.
Switching to work for four days a week is supported by the Congress of the Workers' Union as a way for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A right-wing source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: 'The basic study is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
"It's not going to happen overnight but working for four days a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to balance the economy and favors workers as well as the overall industry strategy of the party."
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week in the 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day working week is not the basis of the party and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour trial last week by advancing his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he intends to seize power from the "faceless" and "cattutor" at the utility firm.
The design of the shadow cancellor also means that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to regain their entire share because the Labour government can make a ‘cut’ based on the reason they are considered to be making a mistake.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the company's board of directors and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 percent of private sector firm equity to employees, who will receive an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the last vote on his candidacy to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised questions as to whether the bureau's findings could affect Republican senators to provide their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more open than his friend from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you to attend the trial, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, which the accusation appeared, and said, 'Are you doing it?'
He's strong, clear, and clear."
However, Graham's vote has already been decided.
"I have already made Brett Kavanaugh's tentative decision and he will take heavy charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know about this: Brett firmly denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he named can't confirm it.
It's 36 years.
You don't see any changes."
Is the World People's Party and Did It Do Something To Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World People's Party, an annual music show with an impressive array of great stars and an equally great mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in the seventh year, the World People's Party will see tens of thousands of people gathered at Central Park's Great Site to not only watch performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Party, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people active against it.
To receive free tickets for this event (unless you are willing to pay VIP tickets), visitors of this concert need to complete some tasks, or "acts" such as being a volunteer, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, how far does the world's population have to achieve its goals in the next 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert an honest way to persuade the public to demand an action, or just another case of "clicktivism" - to make someone feel they have done something by simply signing a petition online or by sending one cipan?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have recorded 19 million "acts" from its supporters, which urges movement with different goals.
They said these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth over <0x24>37 billion that will bring change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group identified 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, and at least <0x24>10 billion of that amount had already been recovered or collected.
The group also estimates that these identified funds have impacted nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some important committees include the Nutrition Power, a partnership between UK-based investors and stakeholders committed to "helping children achieve their full potential", promising to donate <0x24>35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate the unbalanced diet in the negativity after receiving more than 4,700 ciapans from Gobal Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, federal governments and Global Citizens like yourself, we can turn this unbalanced social inequalities of nutrition into a history story," Tracey Ullman said during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has proposed to finance a project, the Nutrition Power, which will now reach 5 million women and children who need it.
Answer one of the most common questions on his website asking "What makes you think we can end the hardest poverty?"
Global Citizens have responded: "This is a difficult path and will take time - sometimes we will be disappointed and disappointed.
But, just as the movement demands civil rights and anti-apartheid before, we will succeed, because when we work together we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e is one of several artists who also perform at this year's show in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "blocking" to prevent Russia from exporting oil - Secretary of State
Washington could "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil on the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said in a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - as it is known, involved themselves in an invitation to the Syrian government - is said to be seeking a new oil market.
"I believe their presence in Central Tmur is to control the oil supply as they have done in eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
According to the report, there is a way to address this issue.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure the sea route is open, and if necessary, to prevent their oil from being marketed," he said.
Zinke said that when making a speech at a Consumer Energy Alliance urging event, a non-profit group that emits itself as an "an oil consumer voice" in the U.S..
He also compared Washington's actions to Russia and Iran, and stressed the same.
"The economic options on Iran and Russia are roughly the same, affecting and replacing oil," he said, while referring to Russia as having no other choice and with its economy so dependent on oil.
The statement was issued during the Trump administration on a mission to increase the export of liquid natural gas to Europe which is much cheaper to consumers in Europe, replacing Russia.
Trump's officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said would make Berlin be sent by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream pipeline project will delay the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters and it is the sole economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington is so strongly opposed to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we believe that energy supplies should not be used as weapons to suppress and users should be free to vote," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said in a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. action has invited Germany's dissatisfaction, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organization, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy base as well as on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when there's a third country that's mixed in our country's energy supply issues," said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladmir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Make Cooking Think" to Competition as President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says.
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Senator, said on Saturday that she would "think cooking" before becoming a presidential candidate following a midterm election.
When the answer was open to the people in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider competing.
"It's time for a woman to head to Washington and improve our broken government and this includes putting a woman on top of her," she said in a The Hill report.
"After November 6th, I'll think about it with its urgency to become a presidential candidate."
Warren expressed his concern for President Donald Trump when it comes to open answers, saying that Trump "was driving our country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing about our democracy," he said.
Warren has criticised Trump for running for Brett Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Federal Court.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said, "We need an FBI investigation before the vote is made."
However, greetings from a poll on Thursday showed the majority of the population in the area represented by Warren felt Warren was not eligible to compete in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not compete, according to a survey by the University Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Studies Center.
Thirty-two percent supported him.
The poll also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to compete, with 38 percent supporting him potentially to compete and 48 percent disagreed.
The name of other high-profile democrats who are also discussed as potential to compete in 2020 is former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would officially decide it by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin has announced her post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Track Palin at Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is facing, after returning home, I can feel the feelings of other families facing this PTSD problem and those who have come home with injuries," he said at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the incident of his son's detention was "something significant" and he said of his son and other war veterans as, "they came home different, quite hard and wondered if they would be honored for their sacrifices to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence over a woman, disrupting reports of domestic violence and having weapons when drunk, according to Dan Bennet, spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, Washington supports boating against new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support to oppose a U.S. policy that prevents asylum to victims fleeing attacks on terror groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and regions made a friend's registration to a court on Friday in Washington to support a asylum applicant who opposes this policy, NBC news reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. The suit session made by the American Civil Freedom Union filed in August against the federal policy has not yet been disclosed.
He said his partner and "his son's violent group" had injured him but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
Grace-backed state prosecutors described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, with the number of people most demanding asylum in the U.S., as a country filled with problems of bad groups and domestic violence.
The new policy of the U.S. asylum application returns a decision made in 2014 in which the Refugee Appeals Board has allowed refugees fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Columbia's Attorney General in a statement on Friday said the new policy "does not apply state, federal and international laws that have existed decades ago."
"The federal law requires all applications for asylums to be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances that lead to the application, and prevents them from violating that principle," a friend told the court.
Prosecutors also disputed the policy that preventing entry of immigrants would worsen the U.S. economy by saying the possibility of these migrants becoming entrepreneurs and "being the required labor."
Prosecutors Jeff Sessions have directed immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims who fled due to domestic violence and because of the violence of malicious groups in June.
The asylums will be given to those who leave their homeland for fear of being oppressed for racism, racism, nationality or for membership of certain social groups or holding to a different political holdings," Sessions said when announcing the policy on June 11.
Ascension is not aimed at solving all problems -- even if all problems are serious -- that everybody in the world is facing every day.
Rescue work is becoming more rampant in Palu while death tolls increase double
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is giving birth to her son who has a fever at the city centre of Palu, who has been kidnapped.
"Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
There's very little water."
The residents seemed to gradually return to their ravenous homes, looking for their belongings in the water while trying to save what could be.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by an earthquake at a magnitude of 7.5 which was too devastating.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered a spinal and shoulder fracture, rest outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside as a result of an aftershock.
His tears flowed as he scanned back as the quake shook the five-storey room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There's nothing to save us.
I was narrowed down the wall that collapsed, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife's voice calling for help, then she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and son.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘blowning' with ‘propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper detailing the common good of trade between the U.S. - China, U.S. Ambassador to China accused China of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to Chinese Daily's paid advertising in the Des Moines Register newspaper - the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing the Chinese state of attempting to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, an allegation China denied.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. election explained what U.S. officials reported to Reuters as a new phase in a campaign to pressure China.
Being an ordinary practice for foreign governments to broadcast ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now arguing in a worsening trade war with each putting tariffs on their imports.
China's initial action in this trade war was to target exporters in countries like Iowa supporting the Republican Party represented by Trump, Chinese and US state experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said the move had troubled many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a press room in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, wrote, "it's more bullying by broadcasting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In broadcasting this propaganda, the Chinese government accepted the freedom practiced by America, a tradition that prioritized freedom of speech and press freedom," Branstad wrote.
"In the press in Beijing, however, there is very little opposition voice and you can't see the people's real views on China's concerned ecological direction because their media is under strict control by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the major newspapers in China avoids an offer to publish" his article, although he did not state which newspaper one.
Republicans slammed women's vote ahead of mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh's story, a warning by analysts
While many prominent Republicans supported and sided with the Federal Court's Brett Kavanaugh candidate facing charges of sexual harassment, analysts warned they would invite a response specifically from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
High emotions cover this story and most Republicans say in their record will continue with voting.
These things cannot be changed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell's University of Syracuse in an article published on Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher is unsure of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) move to force the FBI to start an investigation is enough to silence the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget about it tomorrow as well as in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the Progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" while protesting at the Senate building stalls when Republicans who control the Justice Committee voted to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimonials from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic aggression and motivation will explode," Stu Rothenberg, a free political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's too high; it's true.
This may be higher especially for women who will vote from suburban and young voters, 18-29, they do not like the president and rarely vote.
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against him by the Federal Court's candidate, analysts thought it would be an infringement if the Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This has become something very complicated for the GOP," said Micheal Steela, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC news.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh succeeds as a federal judge, it's also about the way Republicans subscribe to the matter and the way they serve him," said Guy Cecil, USA's director of Priorities, a group that helped select Democrats to the news broadcast.
However, the American people seem to be divided into two and do not know to believe who in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony with more than half sided with Ford.
YouGov's latest review showed 41 percent said they would believe or may believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed or might believe Kavanaugh.
38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh might or must have lied in his testimonials, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is now investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other allegation, reports Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian.
Last week Ford made an oath in front of the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh accused him of being drunk when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez also said the Federal Court's candidate also showed his pub in front of Ford while a party while he was demanding at Yale University around the 1980s.
World Website Creator Designs to Start a New Internet Network to Connect with Google and Facebook
World Website Creator, Tim Berners-Lee launched a startup company to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that uses open source based software Solid creation Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real goal was "to rule the world."
"We need to do this now," he said of the company.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain a list of contacts, daily work lists, calendars, song lists and other personal professional fittings.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that's available in one browser and simultaneously.
What's unique about data storage in this personal tall is that it's up to the user for who can access the type of information required.
The company certifies it "personal control through data."
Ihlam for Inrupt, according to his CEO John Bruce, is to bring certain resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who are contracted to work on this project and a voluntary code writer community.
Starting this week, tech builders from all over the world can create their own free apps without being centered on any location by using the tools found in the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee also said he and his team had no discussions with "Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce a change in which all their business models will change immediately."
“We are not asking for their truth.”
In an issue in Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, "His mission is to provide a business and ecosystem energy to help protect the intergrity and quality of new websites built using Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the world of the Internet when he founded the World Web Site Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has debated about the need for a website to be free.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Website Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic for the new era of the website,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: First World War Victoria Cross recipient priest celebrated
The only priest from the Church of England who received the Victoria Cross award during the First World War as a combat soldier was celebrated in the hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Paderi Benard Vann, who received this award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenlise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a gunman four days later and did not immediately know he had ever known that he had been awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone has been erected and opened curtains by two of his grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "a brilliant silhouette" because the stone would open an even blind 100 years since his grandfather's daring act.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on September 29, 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann carried his battalion across the de Saint-<0x51>uentin Canal "filled with thick pomegranates and countered with a massive rounded attack."
He then traversed to the border and with "extraordinary courage" and led him before jumping on his own rifle and shooting at three people.
Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German gunman on 4 October 1918 - a month before the war ended.
Micheal Vann, 72, said her grandfather's actions were "something that I couldn't possibly be able to repeat and so intriguing."
He and his sister Dr James Vann also laid a floral necklace after the launch led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Pancaramam.
Micheal Vann said "it is highly respected to participate in this event" and added "true courage with the support that so many people have given."
MMA fans keep watch all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they are given Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206 but are disappointed from watching the main show.
San Jose's list of 13 matches, including six major matches to be aired live every night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to hang out, audiences in the UK were surprised when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig's show.
Some of them were angry because they kept watch all night to watch this match.
One of the fans said the exchange to the children's cartoon channel "a joke that doesn't disappoint" through his ciapan.
"The government's regulations show broadcasts at 6 a.m. are not suitable for matches so they have to broadcast for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications Bellator when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa is Khinzir," yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they are trying to reschedule broadcasts so that audiences in the UK can watch it.
"I think when I'm talking about re-publishing, I think we can do something," Coker said.
“But at six a.m. on Sunday it is impossible for us to do anything until Sunday, which is Monday their time.
We're working on it.
Trust me, when the post is converted, there are a lot of text relays and it's not good to hear.
We are trying to solve this problem, we think this is a technical problem.
But no, it's more about the government.
I promise this won't happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six - as usual - and we're trying to do something that's impossible for fans.
It's a poor situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's sense of "low self-esteem" towards sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with a low self-esteem due to his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old didn't realize anything until he went to high school and felt "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she spoke about gay rights to give "hopeful" to others.
He also spoke after his father's title, he was not very interested in winning at the Olympic Games.
The presenter remains in this long-running plan, Kris Young vacations for several months due to illness.
His sudden appearance in Laverne's first plan, Daley said he felt "less than" peers when he grew up because "he was not socially accepted as a man or a woman."
"To this day, feeling less than others and feeling differently than others is the thing that has encouraged me and gave me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner is now a high-profile champion who campaigns for the LBGT and has used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year so that more countries will no longer make homosexuality a crime.
He said he was talking like this because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give others "hope" like him.
The three-time world champion said the event fell in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - was "unprecedented straight"
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than her last year but said their age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so much experience at such a young age" - he joined the first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone in this age environment who went through the same challenges.
The couple became father in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said "all the presupposes" of his life have now changed.
"If you asked me last year, it's just about 'I need to win the gold medal'," he said.
"There's really something more than an Olympic gold medal.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley said his father didn't want to accept the statement that he was about to die and one of the last things he asked was whether their tickets to London 2012 were already purchased - because he wanted to sit in front of him once.
"I didn't reach the heart to say 'Daddy won't be there to sit the front row'," he said.
"I still hold my father's hand when he stops breathing and not until my father stops breathing and has passed away I just realized that my father won't live forever," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I realize this is what I dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of my fans in my own country in the Olympic Games, there's nothing else to be able to match this," he said.
It was also a source of inspiration for her first song choice - "Proud" by Heather Small - who co-founded her during preparations for the Olympics and still made her roost.
Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is not ready to face the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will create a new record this Sunday when he plays for 47 times in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to be ready to recoup the game's performance so as not to end up with grief.
Mickelson who will play in this biennial event for a record 12 times, has been relegated by captain Jim Furyk for "fourballs" and "foursomes" games on Saturday.
Behind being a focus as usual for the United States, this top five-match winner spends time becoming a cheerleader and practicing in hopes of improving the quality of the game.
A man who can't hit the ball straight even when he's at the top of his game, this 48-year-old is not the right choice for the Le Golf National golf course, where his long distance is very difficult for a shot that doesn't meet the target.
And if this golf course is only awkward, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday will compete with British Open winner Francesco Molinari who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the American player, losing four points starts with 12 single games, starting fiercely, then Mickelson's game is certainly very important.
He's so confident about his players, that's all he can say.
"He understands his role today, and pats his shoulders and puts his hand on my shoulder and says he's ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very high self-confidence.
He is well known and has contributed a lot to this team since then, and this week.
I may not have imagined that he will play in two games.
I think it's more than that, but that's how and how we think we should do it.
He wants to do the same, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's record for the most appearance in the Ryder Cup this Sunday.
This is probably the last time he will join the Ryder Cup that has never matched the achievement of his personal record.
Mickelson won 18 times, losing 20 times and seven series, although Furyk said his presence brought a spirit shot to his team.
"He's funny, he's joking, he's funny, he's funny, he's in the team room," she said.
"I think all the young players have fun with him, this week, and it's fun to see him.
He's not just playing, but more than that.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows their position ahead will soon be lost.
The European team captain, Thomas Bjorn, knew from his experience that a far-forward position could be lost in the last day of the Ryder Cup and made the situation difficult.
The Danish player first joined the 1997 match at Valderrama, where Sever Ballesteros drove as captain and ahead of the American team with 5 points but was only able to win very thinly once with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself after a position ahead of Valderrama; we also got ahead at Brookline but we lost and at Valderram we won, but we won thinly," Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 Class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to be ahead with a 10-6 point count at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in that team that this game is not yet over.
We're fighting all-out tomorrow.
Get out and play hard and don't make mistakes.
This is not over until the eyes have not been pinned and placed on the silt board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and we will focus on this goal.
I said, I'm going to focus on 12 players in our team, but we all have to realize who we are - they are the greatest players in the world.
So happy with the achievements of his men on the golf course that was so difficult, Bjorn added: "I couldn't stand.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow the individual's accomplishments need to be snarled and that's something different to do.
It's great to be out there with friends and when everything goes well but when you're alone, your full capacity as a golfer will be tested.
Here's a message that all players need to hear, give the best in you tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he needs to give the best in him as well."
Contrary to Bjorn's view, his opponent Jim Furyk would expect his players to play well as an individual player compared to the team's events, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to score three points out of four points.
Furyk himself had an experience on the last day in which the position changed, when he was in a winning team at Brookline before losing shock when the European team performed "the Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word," he said when answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999 burned the spirit of the player on the last day.
"We have 12 more events tomorrow, but if you all want to start it as fast as you can see in Brookline, as you can see in Medina.
When the momentum begins, it will put pressure on the event in the middle.
We're going to sort out our players according to the one we feel fit, we're going to try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of fighting back and colliding with Rory McIlroy in the main event, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter European players who are in the top spot of the first part.
"I'm making this rule because I think it's going to stick to and cover everything," Bjorn said of the individual player's choice.
New German warships delayed again.
The German Navy should accept its latest frigates in 2014 to replace the Cold War era warship, but the ship will not be ready until next year due to system damage and rising costs, according to local media reports.
The monitoring of the "Rhineland-Pfalz" warship, the first ship under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigat brand has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing military speakers.
This warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately the post-mortem problem struck the fate of the big project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate warships booked by the Navy in 2007 would replace the Bremen-class frigate.
Understandably, it will contain features such as high-powered cannons, a wide range of anti-flight and antitypical equipment as well as some of the characteristics of contamination such as reducing detection by radar, red light and acaustic capabilities.
Other important features are the longer duration of maintenance - this latest frigate must be able to sail up to two years from its base.
However, a variety of obstacles meant this sophisticated warship said to be able to highlight German power abroad - will be outdated by the time the ship joins the Navy's service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate Frigat F125 was headlined last year, when German Navy officials did not want to monitor the warship in and return it to the construction company Blohm <0x26> Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to its builders after the shipment.
Not much is known why the ship was repatriated, but German newspapers called some damage to the "ware and device" making this warship useless if it was sent for combat missions.
The damage to the software should be taken heavy because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship will be operated by only 120 classes - half of which are needed to handle the old Bremen class frigate.
There is also a matter where the warship is too heavy and this will reduce performance and limit the ability of the Navy to make any improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tan "Rheinland-Pfalz" warship is believed to be twice as heavy as the same-class warship ever used by German troops during World War II.
In addition to damage to devices, the overall cost of the project - including training for classes - is also an issue.
The project is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - increasing from its original price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion Euro.
The problem with this latest frigates warship shows how far the German naval capabilities are missed.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy is facing the problem of a lack of a powered warship.
The officer also said the issue is getting worse, as long-time warships that have been halted do not have a replacement warship.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is living a life
Recent studies are being conducted in an est in Scotland's highlands aimed to explain why bats use the shape of the face of the earth to hunt for food.
It is expected that this study will lead to the latest findings on the unique mammal behaviors that are attempting to fly and can be a guide for conservation activities.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular bats, and pipstrelles soprano bats as well as long-earned brown bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
Special silverware will be placed in certain locations around the property to track the activity of the bats throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also make moving surveys using mobile detection tools.
Experts analyze the sound of all recordings will identify the frequency of each type of bat and its species and the action of these bats.
A map of habitats and reports will be produced to create a picture of the earth's surface on the behavior of the bat.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes the study's results will show the most important habitat area to the bats and the way they are used by each species of bats.
This information will help identify habitat management benefits such as making rainforests and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined a lot since the last century.
Collars are threatened as a result of building and construction work that disrupts the place of bats to reach and lose habitat.
Wind turbines and lights are also a risk to bats equal to flies trap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
Because the bats hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use location detection techniques using sound to identify the position of insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country is of great importance.
They have ten trained experts who often conduct surveys, check up places and sometimes save bats.
The organization has also established one of Scotland's first wildlife protection centers in Threave est in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the place where eight of Scotland's ten species live.
David Thompson, the est manager, said this est is the best place for bats.
"We've got a great place to stay," he said.
"We have old buildings, many large trees and suitable habitats.
Much more we don't know about bats, so the work we're running here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to live and thrive.
He stressed how important it is to conduct an examination before starting maintenance work in real estate because there is a possibility that inadvertently we could destroy a nest of bats that would contain bats in which it was capable of killing 400 female bats and bats, and possibly destroying the entire population of local bats.
The bat is protected and is an error to kill, persecute or disturb or destroy the nested nesting place.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help.
He said: "There's still a lot of things we need to learn about bats and for many species we don't know how their populations grow."
Ronaldo denied the charges of rape while his lawyer was preparing to sue German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges were raped on him as "fake news" and said there were people who wanted to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sue German magazine Der Spiegel who published the charges.
Portugal and Juventus are accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He said he had paid <0x24>375,000 to close the victim's mouth according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in a video of Instagram Live to 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news."
"It's not true.
What they're saying today is fake news," said the 5-winner Ballon d'Or to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
Frequently.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, this is part of my work.
"I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue De Spiegel on the charges, which they titled "an unfounded and disruptive report of private space," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for "moral damages that directly disrupt his personality, which may have been one of the most serious personal rights abuses in recent years."
The incident was reported in June 2009 in a luxury room of Hotel Palms and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reportedly returning to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of cheating on the woman without permission, according to an investigation paper registered at the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed after the incident the player was kneeling in front of him and said he was "99 percent" a "good man" and just fell for "one percent."
The document confirms Ronaldo claims to have sex, but on the basis of likes the same.
Mayorga also claimed he made a police report and took a picture of the injuries he suffered while in the hospital, but later agreed to settle it outside the court because he was "afraid of the response" and was concerned about being "failed by the public."
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel the previous solution because she is still traumatized by what has happened.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester when this charge occurred, and this summer he has moved to Italian football giant Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever' for losing car manufacturer
The UK "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in post-Brexit car production, Commerce Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added this was somewhat "surprising" because Toyota UK told the BBC if Britain left the European Union without a solution, it would stop production of its manufactured car in Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
"We need a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of this would result in shipping problems on the border if there was no solution for Brexit and this would lead to job loss.
The factory in Burnaston - which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis cars - installed nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90<0x25> of them exported to other European Union countries.
"In my view if Britain is out of the European Union without a solution by the end of March, we will stop the production of cars in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota affairs in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar and Land Rover, have also said their concerns if the UK exits the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trading will work.
For example, BMW said they would close their Mini car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risk of supply networks in the event of Brexit without any solution.
The production of Toyota cars depends on the basis of installation based on timely supply receipts without having to be stored with the car parts brought into the factory every 37 minutes from the UK and the European Union for the car booked.
If the UK exits the European Union without a solution on March 29, it is likely that there will be a clash on the border that industry players predict will be suspended and lack of replacement materials.
Toyota is unlikely to be able to store inventory supplies for more than a day at Derbyshire factory, the company said, then production will be stopped.
Mr Clark said the future plan of Finance Minister Theresa May on bilateral relations with the European Union "must be made with ticks to avoid any examinations on the border."
"We need a solution. We want a solution that will enable not only success for the present but for us to overcome this opportunity," he told the BBC on Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence is not only from Toyota but also the other manufacturers suggest that we need to continue this very successful supply network.
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but over the long term warns of rising costs and reducing the competitiveness of the factory and so on will result in job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the union responsible for the management of the unit at the factory, said the union members have begun to worry: "According to my experience, the lost work will never return.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have put forward a precise and strong plan for future relations between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and deputy prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be "rejected to next week" due to a dispute over Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy as a future federal court candidate, according to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein, who oversees the work of Robert Mueller's special attorney investigations on Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's and Russia's aides and the possibility of preventing justice by the President.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy prosecutor or not and then disrupt Mueller's freedom to continue the investigation has become Washington's hottest gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein was planning to wear a secret silverware to record his conversation with Trump and likely to replace the president by using an amendment to 25 constitutions.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he was forced to go to the White House, behind reports that he said he would resign.
Instead it was announced a meeting on Thursday with Trump at the time being in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "unwilling" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid him being in contact with Kavanaugh's recognition and Dr Christine Blassey Ford, one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of molesting him, before the Senate judicial committee, both of whom they gave recognition.
On Friday, Trump directed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, this has suspended a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared in Fox's news on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, perhaps in this week, I think it may be postponed another week as some things are going on in the federal court.
Let's look at it later and I'll always give you the latest information to the newspaper.
Some reporters will argue that Sanders has not held any White House press conference since September 10.
When his host, Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said he didn't hold a lot of press conferences not because he didn't like TV publishers who were trying to find "attention" but he also said: "I don't agree because they really want attention."
Then he said the relationship between the press and Trump will increase.
"The president has held the most answer sessions compared to the presidents before him," he said without providing any evidence.
The press conference will remain held, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, it is better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen us have done a lot of that since last week and this will replace a press conference when you can speak directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from newspapers when on his way out of the White House or when taking part in an open answer question session or during a media conference along with honorary guests.
Media gatherings are very rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he sometimes made an appearance independently and strangely in the presence of the gathered reporters.
Health Secretary writes to European Union employees in the NHS about their concerns about Brexit
The secretary-general has written a letter to all workers from the European Union working in NHS Scotland to express their gratitude for the country and hope they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter degant for less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government has also committed to bear the costs for the application of resident European Union citizens working in its public sector.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union regarding the withdrawal have continued, and are heading towards a decision by the end of the autumn.
But the UK government has stepped up preparations to face a scenario without a solution.
I know it's something that's really worrying about you all.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate each of you's contributions, regardless of your citizenship.
Employers from across the European Union and other countries, bring together many experiences and expertise that strengthen and improve health services and provide benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you all to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Follows Emergency Surgery After Accident Injury In Her Head
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury after losing 31-27 with Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the second half.
"He approached the edge line and suddenly collapsed there," Reed said.
The coach and health officer gave Abercrombie oxygen there before placing him in the intestine and taking him for further treatment.
An official from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/how far he is injured at the moment" and that Tennessee State is trying to identify when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the first year of red shirt, played in the first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He has done five goals on Saturday before coming out of the game, his number of goals this season is 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp duty when they purchase property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK and this surplus of money will be used to help homeless under Tory's latest plan.
This step will strengthen Corbyn's success to attract young voters.
These stamps will be charged on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Treasury is expected to quote up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK - money from this will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
This move seemed to strengthen Jeremy Corbyn's success to attract young voters with the promise of providing affordable housing and making high-income people a target.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, money from these results will help the government deal with the problem of people who do not have a residence.
This addition - is an addition to the stamp duty that has already been imposed including the higher duty that had been introduced two years ago on the second house and the house purchased for rent that may be charged three percent.
The treasury is expected to be able to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year through this move.
An estimated 13 percent of London's new properties are purchased by those who are not UK citizens, causing prices to rise and make it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Most of the luxurious areas - especially in the capital - have become a "sunyyi" because many of the owners are foreign owners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was just announced a few weeks after Boris Johson demanded that stamp duty be reduced so that more young people could buy their first home.
He accused the large construction company of intentionally maintaining high real estate prices by buying land but not developing it, and breastfeeding Mrs May to remove the quota on the house capable of dealing with Britain's "humiliating housing problems".
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of interesting housing reform proposals, including rental control and repealing "innocent" expulsion.
He also wants more power to be given to members of the council to build a new house.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my time as prime minister to restore British dreams - this life must be improved for every generation to come.
And that means improving our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair because it is very easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad to buy homes compared to the British people who work hard here.
For too many people, the dream of owning your own home is very far away, and the fact of living in an even place with shame is indeed a reality.
Jack Ross: ‘My main goal is to manage Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa said his "main goal" was to be Scotland's manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scots are looking forward to a challenging opportunity to re-scor the North-East club which is third in League One, less than three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to represent the country as a player.
"I got a call for B cap and so far," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportound.
"I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there was something that always drew me there.
That would only come if I succeeded as a manager at the club level.
Ross' replacements as Sunderland managers included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athenic said he did not feel the urgency in the footsteps of such a famous name at big clubs, as he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me the sense of success at this point is ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, it should be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I'll think I'm successful if I can get this club back into the Premier League."
Ross is only three years in management, after being a manager's assistant at Dumbarton and being one of the coaches at Hearts' for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa return to level three after being relegated and changing St Mirren's fate from being relegated to Champion the following season.
And Ross said he's very comfortable now compared to being a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's an option," he recalls, when he manages Alla.
"I know that the game is different from playing with me.
It may sound strange because I'm successful, I can live and enjoy some interesting moments.
Playing is a bit difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of pressure and pressure working as a player but as a manager I'm more comfortable.
I’ve always wanted to take care and now I’m doing it, and I’m comfortable doing something I like throughout my adult life.”

The best time to drink beer is at 5.30pm on Saturday, according to a study
This summer's heat wave brings luck to British pubs facing problems but a series of restaurants are under pressure.
Pub and bar groups showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but at restaurants it fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consulting firm who gathered these figures, said: "Continuous heat and a longer England World Cup campaign means July will follow the June pattern, where the pubs rise by 2.8 percent, unless the restaurants are declining worse.
A 1.8 percent drop in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
The pub performance that prioritizes drinks and bars is very strong compared to the declining restaurant.
Pubs that prioritize food also experience bad luck due to hot weather, but are not as bad as restaurant operators.
Most people just want to drink beer.
Pubs and bars recorded a 6.6 per cent increase in sales for the month, while food fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for entertainment and food from RSM, said: "This decision seems to be the same and continues since the end of April.
Weather and social events or sporting events are still a major factor in increasing sales in outdoor markets.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to be narrowed, sales dropped by 4.8 percent if compared to the year to the year it would be even worse with the cost pressure again.
The long summer weather has hit restaurant operators at a bad time and only time will determine if the colder weather as we experience in August will bring relief."
The increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July showing moisture in newly introduced brands.
Observers for the sales sector at the UK pub, bars and restaurants The Coffee Peach Tracker collects and analyzes the performance of data from 47 groups operating with a <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion turnover is an industry benchmark.

Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice to athletes" in the Scottish Athletics agency
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletics board as non-executive director during the general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most famous Scottish racing athlete and chairman Ian Beattie explains this move is an opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from Doyle's extensive international experience for more than a decade.

Mother's milk pump advertising that makes comparisons with cows bring conflicting opinions online
A milk pump manufacturer got a wide range of contradictory opinions online because of their ads comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows being leached for milk.
To launch what it says "the world's first silent and wearable mother's milk pump" consumer technology company Elvie released a joke-shaped music video to show the freedom that mothers who use this new pump can feel.
Four mothers danced in a straw-filled cow ward to a song in which the lyrics read: "Yes, I'm a milk pump yourself, but you can't see any tail" and "if you don't realize this isn't a nipple, it's my breast."
He said, "I'm going out, I'm going to suck my kids, I'm out, I'm out, I'm pumping my breasts."
However, this advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, the video has invited a variety of reactions from the public, many who say it gives a cheerful overview of the "surprising" dairy industry.
"It's an inappropriate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows need snails and need to give birth to a child to produce milk, but unfortunately cows are divorced from cow mothers within a few days of their birth," said one author.

Another commented: "Sememangys is a trauma for cows and cows.
"But what do you say to use them to advertise milk pumps for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another added: "An advertisement that doesn't have to do anything directly."
Another person defended the ad, with a woman claiming that she found the song "really ridiculous."
“I think this is a genius idea.
I'll buy one if I still give my body milk.
It makes me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I think it's as good as it is.
"It's a genius product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny advertisement aimed at a pumping mother (Always at work or in the toilet) and feels like a "flame."
This is not an advertisement that praises or assesses the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all had been dancing with hidden pumps in their underwear.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the response that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's Pump is completely quiet, has no wire or tubes and can be loaded hidden in a breastfeeding shirt, giving women the freedom to move, holding their baby, and also out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "Elvie's Pam is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By equating women who are pumping with milk cows, we want to put body milk packing and all the challenges associated with it as a primary focus, while showing an entertaining and hooking way to feel free through the use of new pumps.
This is not the first time Ellie's pump became a news headline.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother to two children appeared on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Children's Refugees Turn Silently to Camp Camp in Texas Borderlands
The number of migrants detained has increased even though the monthly border transfer has not changed much, due to the rhetoric and heavy policies introduced by the Trump administration, making child placement with guarantors increasingly difficult.
According to tradition, guarantors are undocumented immigrants, and they are afraid to affect their position to continue living in the country if they take a child.
The risk rose in June, when federal authorities announced that future guarantors and other adult members in the family would have to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, told Congress that the agency had detained dozen individuals who had applied to be guarantors for unguarded children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those detained had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either guarantors or family members of guarantors, are here illegally and most of them are unauthorized immigrants.
With that, we will continue to hunt those individuals," Albence said.
In order to process children more quickly, authorities introduced new regulations requiring some of them to appear in court within a month to be detained, not after 60 days according to previous standards, according to protection workers.
Many will be present through a video conference call, from being personally present, to appeal their case for a legitimate position before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer the child is under custody, they will be more likely to become anxious or depressed, and this will lead to a retaliatory action or an attempt to escape, according to protection officials and according to reports issued by the system in recent months.
Supporters said that the concerns were higher in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that children struggling with feelings might not be detected, as the size of the place was.
They added that by shifting children to the camp town without preparing time for them to be emotionally prepared, or saying goodbye to friends might worsen the trauma they face.
U.S., France and Turkey withdraw immediately
Speaking at the United Nations General Conference, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return, even though wars in the country have reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also held the position of deputy prime minister, said foreign troops on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism "will be subject to appropriate action."
"They should immediately and unconditionally withdraw," he told the conference.
Moualem said the "war on terrorism has ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred war until we removed Syria" from both violent groups and "any foreign occupation".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, specializing in training and counseling the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the land of the war.
On the issue of the escape, Moualem said the situation was appropriate for them to return, and he accused "some outside countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that caused the escapees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is held between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomat said the agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide military-free zones in Idlib rebel-controlled areas has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
Russia-Turkey talks have diverted a major attack by a Russian-backed Syrian army in a region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, said the agreement had a "real time limit" and expected military action to target jihadists including rebels from the Nusra Front linked to Al <0x51>aeda, which "will be abolished."
The UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to arrange the first meeting for a new committee, which contains the government and opposition members to draft post-war mining and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "featuring current constitutional articles," and warned of disruption.
Trump wins second term
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, as expected by liberal observers, allegations of dismissal and scandal ended his presidential post before his time.

At the moment, there is no sign of snoring.
Since 2014, the prime time rating has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average viewership of 2.4 million, an additional of 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" had preceded the cable rating, up to 3.5 million viewers on the evening of the premier news.
"This is a fire that attracts people's attention because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC drama "Designated Survivor," a story about cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has other theories.
He recalled a taxi trip before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,' Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is a value of entertainment in the game.

External money flows into a fierce mid-term election council
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th election shows a flood of money, as the reunification of congressional districts shows two incumbents now competing for the same seat.
Pittsburgh's reprinted subbandar area rivals Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in a special spring election.
Lamb competes against another incumbent, Republican representative Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th area of old Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The map was reprinted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old area had been digerrymanded after the Republicans.
The match in the new 17 has started a fierce financial campaign competition between the main party financial machinery of the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became the name commonly heard in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in Mac's special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat was won by the Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 points.
Political intelligence has given the Democrats an edge.
U.S. estimates to postpone El Savador due to support for China, then back
Dominica and Panama's Republican diplomats have recognized Beijing, with little negative response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until a partner pulled out the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the Government Department decided to call back the chairman of American diplomatic representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the latest decision not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only imposed on El Salvador, which received a budget of <0x24>140 million in American aid in 2017, including narcotics control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and visa restraints aimed at, will have a negative impact on the Central American country with high levels of disruption and murder.
After internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials reaffirmed a high-level conference that focused on economic safety and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administrative officials decided that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively halting any considerations to fine El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now give a speech at the conference, scheduled in mid-October, as a sign of imports of administrative places in the meeting, according to diplomats.
And the three American representatives returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no firm message or fine from Washington.
White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on the condition of anonymity.
Their description is supported by external analysts who are close to administration and also speak on the terms of validity.
The History Study
The next thing to happen may be Robert Mueller's special lawyer's report on the possibility of a justice barrier by Trump, where there is now strong evidence in the general record.
Mueller will also allow investigations to investigate whether Trump's campaign has joined Russia in an attack on our election.
If Congress exchanges hands, Trump will face responsibilities on the party, as soon as he is ready to face the voter, and perhaps eventually a jury containing his counterpart.
It's all that, and I'm not saying that Trump's downfall is definitely going to happen - or people like him in Europe.
There are options that all of us have to make in both Atlantic sides that will have an impact on how long this struggle is.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to attempt a coup against Hitler, if the West did not follow Hitler and support Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and have missed the opportunity to avoid the brutal killings that took place in the next few years.
The journey of history revolves around the point of such inflection, and the unstoppable journey of democracy will be accelerated or suspended.
The American people are facing some point of this inflection right now.
What would we do if Trump fired Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controlled the determination of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has had problems since the newspaper made a report that, last year, he had planned to make a presidential record and speculate that the president was not eligible for the post.
Rosenstein said the Times was not accurate.
"How would we act if the FBI's new inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or unfair - or if he was confirmed to the Court of Appeal despite any apparent charges of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And more importantly, are we going to vote for a congressional referendum on which Trump will be held accountable?
If we fail in the test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish family who had been expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who had conquered my embassy house.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with swastika.
With that as my legacy, how am I not optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers Optimistic about battle with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win against Austria, following a series with Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify them in the G Group in the European League.
An injury to the knee prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season to a 2-2 series with Villarreal, but he believed the Rangers used this decision as a stepping stone for a great victory.
"It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We played in this game with the confidence we're going to get something and we've got one eye.
We may win at the end of the game, but the series may be a fairer result.
They might play better in the first half and we played better in the second half and in the better side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
"We hope we get three points but the game is difficult because they got good results in the previous game but, the audience supports us, I'm sure we'll play well and get positive results.
Last year it was really hard, between everything that happened to my injury, and the aggression in the club but there was a fun factor about this place right now.
The squad is good and the team feels good; the training is also good.
We hope we can do our best, leave last season and succeed."

Although the review participants had a real idea of the way they wanted to be maintained, some had already talked to their family members about it.
Half of the industrious in the State study stated that they had talked with their partner about long-term maintenance costs.
Only 10 percent talk to their children about it.
"They want family members to take care of them but not take steps to discuss," said Holly Snyder, deputy president of the statewide insurance business.
Here is a way to start.
Talk to your partner and your child: you won't be able to provide family care for you if you don't tell them first.
Working with your counselor and your family to discuss places and how to get care, as the choice will be an important factor to know the cost.
Take your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you get a way to pay for the expenses.
Funds for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help protect these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Complete your legal documents: Finish the legal war at a time.
Set a health care representative in place so that you can appoint an individual you trust to oversee your health care and make sure a professional according to your will if you can't communicate.
Also consider the authority letter of the deputy for your finances.
You will choose the person you trust to make a decision for you and make sure your bills are paid if you don't.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your mother has a medical emergency and on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami breaking the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the number of deaths is expected to rise.
With the absence of a communications system, authorities were unable to obtain information from the government of Dongala, the northern area of Palu near the epicenter of an earthquake with a magnitude 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating its 40th anniversary as earthquakes and tsunamis hit.
Dongala government area 300 km (180 miles) off the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The territory, the administrative region under the territory, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and ranching became the economic backbone of the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the waters of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but is concentrated only in Morowali, on the beaches opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been plagued by Tsumani several times in 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Tsunami also struck west of Dongala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is located seismically in the Pacific Fire Circle and has always been hit by an earthquake.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western region of Acheh, Indonesia north of Sumatra on 26 Dec has triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the waters of the Indian Ocean, half of that number in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang City, the capital of West Sumatra region.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A simple quake struck the Pidie Jaya government area of Acheh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the massive destruction of earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered at the time, but more than 100 were killed due to the collapse of the building.
2018: A powerful earthquake hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, especially in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded at the time.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son of former Alaskan governor candidate Sarah Palin, has been detained on charges of carrying out the attack.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was detained, suspected of carrying out domestic attacks, disrupting reports of domestic violence crimes and opposing detention, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, while a female friend was trying to make a police call to report the criminal charges, she had taken the phone from the woman.
Palin was held remand at Mat-Su's pre-talk facility and held with an unrestricted bond amounting to <0x24>500, KTU reported.
He was confronted in court on Saturday, where he had admitted "certainly, not guilty" when asked about recognition, the network reported.
Palin faces three small Class A mistakes, meaning he will probably be jailed for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He has also been charged under a small Class B offence, can be sentenced a day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time a criminal charge has been charged against Palin.
In December 2017, the young man was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report on the allegations of the attack.
This case is called in the Alaska Army Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic attacks, disrupting reports of domestic violence crimes and having weapons in a drunken state related to the incident.
The girl's boyfriend claimed that the man had punched her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by a group of veteran soldiers in 2016 after linking her child's violent actions to PTSD following her service in Iraq.
Tsunami of Indonesia earthquake: hundreds killed
At least 384 securities have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical supplies and communications networks are also affected by the death toll expected to rise in the next day.
Earth gepas hit outside Tangah Sulawesi located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media showed at the time of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach celebrating a party in the city of Palu as a tsunami struck the coast.
Prosecutors demand extraordinary death penalty for NYC terror attack suspects
New York prosecutors have called for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the New York City suspect of a terror attack that killed eight people -- an extraordinary sentence no longer run in the state has been called for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, pedestrians and cyclists on its way to Oct.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov was "intense" killing eight of the victims and "intense" wearing serious body injuries, according to notices with intent to prosecute the death penalty, was filed in Southern District, New York.
Both charges led to the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury has charged Saipov with 22 charges including eight counts of murder caused by illegal activities, which were always used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one allegation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "scientific planning and planning", according to prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "trouble, cruel and contemptuous."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, pain, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the intention notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has long claimed the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes has been charged with murdering two drug dealers but has finally been sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed on the New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been subjected to the sentence after they were convicted of conducting surveillance for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was sentenced to death by electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistan citizen, did not feel guilty on the day and month after the attack according to court documents.
He made a statement to the investigator that he was happy with what he was doing, according to the police.
Saipov said he was encouraged to conduct an attack after seeing ISIS videos on the phone, according to the allegations.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal martial lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "really disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We felt the decision to prosecute the death penalty compared to receiving a guilty confession for a lifelong piracy sentence with no possibility of being released, only prolonging the trauma of this event for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
According to Tory MP, NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for conducting Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to "move the people's troops" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
Former head of Ukip said politicians should "feel the bahang" from ‘Eurosceptics' - as one of Theresa May's MPs, suggesting she should be given the responsibility of handling negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would "get out now" if Farage became Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by May is to resolve the split between members who support the Tories Remain Member who joined the protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is working to ensure the ceasefire of Chequers remains in execution amid attacks from Brexiteer, Remain and the EU.
May's allies are in talks with Brussels despite the effects faced - and Eurosceptic and Labour's powers to choose between his packages or the 'disambiguation'.
Bone told the assembly out meant to go out at Solihull who wanted to "throw Chequers".
He recommended Farage to be nobility and was given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he's given that responsibility, we're out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit but we have to throw out Chequers."
Setting a protest against the EU, he said: 'We don't fight in the world war to be a slave.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone has rejected the proposal that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that British people have changed their minds and want to remain inaccurate at all.'
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also followed the march, told reporters: 'I just said: Prime Minister, listen to the people's voices.
"Chequers are not popular among public audiences, the Opposition will not vote in support, it is not popular in our party and the activities that are on the streets and who have voted on us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The prime minister will continue to hold their positions if they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians need to "feel the bahang" if they want to betray the decisions made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a belief between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we won't allow them to miss out on doing so.'
In a message to a passionate audience he added: "I want you to make our political class, which almost betrays Brexit, to feel its jaws.
“We are preparing for the army of the people who gave us victory in Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom free, have our own government, are proud.”
Meanwhile, Remainer marched through Birmingham before holding a meeting in the middle of the city.
A group of activists waved a Tories banner against Brexit after the group's launch at the end of the week.
Peer Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives about the security issues they faced with party applications during the conference.
"They said they could hold an IT system in place and all the technology with Canada and so on, for borders without contradiction, for trade without borders," he added.
"It's all annoying.
There's no such thing as Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "see" for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "see to compete for the presidential post" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that Democrats of Massachusetts delivered its future plans during a ‘town hall' in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, President Donald Trump's hardcore critic, was contesting for re-election in November with GOP state Rep candidate Geoff Diehl, who was joint chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts Trump campaign.
He is expected to compete with Trump in 2020.
Saturday's noon event in Holyoke is his 36th meeting with a guerrilla using the 'town hall' format since Trump's presidency.
One of the participants asked if he wanted to fight for the president.
Warren replied it's time for women to go to Washington to repair the damaged kingdom, and this includes a woman on the top of the ladder."

It was clearly apparent at the time, Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, "the direction of the Mercedes forces played an important role in this race.
From the start of the pitch, Bottas started well, almost defeating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel went into the pit first and left Hamilton in the traffic at the end of the group, something that was supposed to be final.
Mercedes then went into the pit in the next round and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tire action to the tires which left Ferrari drivers free at risk to defend themselves after a third-angle defensive action.
Max Verstappen started from the rear grid and was in seventh place after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then advanced for most of the race and did not change the tires to aim for a quick termination and intercepted Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He made his way into the pit in the 44th round but was unable to increase the speed for the next eight rounds when Raikkonen was in fourth place.
It was a tough day for Valtteri who had made a good race all weekend and was a gentleman allowing me to cross.
"The team has done a great job to win first and second place," Hamilton said.
That's not a good language.
President Donald Trump mocks Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday rally on a woman's insistence that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accused future Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not respond directly to the testimonials given before the Senate Judicial Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed people "big and ugly and liars."
"One thing that could happen and the beautiful thing happened a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and cruel and ugly and a liar," he said.
"When you look at exposure and leaks and they say "oh, I don't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you leaking?
Remember the answer... have you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaked."
Okay, wait a minute.
"We're leaking...No, we're not leaking," he added, making the senator's face expression.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Ford's Kavanaugholeh in July, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I don't deny Dr. Ford's accusations, I'm not leaking the story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"He told me to keep it as hard and I kept it as hard as requested."
But the woman's denial was disliked by the president, who gave a comment during Saturday's rally: "I told you, that's an inappropriate language of motion.
Maybe he didn't do that, but that's the worst motion language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Agong Court's candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charge to achieve their own goals.
"They want to regain power in any way.
You see, cruelty, cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrificed to gain power and control," Mediaite reported the president.

Air Traffic Controllers Killed to Ensure Hundreds on Aircraft Passed by Earthquake
Air Traffic Controllers in Indonesia are considered heroes after being killed after ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of passengers successfully displaced.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong winds continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his friend fleeing, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan the Great, refused to leave his control place in a powerful control tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport in Palu.
He did not step in to ensure that the 6321 Batik Air plane, which was on the runway at the time, could safely depart.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt the tower would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We provide helicopters from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take them to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost it this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
“Our hearts are broken to listen to this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is still rising due to many bodies still under the rubble and many inaccessible," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said.
A 6-metre-high uptick has destroyed Palu which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings back the body.
Clean water is hard to get.
Small shops are being scrambled everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Chairman of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "Indonesia's Red Cross Organization rushed to provide assistance to survivors but we didn't know what to find there.
This is a tragedy, but things can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to the transfer.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia has been hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says a passenger is missing after plane crashes
The airline, which operates a plane crashed in the Lagun Pacific in Micronesia, said a passenger was missing, after saying all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a broadcast that since Saturday afternoon, the company is uncertain about the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said the company was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to further details about the passengers, such as the age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into water during an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday, seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
What causes accidents and the course of real events is still unclear.
U.S. airlines and Navy said the plane landed in lagoons not far from the runway.
Some witnesses felt the plane was missing from the ground.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the aircraft entered the runway in low condition.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to cross the waist-high water to the emergency door of the sunken plane.
He said the flight attendants were in a state of panic and screaming, and he only had a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the crew nearby on the recovered dock also provided assistance by using re-engineered boats to move passengers to the beach before the plane sank into 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Flight Safety Network gave 111 people killed in a PNG-listed plane crash in the past two decades but no one involved Air Niugini.
Analysts give the nightline of women burned alive
The prosecutors restarted Saturday's case in a man's retaliation accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett gave evidence for several hours as an expert witness in the field of smart analysis.
He outlined the jury how he used a mobile phone record to organize the 29-year-old defendant <0x51>uinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he was killed.
Rowlett said he received some location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of his death, contradicting previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his cell phone along with Chambers' phone while he claimed along with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis said the truth, that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had "puzzled because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction is that Trellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before the woman's death.
Mobile phone records show that they know each other only a week.
Rowlett said after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted Chamber's call text and contact information from his phone.
"He's killed the woman from his life," Hale said.
The attorney general is scheduled to begin the closing argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that evening.

Another black?!
NY's babysitter sued a couple who fired him for the text of "racist"
New York's babysitter sued the couple for dismissal of discrimination after receiving the text that had been misdirected from the mother who complained that she was "another black."
The couple denied them racist, equating the incidence of the act as "correct."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother to two children, expressed her disappointment when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"TIDAKKKKKKKK is a HITAM BILLION," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the text.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, instead she had sent the message to Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman who felt "less comfortable" had fired Maurice, and said that the previous nanny, an African-American, did not perform well and he expected the presence of a nanny from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one working day and sent home with Uber.
Maurice now sued the couple for compensation for the dismissal, and demanded compensation in <0x24>350 a day for six months, reimbursement of the residence he had offered, without contract.
"I want to show them, see, you shouldn't," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple had responded to the allegations they were racist, saying the action of ending Maurice's service was natural because they felt the woman could not be trusted after offending the woman's notice.
"My wife sent me something that she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But are you going to put your child's care on someone you've done so badly, even if that's a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Not."
Taking the action as a "corruption", Plasco said his wife had just two months of giving birth and in "a difficult situation."
“You want to wear someone in such a situation?
"It's not a good thing," added the banker.
As the case took place, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them against their actions and logic.
Paddington publishers are concerned that readers are difficult to relate to speaking bear, a new letter reveals
Bond's son, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the condition of the person who read the book first before the book was published.
It's really exciting when we know about Paddington's success."
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before inspiring children's books, a little toy bear, felt optimistic about his work being rejected, the woman added, the 60th anniversary of the book's publication as a "sweet coat" after his father's death last year.
About Paddington, he described as "the most important member of our family," he added, his father was proud of his success in the end.
"Father of a silent man, he's not a person who likes to talk big," he said.
"But, because Paddington was too alive for him, as if you had a child who achieved something you were proud of, even if it wasn't what you made.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although the bear is his creation and imagination, he always credits Paddington himself."
My son is in Nazak and I have to say goodbye by phone.
After landing, the daughter is sent to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, Nice in a hurry where doctors have worked hard to save her life.
"Nad calls me often to say that the bad situation is bad and he won't be able to be saved," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he's going to die in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, baby.
You'll be by your side soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication given by the doctor to pump his heart slowly out and leave the system.
He died before his time, and this is all dead.
I just sit there and wait, knowing this will happen.
I can't cry or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold back."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in the midst of her grief for the loss of her son, boarded a plane with other passengers - who did not tell her about the bitter experience she experienced.
“No one knows,” he said.
"I bow down my head, and tears are swollen at all times.
It was hard to describe, but on this journey I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.”
A sad woman sends a postcard to avoid self-destruction on the bridge
Two women who lose a loved one who kills themselves, work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a letter on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers to contact for support.
Davis's 13-year-old son Tyler began to suffer depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any mom to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, aged 45, lived in Lydney, said his son was a potential cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him with a smile.
They always say that their smiles can turn into any room."
However, he stopped working before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old sister at the time, met her brother after her brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm worried about continuing if this will cause the effect of other things to happen."
Davis created a card, "to inform people that there's someone you can meet and talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit in silence - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
"He didn't tell me that he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't look at them or anything."
He said his partner's death was a big trauma to them, but they were forced to pass him: "He made a big hole in the family.
He made us split.
But we have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends as the FBI begins investigation
"I think, if we can get what he wants - a limited time investigation, a limited scope - we can lead to the unit," Flake said on Sunday, adding that the "kucar -kacir" committee in a standstill based on the belief that has roots in the wild.
Why did Kavanaugh and Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their aversion is due to the lack of adversity.
The mid-term elections are in just five more weeks, and on November 6 - if as expected, the Republican decision is not satisfactory, they will get weaker to get the person they want to appoint for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has made a call to Senators, lobbying them supporting Kavanaugh, who had worked at the White House for Bush and through Bush had found his wife Ashley, who was secretary to Bush.
What happens after the FBI provides a report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats convened.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which will allow Mike Pence, the deputy president, to equalise the series and confirm his position in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to the South Korean legislature.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - covering 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the high levels imposed by people smugglers are a major factor.
Pyongyang does not provide any public reviews.
Most North Korean defectors will be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Army Free Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants not as political refugees and often sends them back forcibly.
The relationship between the North and the South - technically still fighting - has improved since the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on the negotiating negotiation of nuclear power.
This comes after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a general sense to head towards nuclear-free on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. sanctions that slowed the development of negotiations since the event.
"Without any trust from the U.S., our country's security is not guaranteed and therefore, we will not begin nuclear disarmament first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh an "emotion," and was inappropriate for office in the Supreme Court
Minority Council chairman Nancy Pelosi called future Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "emotion" and said, her carrying was inappropriate to hold a post at Mahlamah Agong.
Pelosi made the following review in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe if a woman behaves like that, they will say the woman is 'emotional,'" Pelosi said of a reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both teenagers.
During the opening of his statement, Kavanaugh was emotional, sometimes almost screaming and crying while discussing family and while in high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "extremely and contamination of a well-designed name" managed by the still angry liberal Hilary Clinton was killed in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he was not eligible to hold a post in the Agong Court, as it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I feel he has eliminated his own eligibility and his actions against the Clinton and Democrat families," he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if he would try to claim Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- If he doesn't speak true to Congress and the FBI, he's not eligible to hold a post in the Agong Court, but only in the court he's currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision to the Possible Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was regarded as a conservative court.
In a confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering whether he would change the decision of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an emotional, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'a fun step,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to show it.
It was a reasonable nist word, an inflammatory that had been months and years in abundance, and he did not hold anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something amazing, do you agree?"
She relates, "I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said she also cried when angry, but had created a technique, if she felt angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
Then he continued.
And I think that's a wise suggestion."
Anger is a way of expressing anger because it is always misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of an old job, in a man-dominated office, I found me crying with an unwavering angry feeling, I was pulled by an older woman in the neck - a cold manager that I frantically - pulled me into the staircase.
"Don't show them your tears," he told me.
"They don't know what you're going through.
They think you're sad and will be happy to make you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, a former congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during her presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested holding a tough relationship in a boat called Monkey Business out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, was very disappointed, feeling there was no reason to stop him from joining the presidential campaign.
"It's not a carefully planned decision," he said laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are seven more contestants and they don't need another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to the event occurring at the end of the campaign, the woman missed out in an attempt to set up a tube, and she vowed not to contest as long as she did not earn <0x24>2 million.
It's a vain struggle.
He found his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to the man would give him only <0x24>250.
"Do they feel like I'm getting a discount?" he said.
When he says that he won't launch a formal campaign, he feels a variety of feelings - grateful to those who support him, disappointed by the system that makes it difficult to ask for donations and that targets non-candidate voters, and is angry about sexism - and he feels astute.
"You're going to think I'm going to have a soul break," Schroeder said about how the media reacted to him.
"You'll think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember when I thought about it, what would put it on my sandstone?
"She's crying?"
The U.S.-China trade war may benefit Beijing
The beginning of the trade war between the U.S. and China may be intimidating, and even though the fighting has not yet ended, a dispute between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts said.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, has issued its first warning earlier this year by charging taxes on Chinese exports including solar, iron and aluminum panels.
The most significant increase occurred this week with a new tariff that would affect the value of the item, such as taxing on half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing responded in the same way every time, most recently, it imposed tariffs of five to ten percent to over 60 billion American goods.
China has pledged to repay the U.S. every action, and the world's second-largest economy is not impressed.
To make Washington backwards means subject to U.S. will, but to bow to the U.S. it is said that many are too embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, President of China.
According to experts, if Beijing plays cards correctly, the pressure of the U.S. Trade War can positively support China in the long run by lowering the interstate interdependence between the two countries.
"A quick political decision by either Washington or Beijing could begin an uncontrolled economic situation in any country and appear to be more dangerous than the previous observers had experienced," said Abigail Grace, a research felony who focused Asia at the Center for New America's Safety, a group of thinkers.
Syria 'ready' to return political refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria said the country was ready for a return on the country's political displacement and applied for help to redevelop the country that was destroyed by a seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations Agong Summit, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made to combat terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore to normal conditions.
The situation is now ready for the return of the refugees, to the country they have to leave due to violence and unilateral economic measures that affect their daily life and search points.
The UN says more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to develop the ruined country.
But he said the country would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from the country supporting the uprising.
