Increased cumulative incidences of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incidents of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) show similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Areas and the United Kingdom confirm that, despite being at different levels depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly contagious in all countries.
Based on the experience from Italy, the country, hospitals and treatment units should increase their willingness to increase the number of patients with COVID-19 that will require health care, and in particular treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia from an unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause agent is a novel coronavirus that is now referred to as the acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Until now it has been proven that about 80<0x25> of individuals with COVID-19 have mild illness, cth. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients are cured.
In approximately 14<0x25> of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease that requires treatment in hospitals while the remaining 6<0x25> of cases experience critical diseases that require treatment.
The death of patients hospitalized from COVID-19 is about 4<0x25>.
In this study, we assessed trends in COVID-19 cumulative incidents in every country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) as well as comparing those countries with the Hubei Region, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Covid-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has undergone subsequent geographic transmission and the dynamics of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic at this time according to the country's dynamics.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spitri et al. reported on the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Europe according to WHO's definition of the case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 among those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), which between 31 December 2019 and including the date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases notified in every country around the world, is obtained from official sources only such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
The data is used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as compare that data with Italy.
As a proxy for the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the cumulative incidence of the 14-day COVID-19 case, thus taking into account the natural route of COVID-19, in every EU/EEA and UK countries, during the period of 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present the number of cumulative cases notified for each country on March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to the number of Italian cases for the period of 31 January-15 March 2020.
Covid-19 trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend in the 14-day cumulative incident of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK generally follows a trend in the Hubei Region (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, COVID-19 cumulative incidents began to rise around February 21 and then rose significantly around February 28, 2020 (additional material).
This is largely driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar increase trend for COVID-19 cumulative incidents (Additional ingredients).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in the EU/EEA and UK countries compared to cases in Italy for the period of 31 January-15 March 2020.
It stressed that, as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported the same number of cases as Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trend of COVID-19 cumulative incidents suggests that the pandemic is being infectious at the same speed in all countries.
Although countries are at different levels, diversity in national public health responses and case definitions may differ in countries as well as different protocols to choose patients who must be tested for COVID-19 verification, including follow-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected region of Italy described a situation that saw 10<0x25> of patients infected with COVID-19 requiring treatment and media sources reported that hospitals and treatment units in the region had already reached maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or treatment units are currently available at EU/EEA levels for cases of 6<0x25> and 1<0x25> only, respectively (not shown data).
However, the data should be collected in a systematic way to support current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a large variation in the availability of intermediate care and care beds in Europe, between 29.2 in Germany and 4.2 beds for every 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that the country has more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of care and intermediate care for every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
The modeling scenario related to the accuracy of health care capacity, with budgets for each EU/EEA and UK countries for the spread of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals attributed to <0x3E>90<0x25> risk exceeding the capacity of care care beds, provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 by the ECDC.
Since so far cases have formed clusters in certain servers in the EU/EEA and UK countries, as well as hospitals and treatment units typically control a clear area focus population, information about cases and treatment beds should be provided in Tatama for regional units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and treatment units should therefore be prepared for SARS-CoV-2 gradual community transmission scenarios and an increase in the number of COVID-19 infected patients that require health care, especially treatment, as is happening in the affected region of Italy.
As emphasized in the recent ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive and thorough approach is important to slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with a deterioration from the restriction approach to reduction, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers sufficient time to understand, accept and adjust their appropriate response if not implemented earlier.
Rapid risk assessment also lists general health care measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
There are short window opportunities that see countries have the possibility to continue to increase their control efforts to slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission and reduce stress on health care.
If this fails, it is likely that another EU/EEA state health care system will face an increase in patients requiring treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in calamity for humans.
Just like its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of humans in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be spread from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but is more susceptible to infection and affects more parents than teenagers and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of issues about the emerging disease, this article is trying to give a timely and thorough view of the rapidly growing research subject.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in understanding and eradicating the life-threatening disease.
The Flower Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory by Chinese people who are urged to sit at home throughout the holiday season and weeks after the outbreak of a novel disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 and related diseases called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients allowed to go home and more than 3,000 patients died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the number 1 public enemy" and potentially stronger than violence.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 2000 papers have been published on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since its first report on January 7, 2020 that determines the case of a virus isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in the new and rapidly growing subject areas.
When appropriate, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, triggered in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as a few more important questions.
CoV is traditionally considered a harmless pathogen to humans, usually the cause of approximately 15<0x25> of the common cold 4.
However, in this century, we have twice discovered high-patogen human CoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which led to the outbreak of their respective origins in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with severe mortality rates and deaths.
Covid-19 is the third CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, an unknown cluster of pneumonia originally reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the CoV was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan's first death was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spreads rapidly to cities, territories and neighbouring countries.
On January 20, infections among health care staff were reported, suggesting that human infections to humans could occur.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was charged with locking orders with all public transport services discontinued.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the starting place of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the disease a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Rajah 2).
Since the situation is growing rapidly, the final scope and severity of the disease is not yet certain.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients gave a more recent illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects patients of all ages, but most are aged 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7<0x25>) of infected patients are over 50 years of age, very few are under 20 years of age and only 14 individuals are infected under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
Covid-19 develops in clusters mostly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from beginning to diagnosis.
The average duration of the drilling period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from beginning to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95<0x25> CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted RO is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, corresponding to the period of massive movement before the Flower Festival in China.
The death rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 1.10-1.86<0x25>), and the death rate adjusted for all patients was 3.06<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 2.02-4.59<0x25>).
The three main factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) with severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily for a large and protected virus that contains a single sensory RNA thread.
The virus can be divided into four genomes, cth., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, between all alpha- and beta-CoV are known to infect humans.
Spike (S) surface glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for each SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then merge membranes apply.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the replication of the virus genus, the genome RNA is accompanied by surface glycoprotein and the protent of the nucleopapsid forms a vesicles containing virion, which then lists with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
SARS-CoV-2's first genome reference was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new beta-CoV type with more than 99.98<0x25> genetic identity in 10 referred samples taken from the origin of the disease, the Huanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transfer electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the thinnest parts of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 is found to be a recipient for SARS-CoV- 2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein for SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins that are encoded by orf3b and proteins encoded by orf8.
Orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in virus pathogens and have IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any functional domains or motives.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the cyro-EM structure for ACE2 humans was fully at2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in complex with B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed authentication, has been combined as dimer and ACE-BOAT2 complex can combine two S proteins, which provide evidence for the recognition and CoV infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug filtration to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and Mid-Hosting
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS Cov come from bats and are transferred to humans by means of mosquitoes and camels.
Through comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetics with other CoVs, bats are considered as hostesses of SARS-CoV-2 origin because the new virus is 96<0x25> similar to two CoVs such as SARS from bats called bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, the intermediate hose that helps the virus to cross the barriers of the species to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route is still unexplained.
Ji, et al., suggests snakes as carriers of viruses from bats to humans involving a recombination that is homologous in S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that mills - mammals long-sleeved ant eaters who have always been used in traditional Chinese medicine - are a potential yag intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99<0x25> genetic homology in CoV found in mills and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1<0x25> difference spread across the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, the final decision to present concrete evidence is being awaited (Fig.33).
The physiological properties of SRAS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 45 days below 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40<0x25>-50<0x25> humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heat rays at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75<0x25> ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peretic acid, chlorophom, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively disable the virus.
The entire human population generally has no immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore considered easy to attack by virus novels.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported in regards to the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Race 4).
Generally, after the virus invades the host, the virus is first identified by the host's natural immune system through pattern identification receptors (PRRs) including receptors such as C type lectin, Tol (TLR) receptors, NOD receptors (NLRs), and receptors such as RIG-I (RLR).
Despite the different pathways, the virus results in an expression of inflammatory factors, the maturity of dendritic cells and the cystic interferon type I (IFNs) that limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the fagocytosis of antigen virus.
However, N SARS-CoV protein can help the virus avoid immune response.
Shortly thereafter, the immune response was also against the virus.
T lymphocytes include CD4<0x2B> T cells and CD8<0x2B> play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells continue to kill virus-infected cells.
The helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by resulting in T cell apoptosis.
Humoral nutrients include complements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from patients who have healed neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals in the body that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, as well as, in the worst scenario, failure of several organs, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, based on early clusters, are more likely to affect gold citizens with comorbidities and pregnant women.
Being common for those exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is affected, they have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The average drying period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the duration of the immersion was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as stated above, shows that the duration of the immersion is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust effective quarantine times based on the most accurate period of drying, while preventing those infected but not having symptoms from spreading the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals who are exposed to, or infected by, viruses usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually a major and early symptom for COVID-19, which can be accompanied without symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rinorea, chest pain, diarrhea, diarrhea, fatigue and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's condition immediately increases to acute respiratory syndrome, septic cramps, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms and fever, even without the abnormalities of pulmonary imaging, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98<0x25> for fever, 76<0x25> for dry cough, 55<0x25> for dyspnea, and 3<0x25> for diarrhea; 8<0x25> of patients needed respiratory help.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of family clusters and clusters resulting from the spread of asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98<0x25>), dry cough (47<0x25>), and dyspnea (55<0x25>) as their main symptoms.
However, 80<0x25> of them require respiratory assistance, far more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher constipation by MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26<0x25>) and throat pain (21<0x25>) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99<0x25>-100<0x25>), dry cough (29<0x25>-75<0x25>), dyspnea (40<0x25>-42<0x25>), diarrhea (20-25<0x25>), and throat pain (13-25<0x25>) are major symptoms and respiratory relief has been required for approximately 14<0x25>-20<0x25> of patients.
As of February 14, the death toll from COVID-19 was 2<0x25> when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS until November 2002 was 10<0x25> of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the death rate was 37<0x25> of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Early studies reported that R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with 95<0x25> confidence (CI) 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, death rates and RO of the disease is shown in Table 1.
The number above suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to be contagious than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less fatal than the two diseases.
Therefore, it is much more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Cluster startups often occur in the same family or from the same assembly or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of traveling or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the last two weeks before starting to get sick.
However, it has been reported that patients can carry the virus without symptoms longer than two weeks and patients who have been cured who are allowed to return home from the hospital can carry the virus again, which sends a warning to increase quarantine time.
The patient has a normal amount of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) or decreases at an early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L includes a count of lymphocytes <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and increased levels of aminotransferase aspartate and viremi have been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin have increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive proteins as well as erythrocytes sedimentation have increased in most patients' blood.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels, fibrin degradation products present in the blood, have increased, and the count of lymphocytes has decreased significantly.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are shown by bilateral-focused shadows or soil glass impairment in the lungs.
Patients usually experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, rapid fluid accumulation and fibrosis adversely affect gas exchange.
Type-I and type-II pneumocytic dysfunction reduces the surfactant stage and increases surface tension, while also reducing the lung ability to expand and increase the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the discovery of poor chest radiography is usually in line with the worst stage of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocytes descuamation, the formation of hialin membranes and interstitial lymphocytic ingestion as well as multinucleate lungs in patients dying from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS as well as similar to the pathology of SARS and MERS patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through a transcription-reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, as a result of high false negative rates, which may be causing epidemics, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurs with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological discoveries is important as well as imperative to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group described the protol of using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects the SARS-CoV-2 synthesized RNA fragments at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using less time-depensile stems.
Hopefully the new technique can significantly increase sensitivity and ease if confirmed in clinical samples.
As a result of a lack of experience with the novel CoV, doctors can generally provide support treatments to COVID-19 patients, while attempting various therapies that have been used or proposed before for other CoV treatments such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as other viral diseases (Table2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who have recovered is also recommended for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies dolphin to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 usually attacks the lungs at the initial stage and may also attack, at a lower level, other organs that produce ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to the patient and are the leading cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is important to relieve symptoms and save lives as well as including oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to be supported by the oxygenation of the extracorporeum membrane (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary grafting technique used for the treatment of cardium failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the retention of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections as well as sepsis shock, and the protection of important organ functioning is also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storms result from excessive responses to the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of cytokine series including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
This cytokine triggers immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals that are the main causes of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunotyping is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immune response treatments for cytokine storms include modulation of T-cell-directed immune responses; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF restrictions; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibition.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in treating SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not beneficial for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids at high doses can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonectrosis, significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for a short period of time have been recommended to be used cautiously for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this article, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous use with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective against an American patient infected with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for treatment for diseases caused by the Ebola virus and Marlburg.
Later, remdesivir also showed the possibility of another single-breathing RNA virus inhibition including MERS and SARS viruses.
According to this observation, Gilead has given the mix to China to conduct a pair of trials against individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, melanavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, ginger, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects can occur after combined therapy with spontaneity/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other drugs used to the patient should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients who have recovered and antibody generation
Blood collection of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who have the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from being infected with the disease has a long history.
True, patients who have recovered usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight against pathogens and other foreign objects, and they identify unique molecules in the pathogen and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma has been collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and have been injected into 10 patients who are in serious condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced viral inflammation and load as well as increased accuracy in the blood.
However, confirmations and explanations are needed to suggest such methods for large-scale use before a specific therapy that has not yet been developed.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some of the adverse effects associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overly stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma is great for treating critical patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce antibodies that are specialized quickly to fight the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to separate B cells from patients who have recovered and to identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or filter effective antibodies against important viral proteins.
This way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends heavily on the combination of various components in different formulas according to the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components remain unknown or blurred as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimum combinations.
At present, due to a special and effective lack of therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe levels.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and Lian Hua <0x51>ing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rate of recovery in the treatment of COVID-19 patients has been seen in some regions in China that use TCM in 87<0x25> of their patients, including Gansu (63.7<0x25>), Ningxia (50<0x25>) and Hunan (50<0x25>), while Hubei region, which uses TCM in just about 30<0x25> of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest healing rate (13<0x25>).
However, this is a rather rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patient should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study to compare western medicine treatment (WM) alone with a combination of WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, loss of symptoms and treatment in hospitals was shorter in WM<0x2B>TCM groups than WM groups alone.
Amazingly, the rate for symptomatic conditions became even worse (from mild to severe) significantly lower for WM<0x2B>TCM groups than WM groups alone (7.4<0x25> versus 46.2<0x25>) and lower mortality rates in WM<0x2B>TCM groups than WM groups alone (8.8<0x25> versus 39<0x25>).
However, TCM's effectiveness and safety are still waiting for more controlled trials at greater levels and in more centres.
It must also be interesting to describe the mechanism of action and explain the effective components in TCM treatment or combination of those treatments if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are mostly experiencing great fear of highly infectious diseases and can cause death, while those who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia and cough as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to higher anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, various psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor addiction, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and suicide were reported.
The detection of mandatory and quarantine contacts, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause people to feel more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be given to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and people associated with them as well as the public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with fixed and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are important for disrupting the transfer chain from infected animal and human areas to exposed hosts and usually complement antiviral treatments in epidemic control caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been undertaken by developing an S-protein-based vaccine to generate long-term and effective neutral antibodies and/or nutrients that protect against SARS-CoV.
Directly weakening vaccines have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of the in vivo vaccine candidates in older individuals and their dangerous challenge models as well as their protection against zoonotic viral infections should be determined before clinical studies begin.
This is probably because SARS has ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions as a result of continuous zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
The vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS using unactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some have been tested in animal models.
The development of safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for immunized individuals is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty as a long period of time (approximately 18 months) is needed for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently shown a full clinical path in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can heal slowly without re-infection.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high mortality rates and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is important for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas that lack resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table33):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which is also true for COVID-19.
Covid-19 usually occurs in the age of 30-65 with 47.7<0x25> of patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 of the above-mentioned cases.
Patients who need treatment are more likely to have hidden comorbidities and complications and are much older than those who do not need them (at the age of 66 compared to 51), suggest age as a prognosis factor for the results of COVID-19 patients.
Women: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as stated above.
Comorbidity and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require treatment are more likely to experience acute cardium and arrhythmia injuries.
Cardium problems are also the cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be bound to ACE2 positive colangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that the hidden age and disease are interconnected and can interfere with each other.
abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been suggested as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to late therapy and healing.
Connecting CRP levels to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanina aminotransferase (ALT), and increased creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict results.
These enzymes are exacerbated in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are removed during tissue damage.
Therefore, it becomes a traditional marker for heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest radiography and progression of clinical symptoms over time should be considered together with other issues to predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunotinotandas commonly used as end-to-end therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Looking at the high dosage of corticosteroids has been widely used in severe SARS patients, many former patients suffer from avascular osteonectrosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As noted above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients have suffered from tremendous pressure as they often face long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the death of close family members and patient friends.
It is important to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far in, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to multiples in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be doubled efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the initial phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early phases or periods of immersion can produce a large number of viruses while performing daily activities, causing it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur during severe illness patients, while most transmissions do not occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much worse and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are being carried out in China, including the detention order in Wuhan and the surrounding city as well as the quarantine continues almost the entire population in the hope of deciding the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Despite the significant damage to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, signaling an epidemiological slowdown.
The most optimistic budget is that the outbreak will end at the end of March and the decline phase will run for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be much more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., made a model for predicting the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in both the central turbinate swab and the patient's recovered throat and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could be a recurring episode such as influenza.
However, convincing signals have occurred in China based on the growing number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may be effective.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, with quarantine and rigorous isolation, the disease was finally managed.
Therefore, just like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become weaker and eventually end up or become less pathogenic viruses that exist together with humans.
Comparisons between the COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS are provided below (Rajah (Rajah 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to contract through coughing or sneezing, and can also infect through direct contact with the material that the virus has contaminated.
The virus is also found in feces, causing a new possibility of transmission from feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41<0x25> of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health officials.
Therefore, careful precautions should be used to protect people, especially health workers, social workers, family members, friends, even people on the side of the road relating to the patient or the infected person.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of the eyebrows is by wearing face masks; both the use of a surgical mask and N95 respiratory mask (syri <0x23> 1860) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgery facial masks prevent fluid drops from individuals who are likely to be infected from being spread through ventilation or attached to the surface of the material, which can be further spread to others.
However, only N95-type masks (series <0x23>1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5<0x25> virion that can penetrate N95-type masks; SARS-CoV-2 is almost the same size as SARS-CoV in terms of size where both are approximately 85 nm.
Given that viral particles can penetrate five surgical face masks used together, health workers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series <0x23>1860s) instead of surgical face masks.
In addition to face masks, health officials need to wear self-protection equipment to reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect individuals through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing N95 face masks; the virus may have entered his body through an inflammatory eye.
In this regard, health officials also need to wear a face covering or safety glasses when dealing with the patient.
For the public in the affected or potentially affected area, it is advised that all residents wash their hands with disinfective soap regularly, stay at home and reduce contact with people who are likely to be infected.
A three-foot distance is considered an appropriate distance to stay away from the patient.
These measures are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection in addition to preventing transmission of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 alerted China as the SARS outbreak struck in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020 Wuhan's director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is trying to reduce the concern of its citizens by saying that the novel virus has low infection rates and limited reproduction in humans as well as prevention and prevention of disease is not a problem.
The message eases the public's concern, especially when the rest of the country is preparing for the Autumn Festival, and it is not welcome to curb the outbreak on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
China's disease control agency can take advantage of this issue and make improvements in the future.
For example, the appropriate agency (1) is more careful in making public announcements as each detail conveyed affects the attitudes and decisions of the people; (2) is more sensitive and reactive to the extraordinary information received from the clinic than to wait for formal reports from the doctor or officer; (3) is more assertive in precipitating the disease rather than instilling the public; and (4) the exercise is more frequent.
Covid-19 transmission is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 novel virus that began in late December 2019.
Within less than 2 months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 countries around the world when this writing was made.
Since the virus is almost the same as SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also almost the same as SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created the sentiment that the SARS outbreak has repeated.
However, there is a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is important in stemming the epidemic and treating patients.
Covid-19 has an effect on individuals aged than young people and has more impact on men than women, severity and mortality rates are also higher for older citizens than youths.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91<0x25> compared to 1.44<0x25>).
COVID-19 patients can spread the virus without any symptoms while SARS patients spread the virus in a state of illness, resulting in difficulty in stemming the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains the cause of SARS-CoV-2 is spread faster and broader than SARS-CoV.
The results of the RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for COVID-19 patients.
However, patients who have been cured can be found positive for the virus again.
These findings indirectly increase the risk of viral transmission.
Based on the rapid progress in the study of COVID-19, some critical issues still need to be addressed, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
While 96<0x25> of genetic homologs are found in SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs such as SARS bats, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 also comes from bats.
What are animals that become an intermediary species that spread the virus from homeowners, for example bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and 2, we can't decide the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can repeat at any time.
Although molecular and biochemical model tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2, how can viruses actually enter airway cells and so on result in pathological changes?
Does the virus bind ACE2 expression cells to other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis as well as effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically through transmission among humans?
Will it be a worldwide pandemic, erased like SARS or repeated periodically like a flu?
This is important, but it will take time to find answers to the questions above and a variety of other questions.
However, no matter the expenses to be demanded, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as quickly as possible and restore our lives to normal.
The origins of human coronavirus zoonotic
Mutations and adaptations have encouraged the joint evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its main hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) had been known to cause mild diseases, such as flu.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed their views and revealed how HCoV is a life-threatening and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China at the end of 2019 has attracted attention to CoV and surprises us with its easy but less pathogenic abilities than SARS-CoV.
HCoV infections are zoonosis and understanding of the origin of the HCoV zoonotic origin can help us.
Most HCoVs come from non pathogenic bats.
An intermediary reservoir for some HCoV is also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The investigation into the interaction of CoV hosts in animals allows the philosophical importance of CoV pathogenesis in humans to be obtained.
In this study, we presented an overview of existing knowledge related to the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of its discovery as well as the origin of zoonotic and transmission between species.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate HCoV differences from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The epidemic disease during COVID-19 is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for successful hospice exchange as well as the implications for the evolution of the virus to the severity of the disease has also been confirmed.
Coronavirus (CoV) is a family of Coronaviridae, consisting of a single group of RNA viruses, positively chanted, veiled.
The genome's length is between 26 and 32 kilobases and is the largest genome among the RNA viruses and is named "CoV" because of its morphological form that looks like a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of structure, CoV has non-segmented genomes that share the same structure.
It is estimated that two-thirds of these genomes have two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) intertwined, which are later translated to pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replicate.
Polyprotein is then processed to produce 16 non-structured proteins, known as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remaining genome consists of ORFs for structured proteins, including papaku (S), cover (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some protein accessory special customers are also encoded according to different customers of CoV.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoV is classified into four genera (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-CoV genera consists of most HCoVs and is divided into four sequences (A, B, C and D).
phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and mice act as gene sources to most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoirs for gamma-CoV and delta-coV.
For thousands of years, CoV has crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as an important human pathogen.
So far, 7 human coronaviruses (HCoV) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which are alpha-CoV.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 typically result in simple symptoms, such as flu and/or diarrhea.
Instead, the newly identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, resulting in severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients with high probability of developing acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, had been isolated from the nasal discaj of patients suffering from flu in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both resulting in self-control symptoms.
This concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is harmless until the SARS outbreak appears.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 and is one of the worst destructions in history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a roughly 10<0x25> death rate.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spreads around the world.
The 2019 HCoV novel (2019-nCoV), later named as SARS-CoV-2, is an agent of the ongoing epidemic of the 2010 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-1), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 individuals as of March 3, 2020.
Warnings have been given and the world needs to be prepared to face the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, rats and domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the origins of the evolution of all HCovs from bats, where the virus is easy to adapt and not pathogenic but shows great genetic diversity.
The COVID-2019 epidemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the rest of the world.
The detection of HCoV zoonotic origins provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving power and restriction factors for species leaps.
It may also drive and facilitate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and staging host for SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for future abundance prevention.
In this review we presented an overview of zoonotic origins, transmissions between species and pathogenesis for HCoV.
In particular, we outline and discuss the common theme in which HCoV virion is non pathogenic within the natural reservoir of the host but becomes pathogenic after the transmission of interspecies to the new host.
We also reviewed the direction of the flow of HCoV evolution where increased transmissions often appear with pathogenic reductions.
The results of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the influenza patient's nasal scalp, different CoVs have been isolated in a variety of infected animals, including Dutch chickens, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV's discovery in chronological rules (Table 1) can provide information and teaching.
The first HCoV-229E strain had been isolated from the patient's respiratory tract causing germ infections in the upper respiratory tract in 1966, and so on has been adapted to grow inside the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E are seen with flu symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, lethargy and throat pain, with fever and cough seen in 10<0x7E>20<0x25> of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequently serialized citations within the brain of breastfeeding rats.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection is seen to be similar to the infection by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from infections with other respiratory tract pathogens such as the influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread all over the world and tend to be more contagious during winters in moderate temperate areas.
Usually, the duration of the drying of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by the disease for about 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild regular flu.
Only a few patients have been compromised to show severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, is a pandemic caused by the first well-recorded HCoV in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV found.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread in many countries and continents.
In addition to super spreaders, it is estimated that each case can cause approximately two secondary cases, with a duration of immersion between 4 and 7 days and a viral-free peak appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed mialgia, headaches, fever, fever and cold, followed by dyspnea, coughing and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphofenia, an elevated liver function test and increased creatine kinase is the normal laboratory abnormality of SARS.
Alveolar diffuse damage, the development of epithelium cells and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30<0x25> of patients then require medical treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to infections in the lower respiratory tract, a variety of organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected in this severe case, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can cause fatalities especially in immunocompromising patients.
The virus was first isolated from a brother's open lung biopsy to index patients traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, many efforts have been undertaken for HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was expelled from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially found to be widespread among children, goldsmiths and insurgent patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of choriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another free study describes the same virus isolation from the nasal specimen of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause for approximately 4.7<0x25> of regular respiratory diseases and the peak time for the disease to occur is during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as a rupe.
That same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis infected in the community, HCoV-HKU1 is also reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Just like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 are found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four infected HCoVs in the community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and then cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents do occur for unknown causes because there are rare cases about the younger HCoV-NL63 subtype, which has recently been reported to have caused severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Generally speaking, when this HCoV acquires the ability to spread efficiently and to remain continuously in the human body, the virus also becomes less susceptible or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most cases confirmed by the laboratory are from the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary transmission to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations for MERS match SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also suffer from acute kidney failure, which has so far been unique to MERS among diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30<0x25> of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported with a high case death of 34.4<0x25>, making MERS-CoV one of the most severe viruses that hit humans.
During the mid to late December 2019, a retrospectively known cluster of pneumonia patients related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared an outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections occurring due to SARS-CoV-2 as a Public Health Emergency at the International Stage and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been reported worldwide, with a gross case death of 3.4<0x25>.
In fact, the death toll in Hubei, China is 4.2<0x25>, while the case deaths outside the area are 1.2<0x25>.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea also occurs in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can increase rapidly to become an acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of the high nucleotide reference homology of 82<0x25>, the virus is grouped into different leaves on phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but is more susceptible to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to proper transmission worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals a very interesting equation and differences.
First, the timing and duration of the occurrence of HCoV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four HCoVs found from the community (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
In one sense, SARS-CoV-2 infections show features that are more commonly seen during HCoV infections found from the community, including the presence of unspecific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is low.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows attractive pattern features for both HCoVs found from the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infertility is at least as high as HCoV found from the community.
On the other hand, it is difficult to verify whether SARS-CoV-2's infertility decreases after passing through humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, just like any other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in feces samples.
Whether oral stool transfers for SARS-CoV-2 play an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under certain circumstances awaiting enlightenment through future studies.
It's also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may be triggered according to the season as in the case of HCoV infected in the community.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 feature includes persistent infertility, pathogenicity and spread after humans will affect the final fate of the COVID-19 outbreak.
All four HCoVs infected in the community cause mild symptoms to be well adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans who have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the HCoV pandemic.
HCoV that causes severe disease in humans and humans who have severe HCoV disease has been removed.
In order to allow this to happen, HCoV needs to double in humans up to sufficient levels to allow the collection of adaptive mutations that fight the hose restriction factor.
Therefore, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak survives and the more people infected, the greater the chance for the virus to adapt fully to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to prevent with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four CoVs infected in the community circulated in the human population, triggering a common cold in the topic of turbulent compromise.
The virus does not require animal reservoirs.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and the transmission of the virus in humans cannot be maintained.
The virus needs to stay and breed in its zoonotic reservoir as well as find opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate hoses and breeders.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same features as both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoV infected in the community.
It is very easily contagious as HCoV is infected in the community, at least at this time.
However, the virus is more pathogenic than HCoV infected in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
The time will determine whether the virus will completely adapt to humans and spread among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the origins of animals that are the cause of HCoV, it is best to discuss the definition and features of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediary and reproductive HCoV.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoV if it has a very close heir that shares high homology at the nucleotide level.
The hereditary virus usually adapts well and is not pathogenic in this hose.
Likewise, the reservoir host stores HCoV continuously and for the long term.
In both cases, hoses are usually naturally infected and are natural hoses for HCoV or its virion.
Conversely, if new HCoV is introduced to an intermediate host before or around its introduction to humans, the virus does not adapt well to a new and usually pathogenic host.
This intermediate hose can act as a zoonotic source for human infections and play a role as a reproductive host by allowing the virus to multiply temporarily and then spread the virus to humans to strengthen the scale of human infections.
HCoV can have a dead road infection if it is unable to maintain its viability in the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and also create a sixth-term adequacy.
In this case, intermediate hosts become natural reservoir hosts.
Epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that the case of the SARS index has a history of contact with animals.
Subsequent seroprevalens investigations showed that animal sellers had higher anti SARS-CoV IgG prevalents than the general public.
Musang lampi (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market were first identified carrying viruses such as SARS-CoV that are almost similar to SARS-CoV.
This is supported indirectly with the fact that no SARS has been reported again after killing all mosquitoes on the market.
However, it has been reported that lantern mosquitoes from forests or farms without exposure to the live animal market are mostly negative SARS-CoV, suggesting that lamri mosquitoes may only be hoses strengthening intermediaries but not natural SARS-CoV reservoirs.
Most notably, as 80<0x25> of different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti SARS-CoV antibodies, it is likely that a variety of small mammal species may also be a host of strengthening intermediaries for SARS-CoV should not be left out.
All of this seems to be a dead road hose for SARS-CoV.
The next search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV revealed the closely related CoV of bats, called CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) Rhinolophus bats associated with SARS, which exists in China's almonds.
This bat is positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome reference of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These bats and other CoV bats share 88-92<0x25> nucleotide conferencing homology with SARS-CoV.
The study has provided the basis for the new concept that bat hoarse produces human pathogens.
Some CoVs such as SARS (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none but one named WIV1 can be isolated as living viruses.
Human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is known as a receiver for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from a sample of bat stools is shown to use bats, mosquitoes and human ACE2 as a receiver for cell entry.
More interestingly, patients with SARS are found to be able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related offspring for SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95<0x25> of nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus for SARS-CoV and a bat is not a SARS-CoV live reservoir host.
phylogenetic analysis puts MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV bats use the same hose receptors, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The RNA polymerase reference depends on the RNA of MERS-CoV is phylogeneticly closer to the virus in the beta-CoV of known bats from Europe and Africa.
So far, no MERS-CoV life can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and CoV-HKU25's closest family share only 87<0x25> of nucleotide homology.
Therefore, the bat may not be a reservoir host directly to MERS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, show that Arab camels have a positive effect on MERS-CoV special neutrality antibodies, just like camels in the Middle East that come from various African countries.
MERS-CoV living similar to the virus found in humans has been isolated through the nasal swab of arab camel, in turn showing that the camel serves as a genuine MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It should also be noted that generally simple symptoms but large decay of the virus has been observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
In particular, infected camels release viruses not only through the respiratory path but also through the stool-mouth path, which is also a path for viruses to be released from bats.
However, the question remains since many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before symptoms begin, possibly associated with human-to-human dissemination pathways or unknown dissemination pathways involving unknown animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2<0x25> of homologous nucleotides with CoV RatG13 bats isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
In the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the deviation of referrals between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too large to determine parental relationships.
In other words, bats may not be the closest reservoir host to SARS-CoV-2 but a nearly similar bat CoV found in the future.
Perhaps, the intermediate animal host to SARS-CoV-2 is of a wild species sold and killed in the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market, which is associated with many early COVID-19 cases, indicating possible animal spread events to humans.
Several recent studies based on the metagenomics sequence have suggested that a group of threatened small mammals known as mills (Manis javanica) may also store beta-CoV descendants associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This milling CoV genome shares 85-92<0x25> nucleotide conferencing homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with approximately 90<0x25> identity at the nucleotide level.
They were assembled in two subgenres of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in a philogenetic tree, one of which shared a more similar receptor binding domain (RDB) to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4<0x25> amino acid reference identities.
In real differences, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are more deviant, although it has a higher degree of homology-wide pronunciation of the genome.
Previous studies of infected mills also reported detection of viral contigits from lung samples, which were later found to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a collection method and selected a manual stack to generate a partial genome reference that covers approximately 86.3<0x25> of the full virus genome.
We cannot underestimate the possibility that the mill is one of the intermediate animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, at this time there is no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 directly from the mill due to the deflection of SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated with SARS-COV-2 grinding.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated with SARS-COV-2 milling.
SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathways in bats, mills and other mammals still need to be set.
While the highest homology sequence has been found in the RBD between SARS-COV-2 and mill, beta-CoV is associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG12, which share the highest genome-wide homology.
Strong speculation states that the high level equation between RBD from beta-CoV related SARS-CoV-2 grinders and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by a focused evolution of choice.
A backup proposal favoured the recombination between the related beta-CoV SARS-CoV-2 mill and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary drive power, recaptures occur widely in beta-CoV.
Studies are still conducted on the origin of direct zoonotic SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, HCoV-229E zoonotic origins, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
phylogenetic evidence shows both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated in CoV bats, while virion HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 have been found in rats.
It has been reported that the ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) bats detected in North American three-color bats show close ties with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/Ghana Kwam/19/2008, which has been detected in Ghana, while camelid has also been suspected as an intermediary host.
To be clear, current knowledge of the animal origins of HCoV is known to be formulated in Figure 1 and Table 2.
phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for HCoV transmission events between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, the pandemic of respiratory infections was noted.
The history of HCoV-229E transmission between species is vague.
But the alpha-CoV of bats closely related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among them is alpha-CoV alpaka.
Some lines of evidence support the transmission of viruses from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpaka may have contact with bats in shared ecological niches.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the alpaca.
Secondly, bat alpha-CoV associated with HCoV-229E is diverse and non pathogenic in the bat, while alfa-CoV alpaka triggers respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaka is not found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is likely not to be excluded that alpaka gets an alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah and Hendra virus.
Therefore it is not so surprising that the bats can transfer HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, although alpha-CoV bats become powdered HCoV-229E genes, alpacas and arab camels may be intermediate hoses that transfer the virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is the best example of the transmission of species from bats to arab camels and from arab camels to humans.
The original evolution of MERS-CoV from bats is known at the beginning of the introduction and has been reinforced with subsequent inventions.
It is clear that bats provide the dust of virus species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and the transmission between species.
Long-lived, dense colonies, close social interactions and strong flying capabilities are all encouraging conditions for bats to become the ideal 'viral spreader'.
In addition, MERS-CoV has been introduced to Arabic camels for decades.
It adapts well to these camels who have switched from intermediate hoses to stable and natural reservoir hoses.
MERS-CoV causes very mild diseases and maintains relatively low mutation rates in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is accidental and humans remain the final host to MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be maintained.
In contrast to the camel function in MERS-CoV deployment, the milling function, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, beta-CoV milling is highly pathogenic in milling.
They may be the final host for the beta-CoV related SARS-CoV-2, the same as the mosquito in the case of SARS-CoV.
Some possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species from animals to humans should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can be a reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological niche with bats through a suction or coal mining.
Second, the mill can be one of the intermediate amplifier hoses that are recently recognized by SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans are infected with viruses through slaughtering and eating wild animals.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is necessary.
Third, as stated above, a recombination and SARS-CoV-2 adaptation may have occurred in a third species that has contacts with both bats and mills.
The search for animal origins for SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of hospice animals, the three main factors on the part of the virus are also important in making it easier for CoV to pass through species barriers.
First, their relative mutation rate is high in RNA multiplication.
Compared to single-sided RNA viruses, the estimated CoV mutation rate can be considered "simply" to "high" with an average exchange rate of <0x7E>10-4 exchanges per 2 sites, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to the novel host.
CoV has a pruf reading exoribonucleas, its blackout causes very high flexibility and weakness or maybe even a lack of living power.
Interestingly, the Remdesivir nucleotide analogue is known to suppress CoV multiplication through these exoribonuclease inhibitions and RNA-dependent polymerases.
Remdesivir is one of the best anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than its host.
In addition, mutation rates are often high when CoV doesn't adapt well to the hose.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate on SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low, suggesting a high level of adaptation to humans.
Perhaps, he has also adapted to other hosts close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which adapts well to arab camel.
In theory, it is not possible that genetic impairment will make the vaccine and antivirus against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in a short period of time.
Second, the largest RNA genome in CoV uses additional sterilization in genome changes for mutations and recombinations, while increasing the probability of shared evolution between species, which is beneficial for the appearance of CoV novels when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions that are encoded towards the end of the 3' genome.
Third, CoV exchanges templates randomly and often during RNA multiplication through unique "selective" mechanisms.
In hoses that serve as a mixture container, the exchange of threads occurs frequently during the transcription of RNA CoV.
The highly homologous subgenomous and full RNA can be rejoined to produce a new CoV.
Natural merger phylogenetic evidence has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as CoV animals such as SL-CoV and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus host interactions are related to transmission.
In addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another major factor that affects the transmission between species.
Here, the merger of SARS-CoV is taken as a special example, which also shows evidence of positive choice during inter-species transmission events.
Based on a comparison analysis between human digestion and SARS-CoV moisturizers, SARS-CoV is thought to be undergoing rapid adaptations in different hosts, especially with mutations in RBD on S proteins.
Generally, RBD on S proteins on CoV interacts with cells and is strongly chosen by the antibody response of the hose.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in 318 to 510 amino acids on S1 fragments, which bind to human ACE2 as well as a joint receptor for viral entry.
RBD from SARS-CoV is capable of identifying ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including bats, mosquitoes, rats and raccoons, allowing the spread of viruses between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues are observed as distinct from human and moisturizing viruses in RBD and 4 of them are located within the receptor binding motif for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV moisturizers have mutations of K479N and S487T on their RBD, which may increase the interaction of random proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, both amino acid exchanges may be important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same receptor cells as SARS-CoV.
30<0x25> of the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 units of S proteins have been altered that the bonding of these S proteins with human ACE2s may have been altered.
Of course, cryo-EM research shows that this bonding is 10 to 20 times higher than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also interesting to determine if any other joint receptors may be necessary for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
More interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with different S parts.
There are many other HCoV receptors that exist, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
It may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after the transmission between species from its animal host.
In addition to cellular receivers, the result of transmission between HCoV species also depends on the host dependence and other barrier factors.
The difference between human and HCoV natural reservoir hoses such as bats, arab camels and rodens may create a barrier to the transmission between species.
HCoV needs to capture hose dependency factors and subversion hose restriction factors for the transmission between successful species.
In this case, the molecular determination in the important areas of the interaction of these viruses is still unknown and characterized.
The filters around the unbiased genome for host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may yield results.
The Return of HCoV: Back to the Beginning
The diversity of CoV bats provides a broad opportunity for the appearance of the novel HCoV.
In this respect, CoV bats act as a pool of HCoV genes.
In addition, fast and genetic recombinant mutations also spur the evolution of HCoV and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein encoding genes has the potential to drastically modify virus phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV's accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adapting to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated but found to encode the repetitive ORF8 protein.
The nucleotide-29 SARS-CoV blackout feature has been found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This blackout separates the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adjustment mutation that promotes the exchange of hoses.
In addition, SARS-CoV has the possibility of a recombination history with the descendants of CoV alpha and gamma, which a large number of smaller recombinant areas have been identified in RNA-dependent polymerases.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10 and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to have a reunited occurrence between different breeds, which occur in arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, which saw HCoV rejoining with other animals in its non-structural genes.
Warnings should also be given that false selection can contribute to unintentional changes in the virus genome, which is most likely to result from freeing the virus from the pressure of the election imposed, such as the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype beam, due to the blackout of two nucleotides.
During the strong ORF4 can be seen in the bat virus and camels associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaka displays the insertion of single nucleotides, which results in skeletal spacing.
Finally, the evolution of the novel HCoV was also spurred by election pressure in their reservoir hoses.
Asymptomatic or mild symptoms alone have been detected when bats are infected with CoV, signaling a joint adjustment between CoV and bats.
It seems that the bat adapts well to CoV anatomically and psychologically.
For example, damage in the activation of pro-inflammatory responses in bats efficiently reduces pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in the bats is curtailed as a result of increased regulation of NKG2/CD94's natural killer cell receptors and a low level of expression for the first class molecule of the main histocene compatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high-metabolic activity of bats can both withstand CoV multiplication and affect the reading of pruf by exoribonuclease, while also providing election pressure for highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced to new hosts.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to novel protein acquisition or protein features for hose adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence when three HCoV novels have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hoses such as bats and camels.
It doubles quickly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret cause of asymptomatic carriers is seen and the cause for severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mostly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine storms in which the stronger the immune response, the worse the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been deactivated from CoV multiplication.
The same strategy that disabling the immune response may have a beneficial effect on anti-SaRS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is very strong in bats.
Therefore, the delivery of type 1 interferon at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of inflammation in bats is ineffective.
For this reason, NLRP3's inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although beta-CoV bats that share 95<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also CoV bats that share 96<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although mosquitoes and other animals on the market have been found to have viruses similar to SARS-CoV, a direct intermediary host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
A very homologous beta-CoV mill with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, indicating that a mill may be one of the intermediate hoses or beta-CoV grinding can donate gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by humans intentionally or inadvertently.
CoV has returned to focus as a result of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies of CoV in bats and other animals have drastically changed our views on the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoV in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have origins from bats and are transferred to humans through intermediary hoses.
Since SARS-CoV infections stem from contact between humans with mosquitoes in the market, closing the wet market and killing the wetlands should be able to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, mills should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, due to the discovery of multiple beta-CoV milling descendants closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the weather and the way SARS-CoV-2 is transferred to humans through mills and other mammals need to be explained in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in Arabic camels for a long time.
It has become an important tool for transportation as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local community.
It is found throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as recognized in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent the redistribution of the MERS outbreak, a thorough approach must be taken to develop an effective vaccine to oppose MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot get rid of this virus, new genotypes may appear to cause an outbreak.
Various CoV zoonotics are scattered in the woods.
In particular, CoV bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are many opportunities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and rejoin, causing the emergence of new CoVs that are more susceptible and/or can kill in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China must be stopped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response plans should be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet a long time ago.
The virus remained in a natural reservoir until there was an opportunity to infect.
Although bats have many features that make it easier to spread the virus, human chances of having contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if society is educated to stay away from the animal.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans as well as future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is by humans to avoid natural ecological nic reservoirs for zoonotic viruses.
Some of the questions about the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic are still unanswered.
First, if the bat transmits the SARS-CoV-2 inheritance virus to the mill, it must be interesting to see how the bats and mills can share the same ecological nic.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, we must determine how humans get in contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, the way it interacts with different species including humans, bats and mills should be explained.
Finally, as many mammals including exotic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental monitoring and infections need to be conducted.
Whether it's a bat, mill or other mammal, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or a similar hampri parent virus will be identified in its natural host in the future.
Continuing investigations in the area will explain the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the diagnostic criteria "confident" and "confirmed cases" for COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team has published a quick advisory guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus novel infections 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline provides our experience as a good reference to fight this pandemic around the world.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is slowly increasing based on the discovery of ongoing research and clinical practice experience; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a review on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "confident" and "confirmed cases" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version) issued by the People's Republic of China's National Health Committee.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has led to an outbreak, now officially named the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO announced COVID-10 as a pandemic.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick advice guideline and the guide has been published in Military Health Research on February 06, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge increases slowly based on the discovery of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies for continuous updates.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, have issued a number of seven editions with several contexts altered by default.
Now our guidelines receive reviews by Zhou et al., they introduce easy marking recommendations based on their clinical experience.
Their efforts add new evidence to our guidelines and are also a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We recognize their important efforts and thank you.
However, their efforts also require updates according to the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh edition of the trial) and the latest study.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case requires a combination of any one item of epidemiological history features with two clinical manifestations items to produce a thorough analysis, or need to meet three clinical manifestations items without a clear epidemiological history:
History of epidemiology: (1) History of travel or living in the city of Wuhan and the area of the prefecture, or other communities where COVID-19 cases are reported within 14 days before symptoms begin; (2) history of contact with SAR-CoV-2 cases (with positive test of nucleic acids); (3) history relating to patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) the amount of white blood cell count indicates normal, degenerated, or reduced lymphocytes count at the initial stage.
A confirmed case diagnosis should be based on a case suspected of any one pathogenic item or serological evidence as follows: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) genome reference of the entire virus shows high homogenity to known novel coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM antibody or IgG antibody specific to SACo-2
We can see that real-time PCR tests for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples have been added to the second edition (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples has been included in the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); and then serological evidence is included in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the continuous work of researchers looking for optimum nucleic acid detection kits for immediate detection, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which increase the availability of different specimens, and support bringing positive results of antibodies specifically into the criteria that have been confirmed.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to be vigilant with typical or asymptomatic symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow charts from Zhou et al. should be updated, as they describe invidivu without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also be certified in subsequent clinical practice and study.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come and call on the reader to give a comment.
For the diagnosis of "confidentatedkes" and "confirmedkes", we recommend to track and comply with the new guidelines of their home country.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily number
Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest death toll in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Disease Studies (IEDCR) reported the number of reported infections including 114 active cases and 33 recovering cases sitting at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are aged over 60, two of which are 51 and 60, and 41-50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19 a pandemic on March 11.
Hospital officials told a local news source, the Anadolu Agency that one of the sick was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was hospitalized at Kuwait's Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridge Obaidul <0x51>uader said public transport would be closed longer than the original plan, until Saturday.
The closure of public transportation was originally started on March 26 and was planned to expire on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of important goods -- medicines, oils and food -- are still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection incident recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people returning from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, all three have been healed.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, an outbreak caused by the coronavirus.
The benchmark came on the same day Malawi confirmed the first coronavirus infection and Zambia had the first death associated with the coronavirus.
North Korea claims, as of Thursday, it is among several countries free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours ahead of 10 a.m. Middle European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were reported, contributing to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS reported, citing data from Johns Hopxins University, more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. on Wednesday from coronavirus infection.
Worldwide, countries announce stricter measures to stop the outbreak from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergie Sobyanin, the city's head of Moscow, extended the city's closure until 1 May.
Throughout the country, President Vladimir Putin has confirmed that Russians may continue to be paid salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the emergency to 15 days; the vote was confirmed with 215 votes in support, ten exceptions, and one in opposition.
Saudi Arabia extended lockdown orders in the holy cities of Makkah and Medina to all day long; previously, a lockdown order was carried out only between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to carry out a lockdown order between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to sit at home until May 1.
Shops in Australia have lowered the limit of toilet tissue once a transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, the Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet tissue to two and one package once each transaction at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also introduced a package limit, on Monday.
This limit was broadcast as an order on the exit list, and on the chain’s Facebook page.
Buyers are reported to buy stocks due to COVID-19 fears if individuals need to alienate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet tissue for the purchase of delivery to a pack of each order.
This change followed a four-pack restriction for each transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in a media release on March 8, reported that with the implementation of a four-pack restriction, "many stores still run out of stock in an hour after delivery", and called a request as "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales rose in a "short increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco's shop in Canberra also limits the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To continue to alleviate deficiencies, Coles booked packages larger than suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths booked additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks for special Wednesday plans could be obtained early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Consumer Association, said that retailers were trying to add stock but local council restrictions at the time of delivery by trucks made it difficult.
He expects an increase in the cost of the product, when the supplier tries to meet the demand, and a little special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following initial stock production, some stores could not run special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from <0x51>ueensland University of Technology, said the store saturated the stock every night.
He told the toilet tissue was a large item, leading to a low quantity on the amount of stock, and, when sold out, left the vast shelf space empty, reinforced the feeling of lack.
Coles and Woolworths have a view of [that] if there are a variety of items on the shelf, if products such as toilet tissue and fermented materials can [buy] and have quantity, you'll probably reduce panic," Russell Zimmerman said on ABC News.
Toilet manufacturers recycled publisher Who Gives a Crap on Wednesday and they have run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex Toilet Tissues, and Solaris Paper that makes Sorbent, confirms that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to a New.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports several real estate sellers offer toilet tissue for free to the first bidder at an auction session in Melbourne, when little auctions are held as a result of buyers facing holidays during long holidays on Labor Day.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily print in Darwin, included eight additional pages aimed at cut and used as toilet tissue.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3, which saw them saying they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also received high demand, including masks, fermented materials, dry foods, hand washing tools and floors.
As well as outside Australia, on Sunday evening the online supermarket Ocado was seen limiting the purchase of Andres toilet tissue to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) of the COVID-19 outbreak — a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — was a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent to which the disease has spread, not how dangerous a particular case is, WHO realizes the need to urge the government to act:
All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, alienate, track and move their people to act, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned about both the level of transmission and the alarming severity as well as the level of inactivity that is alarming.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic "has never happened before."
He said in a statement published by CNN in February, "aside from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected from the emergence to the ongoing worldwide transmission."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we've never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a pandemic was followed by WHO's decision in January to announce the outbreak as a public health emergency internationally.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "shortly, things will get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, causing more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is a 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) that is underway, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was announced as a General Health Emergency at the International Ranking on 30 January 2020, and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, causing approximately 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have been healed.
The rate of deaths has been estimated at 4<0x25> in China, while worldwide between 13.04<0x25> in Algeria to .08<0x25> in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the start of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may be between two to fourteen days.
No vaccines or special antiviral treatments are known.
The main treatments are symptomatic therapy and support. The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, closing mouth during coughs, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring and isolation for those who suspect themselves to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by carrying out travel restrictions, quarantines, locked orders, hazard control at work and shutting down facilities.
The pandemic has led to global socioeconomic disruption, suspension or cancellation of sporting events, religion, politics and culture, as well as widespread shortages of supplies fueled by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have been closed either nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4<0x25> of the world's student population.
The misinformation of the virus has been spread online, and there are incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent, as well as those from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution as well as carbon liberation.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the state capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases from unknown causes on 31 December 2019, and investigations were launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases are related to the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market and cause the virus to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the coronavirus of bats, coronavirus grinders, and SARS-CoV.The earliest person known to have the symptoms was later found to have fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent relationship with the later wet market cluster.
For the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case detected back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province, may be the first case.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, during a new case reported according to China but abruptly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has exceeded the number of new cases.
There may be a number of unreported cases corresponding, especially among them with milder symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases have been reported among adolescents, with those aged 19 and below equaling 2.4<0x25> of cases worldwide. The chief scientific adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60<0x25> of British population should be infected before effective group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been positively confirmed according to the official protocol.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and many countries have had an official policy not to test those with mild symptoms alone, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, an estimated 86<0x25> of COVID-19 infections have not been detected, and that these unrecorded infections are a source for 79<0x25> of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is greater than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the number increase (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formulated that the number may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not, the developmental period of symptoms up to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80<0x25> of deaths are among those over the age of 60, and 75<0x25> have existing health problems including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official death count of the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to people who have been tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who die without being tested - cth. at home, in the care center, etc.
A partial data from Italy found that the number of excessive deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count with a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated "We know that [the number of deaths stated] is budgeting less", a statement backed by an insulated report on the lack of counting in the U.S. The less budgeting occurs frequently in the pandemic, such as during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic, the first confirmed death in Wu1 in the U.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and regions have reported deaths, in every continent except Antarctica. Several measures have been used in common to declare the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by area and by time, as well as influenced by the number of tests, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time from early outbreaks, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The mortality ratio with the case describes the number of deaths divided by the diagnosed cases in given time intervals.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate was 6.0<0x25> (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers vary depending on the area.
In China, the estimate for the mortality ratio with the case decreased from 17.3<0x25> (for those with symptoms from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7<0x25> (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020). Other rates include the death rate of the case (CFR), which describes the percentage of those diagnosed as a result of the disease, and the death rate of the infection (IFR), which describes the percentage of those who were infected with the disease.
These statistics are not tied to time and follow a special population from infection through case solutions.
A number of academics have tried to calculate this number for a specific population.
The University of Oxford's Evidence-Based Medicine Center said that the death rate of infection for the pandemic as a whole was between 0.1<0x25> and 0.39<0x25>.
The top budget for this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany, and statistical studies that analyze the effects of the test on the CFR budget.
The WHO has confirmed that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and peak period of the outbreak is uncertain and can vary according to location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University stated, "Letting unchecked, infectious outbreaks usually horizontally and then begin to deteriorate when the disease runs out of homes available.
But it's almost impossible to make any reasonable assumptions now about the time that the situation will take place."
China's government's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that the "pandemic could end by June" if all countries could be moved to comply with WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London Tropical <0x26> Medical School stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for a year or two".
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical partnerships and other measures will be required "so vaccines are available (perhaps 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I don't think it's possible that this coronavirus — because it's so infectious — will disappear completely" and it "may be a seasonal disease, reappears every year".
The fertility of the reappearance will depend on the group's immunity and mutation stage.
Covid-19 symptoms can be relatively unspecific and people infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88<0x25>) and dry cough (68<0x25>).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum (pain), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle pain and joints, sore throat, cold, vomiting, hemoptosis, diarrhea or cyanosis. The WHO states that about one in six people become very sick and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, pain or stress on the persistent chest, shocking confusion, difficulty to wake up, and the eyes or lips become bluish; medical treatment is immediately advised if this symptom is present. The subsequent increase of the disease can lead to severe constipation, acurulated constipation.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, so researchers have issued advice that they with close contact with infected people should be closely monitored and examined to ensure there is no infection.
China estimates asymptomatic ratios range from slightly to 44<0x25>.
The normal period of immersion (time between infections and symptoms begins) ranges from one to 14 days; most commonly five days.For example uncertainty, the fractional budget of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell at first 30<0x25> and then decreased to 15<0x25>.
Some details about the way the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread primarily during close contact and through small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact being at a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that unprotected coughs will cause ai droplets to move up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus may also be transferred through permanent small droplets for longer periods in the air, which may be generated during conversation. Breathing drops may also result during breathing release, including during speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
The Titisan can land in the mouth or nose of a nearby person or may be sucked into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretion to overburden and therefore result in airborne dispersal.
The virus can also be spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then they touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns that viruses can spread through stools, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of the transmission of stool to the mouth of SARS-CoV-2.Virus is most likely to become infectious during the first three days after the start of the symptoms, but the infection may occur before the symptoms appear and at the later stage for the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease for up to three days before the start of symptoms suggest that transmission can occur before significant symptoms occur.
Few reports of confirmed asymptomatic cases of the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact detection investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not very clear how easy the disease is to spread, one usually infects two to three others. The virus lasts for hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for a day on cartons, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence to suggest that animals can transfer the virus to humans, but British authorities have advised to wash their hands after touching the animal, such as after touching other surfaces that may have been touched by those infected.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus novel apply in relation to coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective sheath.SARS-CoV-2 is very closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (general B) along with two beans derived from bats.
The virus is 96<0x25> similar at the genome level full of another coronavirus sample (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain sections of genome sequences between viruses from grinding with viruses from humans.
The difference between the entire genome so far has found that most 92<0x25> of the genetic material is shared between the grinding coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove the mill as an intermediate housewife.
Infection by the virus can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although the tester eventually through transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for infectious secretion or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specifically, with most of its imaging features overlap with the process of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American Radiology College recommended that "CT should not be used to filter or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-1, with the first issued on January 17.
The test uses a reverse transcription of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on a respiratory or blood sample.
Test results are usually available within a few hours to several days.
Usually this test is carried out with nasofaringeal swabs but estrogen swabs can also be used. A number of labs and companies are developing serology tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests have proved appropriate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S. a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by only certified laboratories.
Feature imaging features on computerized radiographs and tomography (CTs) for the symptoms include asymmetric soil glass relief and pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiology Association is collecting online databases between the agencies to find inmates for confirmed cases.
As a result of predation with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR's verification tnpa reimagination has a limited specialization in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although imaging is less specific for infections, the method is faster and more sensitive, suggesting considerations of the method as a screening tool in the epidemic area.
A network of artificial intelligence-based exchange nerves has been developed to detect virus imaging cii with both radiographs and CT.
Strategies to prevent disease transmission include maintaining good overall self-hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwash hands, and coughing or sneezing on the tissues and putting the tissue directly into the waste container.
Those who may have been infected have been advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical looting measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have blocked or advised to avoid all unessential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the level of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spread in the community, and some community members do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers who care for someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact detection is an important method to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by the government for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations releasing statements requesting restrictions on such surveillance.
Multiple mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to blog close to a user with another cell phone.
Users then receive a message if they have contacted someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Mistakes are circulating about ways to prevent infection; for example, rinse the nose and simmer with dessert medications are ineffective.
There are no COVID-19 vaccines, although many organizations are trying to develop vaccines.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the outbreak.
The CDC recommends that the community wash their hands regularly using soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; and after exhaling nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective bubble.
The CDC further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitation with at least 60<0x25> alcohol according to content when soap and water are not available for use.
WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwash hands.
Surfaces may be contaminated with a number of solutions (in one minute exposure to infection for stainless steel surfaces), including 62–71<0x25> ethanol, 50–100<0x25> isopropanol, 0.1<0x25> sodium hypochlorite, 0.5<0x25> hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5<0x25> povidon-iodin.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate chrohexidine, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID cases are suspected or confirmed in facilities such as offices or daily care centers, all areas such as offices, water rooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control devices and ATM machines used by sick people, should be drained.
Health organizations recommend that people close their mouths and noses with bent arms or tissues during coughing or sneezing, and remove any tissue immediately.
surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing masks can limit the number and distance of expiration drops that are spread during speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and way to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Using masks can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is the main source of infection without proper hand hygiene care."
WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of people who have COVID-19, although they also admit that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to promote the use of face masks by community members.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made from cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy community members, especially when contacting closely (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask while using public transport or in a crowded place.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia ban from going out to public places without wearing masks or covering one’s nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear face masks when they went to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government determined that everyone entering the grocery store should wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks every day since mid-March, has asked intercity train and bus passengers to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has required the use of face masks when it comes out, while also recommending making face masks at home for those who can't buy face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical looting) is accompanied by infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using touchless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments now require or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum assembly size recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no known COVID-19 transmission in the region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned general gatherings by more than two people. Older adults and those with hidden health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems faced increased risks for serious diseases and complications and had been advised by the CDC to remain at home as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks. At the beginning of March 2020, the WHO
The use of the term "social jail" has led to the implication that people should undergo full social isolation, rather than encouraging them to get in touch with others through alternative ways. Some parties have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes suggestions for having sex only with someone who lives with you, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been suggested to those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or proposed self-quarantine to the entire population living in the affected area.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those who belong to a high-risk group.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have previously traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of possible last exposure.
The strategy in regulating outbreaks is to stem or oppress, and to reduce.
The contamination is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and alienate those infected as well as introduce measures of infection control and other vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to stem the transmission of the disease, the effort then switches to the emission stage: measures are taken to slow the transmission and reduce its impact on health care systems as well as the community.
The combination of steps stemming and reducing may be carried out at the same time.
Pressure requires a more decisive step to step down the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproduction to less than 1. Some of them taking care of the transmission of infectious diseases is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as flattening the epidemic hull.
This reduces the risk of health services being overloaded and provides more time for vaccines as well as developed treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical handicaps that can handle transmissions include personal precautions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures targeted at physical looting such as closing schools and canceling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures
Other countries also take various measures targeted at limiting the transmission of the virus.
South Korea introduced massive screenings and local quarantines, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provides financial support to those infected who quarantine themselves and impose high fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and fined the ignition of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States showed that reductions (reducing but not stopping epidemic spread) and emphasis (reducing epidemic growth) had great challenges.
Optimum reduction policies may reduce health care demands that peak to 2/3 and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being burdened.
Actions can be an option but need to be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine exists, if it comes first), as the spread will immediately rejuvenate when the preventive measures are loosened.
A long-term hand mix to suppress the pandemic resulted in social and economic costs.
No antiviral drugs are specifically approved for COVID-19, but its development efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Eating cold medications given in the counter, drinking water and rest will help alleviate the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the consequences.
Some compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some "traditional and domestic treatments" can give relief to symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and health care adjustments for the needs of COVID-19 patients are described by the WHO as a basic pandemic response step.
The ECDC and WHO offices of the European region have issued guidelines for hospitals and key healthcare services to move resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services towards the COVID-19 test, canceling elective procedures when necessary, separating and alienating positive patients of COVID-19, as well as improving the ability of treatment by training personnel and beds available ventilators.
There are a variety of theories about where the first case (which patients call the empty number) came from.
The first case of the known novel coronavirus can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has slowly increased.
This case is mostly associated with Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market, which also sells living animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, has a zoonotic origin. The lung inflammatory cluster of yag unknown causes has been observed on December 26 and treated by Zhang Jixian doctor at Hubei County Hospital, Wulum
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Center Hospital informed their colleagues about "coronaviruses like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, have been warned by police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen, has been reprimanded by his superiors for raising the matter.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on December 31 and notified WHO.
The insufficient cases of lung inflammation have been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to trigger investigations in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was spread to other parts of China, aided by China's New Year's migration and Wuhan's becoming a transport hub as well as a major train exchange site.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms on January 20, 2020. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
About 200 countries and regions have at least one case.
As a result of this pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and implemented border control.
National reactions have included preventive measures such as quarantine (known as home sitting orders, shelter instructions, or emergency) and lockdown orders.As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90<0x25> of the population, are under a form of emergency in the United States, more than 50 million people are in emergency in the Philippines, approximately 59 million people in emergency.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a form of emergency, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later—about one-third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID 19 was detected back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggested the earliest case was on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixiang observed an unknown cluster of pneumonia cases on December 26, then his hospital told CDC Wuhan Jianghan on December 27.
Early genetic tests for patient samples on December 27, 2019 showed the presence of coronaviruses such as SARS.
Public notice has been issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 Dec.
The WHO was announced the same day.
During this notice, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumours" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" about human transmission to humans.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party secretary-general <0x58>i Jinping as a "people's war" to prevent the spread of the virus.
In what has been called "the largest quarantine in human history", the quarantine's quarantine was announced on January 23 that stopped the trip into and out of Wuhan, which has continued to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting at least 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) are cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the temporary construction of the hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was built after, Leishenshan Hospital, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also remodeled 14 other facilities in Wuhan such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government embarked on the next step to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, including issuing a health declaration for travelers and continuing the holiday of the Flower Festival.

Working from a distance has begun in some parts of China.
Travel restrictions are designed inside and outside of Hubei.
Public transport has been modified, and museums across China have been closed for a while.
Public movement control has been carried out in many cities, and has been estimated to be around 760 million people (more than half the population) facing some sort of external restrictions. After the transmission entered the global phase in Mac, the Chinese government took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, China’s Great Land was only one case of deployment in the country within 5 days, in this example the traveler returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the case of domestic disseminated was essentially blocked and its transfer had been controlled by China.
The same day travel restrictions have been loosened in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the emergency came into force. Minister of Foreign Affairs of China announced on 26 March 2020 that entry through a visa or resident permit holder would be suspended from 28 March onwards, without any specific details about the time this policy will expire.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and the preparation of financial stimulus packages to firms.

South Korea introduced a program that is considered the world’s most segregated and organized program to screen the population to detect the virus, and alienate any infected individuals as well as track and quarantine those associated with them.
Screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptons by new international arrivals through mobile applications, last-decision guided virus tests available the next day, and increased test capabilities that allow up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining the entire city. The South Korean community initially split for President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.

The technology industry has especially warned about the delay in delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the usual price and also led to a delay in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
It also causes a shortage of personal protection equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that this will harm the health of employees.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The activity has led to a shortage of infant formulas in some supermarkets and has been banned by the Australian government before. Behind the prevalens of high COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as a constant high demand for food products, both areas have survived severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy to fight the accumulation of goods and illegal sales of important products have been successful, avoiding the severe shortages of food that have been expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with significant agricultural expenditures did not see a significant reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food racks are only temporary, even in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials are releasing shinzir deposits to ensure adequate efficacy for the population.
The same law exists in Italy requires food producers to store reserves for such an emergency.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, China's economy has been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 as a result of measures taken by the government to control the spread of the virus, and retail sales plunged by 20.5<0x25>.

This also led to a 33-43<0x25> fall in traffic walking to a shopping mall in March compared to February.
Worldwide shopping center operators carry out additional measures, for example increasing hygiene, installing heat scanners to check visitor temperatures, and cancel events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, pandemic-driven recession can lead to an additional between 14 and 22 million people experiencing extreme poverty in Latin America compared to those in the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, when an epidemic peak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the nearly 300 million migrant workers from outside China have been stranded at home in the interior or trapped in the Hubei Region. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.

An emergency in India has caused tens of millions of foreign workers in India (paid through daily salary) to not work. Reviews from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44<0x25> of Canadian households experienced similar occupations.
By mid-March, 4 million French workers applied for non-work temporarily and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit schemes. Nearly half a million companies in Germany had sent their workers to a government-subsidized short-term employee scheme known as the Kurzarbeit.
Short-term work compensation schemes have been implemented by France and Britain.
The exhibition sector of art and cultural heritage has been deeply impressed by the pandemic, impacting the organization's operations as well as the individuals both working on salaries and free labor - around the world.
Organizations of the arts and culture sectors try to improve their mission (usually publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to society, maintain the safety of their employees and communities, as well as support artists when possible.
As of March 202, worldwide and at varying levels, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions have closed exhibitions, event organizing and performances cancelled and delayed until indefinite time.
In feedback, there are intensive measures to provide alternative services through digital platefox. Another recent and increasingly devastating fall resulting from the outbreak is the cancellation of religious services, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music and concert festivals, technology seminars, and fashion shows.
The film industry was also affected. The Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy Sunday in Rome, which took place during the last week of Lent's Christian repentant season, had been cancelled.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, prejudices, xenophobia and rising racism have been observed against Chinese and East Asian ancestry, and against people from hot locations in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and roughness have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) have recorded racist sentiments described in various groups around the world saying Chinese people deserve the virus or accept the alleged matter as a fair retaliation.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiments.
Most Wuhan and Hubei residents have reported discrimination based on their original territory.
There is support for China, both indoors and offline, as well as against them in severe areas of the virus.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods for detecting the presence of viruses as well as methods that detect antibodies produced in response to infections.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by the RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect RNA virus SARS-CoV-2.
The test is used to confirm a very new or active infection.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population supervision.
Antibody tests show the number of patients who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or who are asymptomatic.
The death rate due to proper disease and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
As a result of the limited test, as of March 2020, no country has expected data on virus prevalens in their population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of their population, and there is a considerable diversity in the number of tests that have been conducted across countries.
This diversity will also likely affect the reported rate of deaths, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using a polymerase chain reverse transcription reaction (rRT-PCR) real-time test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through a variety of methods, including nasofaringeal swabs and sputum samples.
The decision is usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test conducted with an esophagus swab can only be trusted in the first week of the disease.
Then the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For those infected tested in the second mingu, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from within the airway yag in using an induction catheter or the material causing a cough (sputum) to be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at Charit<0xC3><0xA9> in Berlin in January 2020 using a polymerase-reaction reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) in real-time, and was the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom has also developed tests by January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kid, silicon grade (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It is looking for "E" genes shared by all beta Coronaviruses, and RdRp genes specifically to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Product Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Diseases (CD)
One of the three genetic tests in the old version of the test kit led to uncertain results from damaged reagents, and bottle neck tests at CDC in Atlanta; this averaged less than 100 samples a day successfully processed throughout February 2020;
Tests using two components cannot be trusted until February 28, 2020, and before that state and local labs were allowed to start the test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Act. The U.S. commercial laboratory began the test in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020 LabCorp announced the availability of the COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR across the country.
<0x51>uest Diagnostics also makes the COVID-19 test available nationwide as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit has been announced; the collection of specimens and processing must be carried out according to the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test has been developed and produced by the VECTOR State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center.
On February 11, 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Oversight in Health. On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly developed the test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that could be done within 3.5 hours in high numbers, while allowing a machine to approximately
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the permission of emergency use (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for tests on the Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar truths to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EU from the FDA for a test that took approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nucleic acid enlargement technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can give positive results within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
Currently there are approximately 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to accelerate production to send 50,000 tests a day. Tests that use monoclon antibodies that specifically bind to the proteon nucleocapsid (N protein) novel coronavirus are being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation that the test can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes the same inf.
In March 2020 a review of the writing concluded that "the chest radiograph had a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while the discovery of CT [computer-computed tomography] may have been present even before symptoms began."
Typical features of CT include the thickness of the dusis multilobar soil glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior scattering.
Subpleura dominance, crazy opening and merger are formed when the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the origin point of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specifically, with many imaging features acting with the process of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American Radiology College recommended that "CT should not be used to filter or as the first line test to diagnose COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial filters.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals starting 7 days or so after symptoms begin, to determine numbness, and in population supervision. Assessment can be done in the central laboratory (CLT) or through point-of-care (PoCT) testing.
The high-circuit automatic system in many clinical laboratories will be able to carry out this assessment but its availability will depend on the income rate for each system.
For CLT single specimens of peripheric blood is usually used, although serialized specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT a single blood specimen is usually obtained through puncture on the skin.
Unlike the PCR method of stratification measures was not required prior to assessment. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that gave the agency the information as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibodies tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under the consent of emergency use.IBy the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples within a few hours and therefore much faster the conventional PCR assessment area for viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the infection began. In early April, the UK found no antibodies testing kit purchased is good enough to use.
Hong Kong has provided a scheme that sees patients suspected of staying at home, "anxiety departments will provide patients with a patient's medical care tube", they spit into the tube, relay and get test results shortly afterwards. NHS British has announced that it is pioneering a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of patients infecting others if they go to their patients.
The drive center has helped South Korea perform among the fastest, most comprehensive tests compared to other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Experts said on March 2, that they had a capacity of 12,000 tests a day in the ambulatory atmosphere and 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The cost is borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a medical professional.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Jerrman has a total capacity of 160,000 tests a week.
As of March 19, the driver test has been offered in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020 the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory review revealed that up to the 12/2020 calendar week of at least 483,295 samples were tested including 12/20 weeks and 33,491 samples (6.9<0x25>) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion Hospital and Rambam developed and tested methods for testing samples from 64 patients with a sample.
With construction monitored by BGI founder Wan Jian and taking 5 days, the model has shown cases in Hubei will be 47<0x25> higher and the corresponding cost of handling the quarantine will double if the test capacity does not reach the target.
Wuhan's laboratory has been immediately followed by Hou Yan's laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020 the total daily total is 50,000 tests a day. Open source, multiplex design issued by Origami Assays has been issued which can test as many as 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 assessments. This balanced design can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid operators.
As of March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents have made it short for massive tests in the EU and in the UK and in the US.
This has prompted some authors to explore sample preparation protocols involving heating samples at 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to remove the RNA genome for the next test. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emeriah is testing more of its people for the Coronavirus of each head than any other country, and is on the right path to increase the scale of the population to achieve part of the test.
This is through a combination of past guided capabilities, and the purchase of large-scale population-scale-processing laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on the emergency detection lab "Hou-Yan" in China)
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first in the world on this scale to be operated outside China.
Different exams target different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted German methods for the production of kits sent to low-income countries without resources to develop their own kits.
The German method was published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control did not exist until January 28, slowing existing tests in the U.S. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of its launch, and the country and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet demand and recommendations for exams by health experts.
On the other hand, experts told South Korea's broad willingness to make tests help reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The test capacity, mostly in the private sector lab, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called on improving the test program as the best way to slow the speed of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus led to hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of supplies of supplies and chemical agents became limited.
In March 2020 China reported problems with accuracy on their test kits.
In the United States, the CDC-developed test kit has a "weakness;" the government subsequently issued bureaucracy restrictions that have prevented private testing. The Spanish state bought the test kit from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co ltd, but found the results were inaccurate.
The firm explains that an inaccurate decision may be the result of a failure to collect samples or use the kit correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it would retrieve the kit that returned the wrong decision, and would replace it with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioasy.80<0x25> of the test kit the Chech Republic of China bought the wrong decision. The Slovak country bought 1.2 million test kits from China found inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that the kit be dumped to Danube.Ates Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health told the test kit Turkey bought from China had "high error rates" and did not "use it". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced this test kit should not be used.
The test, followed by quarantining those tested positive and detecting those associated with positive individuals SARS-CoV-2 in, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the site of the first COVID-19 deaths in Italy, conducted two test rounds in the entire population of nearly 3,400 people, about a ten-day hose.
Nearly half of the positively tested individuals had no symptoms, and all of the cases found were quarantined.
With the travel restrictions, it has eliminated a new infection in its entirety.
With aggressive contact detection, incoming travel restrictions, exams, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has moved slower than other developing countries, but without firm restrictions such as forcibly closing restaurants and retail stores.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has started to advise its citizens to sit at home on March 28, but the school will be reopened in time after the holidays on March 23.
Several other countries have also been controlling reflectors by detecting aggressive contacts, entry travel restrictions, exams and quarantines, but with less aggressive emergency orders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that more countries made tests, relative to the number of deaths, had a low mortality rate, probably because these countries were able to detect those who only had mild or no direct symptoms better.
The WHO recommends that countries who do not have the national test and laboratory capacity with limited experience of COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for the verification test.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are found in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "Positive as <0x25> test" column is affected by the country's test policy.
Countries that only test individuals admitted to hospitals will get a higher positive value as <0x25> test compared to countries that test all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the rest are the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning a person's hand aimed at removing soil, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as nausea and years, which are spread through the dirt pathway to the mouth.
Individuals can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
Five critical times during the day that watch wash your hands with soap are important include: before and after removing large water, after cleaning the child's back or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
If water and soap are not present, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
before and after the treatment of the sick.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child who has been using the toilet.
After rinsing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clear the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important to people who control food or work in medicine, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decrease the death rate of the baby at birth at home.
A 2013 study showed improved hand washing practices would lead to a small increase in high growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and nausea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple step can reduce the death rate from the disease to almost 50<0x25>.
Interventions that recommend hand washing can reduce the episode of pimples by about one-third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48<0x25> reduction in the episode of nausea can be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to avoid diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI), as an automatic behavior performed at home, school and society around the world.
Pneumonia, the main ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under the age of five, sacrificing the lives of approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Cirith and pneumonia together cause nearly 3.5 million children's deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, instilling hand washing habits with soap before eating and after using toilets can save more lives than any single vaccine or mix of drugs, reducing death from diarrhea by almost half and dying from acute respiratory infections by nearly one-quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation interventions as part of a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing can also protect against impetigo transferred through direct physical contact.
A small adverse effect when washing your hands too often is that washing your hands too hard can lead to skin damage due to dryness on the skin.
A study from Denmark in 2012 found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, a condition of scaly skin known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among health care workers.
Too often hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day in which washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transfer of stool to the mouth: after using the toilet (fish, beak), after cleaning the back of the child (crushing the diaper), before evaporating the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
Another time when proper hand washing should be practiced to prevent the spread of the disease including before and after treating cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or exhaling the nose; after touching the animal's stool or controlling the animal; and after holding the trash.
The rate of hand washing using soap is low in most countries.
In 2015, a study of hand washing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7<0x25> of households had a practice of hand washing with soap. In 2014, studies showed Saudi Arabia had a high rate of 97<0x25>; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at a low of 23 percent. Some methodologies of behavioral change now exist to improve hand washing with hands.
The Important Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale action for fostering children's health and education.
Washing twice a year, plus washing your hands daily with soap, and brushing your teeth daily with florida.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin can be enhanced by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce the obstacles on the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an efficient skin cleaner because of fat and protein, which is an organic soil component, is insoluble in water.
However, appropriate water flow helps with cleaning.
Due to its reusable nature, kettle soap may store bacteria derived from previous use.
A small study on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated kettle soap found that transfers were unlikely because bacteria were removed when washed with foam.
The CDC site still states "the liquid soap released without using the hand is better".
Antibacterial soaps get a high promotion to people who are important to health.
There is no evidence so far that using antiseptic or disinfectant recommended selecting antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain regular antibacterial agents such as tricksans, which have a wide list of resistance to organism strains.
So, although antibodies-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective agents, this advanced formulation may contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and further skin fireplace (aloe vera, vitamins, bulbs, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University's Public Health Faculty suggests that Occupation
Water is not too hot to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, soapy water is more effective than soapy cold water to remove natural oils that have soil and bacteria.
Unlike many people believe, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial content in the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the alcohol supply of non-water-based hand-cleaning agents (also known as alcohol-based gooses, antiseptic hand scoops, or hand cleansers) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated along with thickening agents such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymers) into the gel, or humectants such as glycerin into liquids, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the effects of alcohol drying.
By adding liquid hydrogen peroxide will further increase antimicrobial activity. Hand cleansers containing a minimum of 60 to 95<0x25> alcohol is an efficient germ remover.
Alcohol extract kills bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and several viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol supply cleaners containing 70<0x25> alcohol kill 99.97<0x25> (3.5 log reduction, equal to 35 decibels reduction) bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99<0x25> (reduction of 4 to 5 logs) bacteria in the hands 1 minute after use. Hand cleanser is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand cleansers are almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus type virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A sufficient hand antiseptic or alcohol supply must be used to correct or correct both hands.
The front and back of both hands and between the ends of all the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel becomes dry.
Finger tips should also be well washed, by rubbing them on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than hand cleaning, especially when the hands appear dirty.
The increased use of this agent due to its easy use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms. However, it cannot replace proper hand washing unless there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand cleansing can often cause dry skin unless emolient and/or skin moisturizer is added to the formula.
The effects of drying alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients led to a significant reduction in irritability and dryness in the skin compared to soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol addicts or additional substances in alcohol hand supply is rare.
The tendency to further reduce contact dermatitis is to attract more than using soap and water to wash hands.
The agent is not water, though effective, does not clean the hands of organic matter. It simply eradicates germs.
This is because hand cleansers are not as effective as soaps and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens are still on hand.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand-cleaning depends high on its ingredients and its formulations, and in its history it is less successful than alcohol and alcoholic beverages.
Later on, the formulation that uses benzalkonium chloride has been proven to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol which has been proven to decrease its effectiveness after use many times, is likely due to progressively inappropriate reactions to the skin.
Most low-income people are unable to have soaps, instead they use ash or soil.
Abus or soil may be more effective than using water alone but may be less effective than soap.
Concerns exist if soil or ash are contaminated with microorganisms that may increase from reducing the spread of the disease.
Abu is also a germ-like agent because it forms an alkaline solution if it has contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap if soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends proper hand washing techniques to prevent transmission of the disease including the following steps:
Hands wet with warm or cold water.
Water flow is recommended because standing beans may be contaminated, at the same time the water temperature does not seem to have an effect.
Wash your hands while rubbing it with a lot of soap, including the back of your hand, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than just water.
Mental for at least 20 seconds.
Dying creates a shift, which helps remove germs from the skin, and intensifies longer to remove more germs.
Blend well with flowing water.
Smelling in the beads can recharge the hands.
Dry it with a clean towel or let it dry by air.
Wet and moist hands are easier to get dirty again. Fingers, wrists, sections between fingers and under finger nails are the part that is always overlooked.
Microorganisms may be stored in fake nails and peeled nail paints.
Moisture loss is often recommended to avoid the hand from being dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transfer.
There are a wide range of cheap options for ease of hand washing if there is no pipe water and/or soap, cth. pouring water from hanging cans or pumpkins with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. If water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions that save water such as "ippi pipes" and other cheap options.
Tippi pipe is an easy technology that uses a strap-mounted jag, and a foot-controlled lever to pour a little water over the hands and a soap.
An important part of the hand cleaning process is effective hand drying, but there is debate about the most effective form of drying in public water rooms.
More and more studies have shown that paper towels are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in most water rooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of hygiene when using paper towels, warm air hand dryers and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, the number of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertips was found to increase by an average of 194<0x25> and on the site by 254<0x25>.
Drying with jet air dryer causes an increase in the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertips on average by 42<0x25> and on the palms by 15<0x25>.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the end is generally reduced to 76<0x25> and on the palm up to 77<0x25>. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether cross pollution could potentially occur from other users of the bathroom and the water room environment of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which exhales the air out of the unit at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 bsj), is capable of exhaling microorganisms from the hands and units and potentially contaminates other users of the water room and the water room environment as far as 2 meters away.
The use of warm air hand dryers spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from dryers.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Product und Umwelt assessed different methods of hand drying.
The following changes are found in bacterial count after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers compared to paper towels for drying.
Washing your hands using hand cleaning tissue is an alternative option when traveling without soap and water.
Alcohol hand cleaners should contain at least 60<0x25> alcohol.
Hand washing for medicine has long been a duty when doctors Ignaz Semmelweis of Hungary discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital environments.
There are electronic devices that warn hospital staff to wash their hands when they are forgotten.
One study found that its use could lower the rate of infection.
Wash your hands in medicine for at least 15 seconds, using a lot of soap and water or gel to touch and rub each part of your hand.
The hands need to be rubbed together with the fingers inserted thoroughly.
If there is dirt under the nails, the fur brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in water on hand, we need to rinse them well and wipe them until dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hand, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open the exit if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting dirty again when touching the surface.
Hand washing in a health care environment is aimed at removing pathogenic microorganisms ("cumen") and avoiding spreading them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that less permanent hand washing is at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forgotten to wash their hands before touching the patient, thus spreading microorganisms.
One study showed proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce catheter-related blood flow infection rates by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published one document showing standards of how to wash and rub hands in the healthcare sector.
Guided drafts on hand hygiene by this organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
Relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and confirm hand hygiene, if a regulatory compliance demonstration is required.
The World Health Organization has a "Five Moments" to wash hands:
After being exposed to the blood/silver
before the aseptic task, and
after treating the patient. Supplementary antiseptic chemicals on the soap (the soap "surgical" or "antimicrobial") give the act of killing the hand washing agent.
Such a murder action may be desirable before surgery or in a situation where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. To 'clean' a person's hand for surgery, there should be a pipe that can be turned on and turned off without touching by hand, some chlorhexidine or iodine washing, other sterile towels to wash hands after washing, and brushes
All items must be removed.
The procedure requires washing the hands and lower arms until the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
Long boiling time (10 minutes) is not required.
During rinsing, water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back to the hand.
After washing the hands, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and surgical clothes are worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use antiseptic before and after treating the sick.
In order to control staffiloccal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing came from the first 20<0x25> washing, and very little added benefit was obtained when the frequency of hand washing increased by more than 35<0x25>.
Washing with regular soap produces more than three times the rate of infectious diseases transferred to food than washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing rubbing hands with alcohol solution by washing hands with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds, each showing that rubbing hands with alcohol reduces bacterial pollution 26<0x25> more than antibacterial soaps.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handshake to reduce the influenza A H1N1 virus and clostridium difficile spores from the hands. Intervention to improve hygiene in a health care environment can involve education for staff about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand soaking, and written and orally warning to the staff.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and essential tool for achieving good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of face-to-face water supply, soap or hand washing facilities at home, at school and at work makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing pipes close to each private and public toilet are very rare, although there are cheap options available to build a hand washing station.
However, low hand washing rates can also be caused by habits embedded from lack of soap or water.
Promotion and advocacy for hand washing with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to changes in long-term behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
A systematic review of 70 studies found an effective community-based approach to improving hand washing in LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of the promotion of hand washing at school was the "Three Star Approaches" by UNICEP that advised schools to take easy and cheap steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene conditions.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one to the end of three stars.
Developing a hand washing station can be part of a hand washing promotion campaign done to reduce the disease and death of a child.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an increased awareness campaign trying to change behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, UNICEF has promoted the use of hand washing emojis.
Several studies have considered the overall cost of hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALY.
But one review showed that promoting hand washing with soap is much more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for vulnerable people such as newborn mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: a doctor from Hungarian Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Forence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time most people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food innate outbreaks and infections related to health care led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to vigorously promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to an increase in awareness about in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "the right hand washing technique" were hung next to the sink washing their hands in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing a person's hand from" means expressing a person's reluctance to take responsibility for the matter or sharing involvement in it.
It derives from the Bible verse in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase with more widespread use in some English communities.
In Macbeth by Shakespreare, Lady Macbeth began to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to wash her imaginary stains, which represented her guilt about the crime she had committed and which she influenced her husband to do.
It has been found that people, after remembering or rethinking unethical practices, tend to wash their hands more often than others and appreciate more hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such considerations are less likely to engage in other payment "wash" actions, such as making voluntary work.
Religion establishes hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Hand washing symbolically, by using soapless water to wash hands, is part of the hand washing rituals found in many religions including Bahai, Hindu, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Jewish religion, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also sets a hand washing that is especially clean after its actions.
Hinduism, Jews and Islam are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhs, Jews and Muslims also require washing their hands before and after eating.
Workplace hazard control against COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is an application for health and employment safety methodologies for hazard control to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper control of hazards at work depends on the workplace and work tasks, based on risk assessments for exposure sources, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for each worker who may be exposed to COVID-19 infections.
According to the U.S. Job Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with low exposure risk have minimal employment contact with civilians and other colleagues, which basic infection prevention measures are proposed including hand washing, encouraging workers to sit at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and maintain routine hygiene and disinfection at work.
Jobs with a moderate exposure risk include jobs that require frequent or close contact with people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected due to the transmission in an ongoing community or international travel.
This includes workers who have contacts with civilians such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and some retail environments with high volumes.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures including ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing controllers, and having self-protective equipment in the event of contact with people infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health care workers and bodyhouses exposed to people known to or suspected of having COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if employees perform an aerosol-producing procedure on, or collect or operate specimens of a person known or suspected of being infected with COVID-19.
Suitable hazard control for these workers includes engineering control such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure and self-protective equipment that suits work tasks.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have some effects on the workplace.
Workers may not be present to work due to illness, need to take care of others or be afraid of being exposed.
Trade patterns may change, either in terms of the requested goods, and how to get these items (such as shopping outside peak time or through past delivery or guided services).
Finally, the delivery of goods from the affected geographical area directly by COVID-19 may be disrupted. Preparedness and infectious disease response plans can be used as a protection action guide.
Plans to deal with risk levels related to a wide range of work sites and job tasks including exposure sources, risk factors arising from home and community environments, and risk factors for each employee such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the control necessary to address such risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparatory plans and responses to infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational plan recommendations.
Objectives for response to the outbreak include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at high risk for severe health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the business is located affects the response taken.
The hierarchy of hazard control is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control according to effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and the latter is self-protective equipment.
Engineering control involves the isolation of workers from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in the work policy or procedure that requires the actions of the employee or the employer.
Self-protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administration control but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed according to suitability (cth respirator), worn properly consistently, always checked, maintained and replaced, if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or discarded to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal employment contact with civilians and other co-workers.
The recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to sit at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics include closing when coughing and sneezing, providing tissues and waste containers, preparing for telework or work shifts if necessary, not encouraging workers to use equipment or other people's equipment, and maintain cleaning routines and maintains
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers who have acute respiratory symptoms sit at home until they are free from fever, fever signs or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using the medication to reduce fever or other changing symptoms, and flexible sick leave policies, allowing employees to sit at home to care for the family members who are aware of the disease.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk of moderate exposure include jobs that require frequent or close contact in six feet (1.8 m) of unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmissions occurring around the business location, or because the individual has recently travelled internationally to the location with the spread of COVID-19.
These include employees who have contacts with civilians such as in school, working environments with high-populated communication, visitor-compilation, high-volume communication, engineering controls, and higher-risk groups including high-efficiency air filter installing, improving ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as plastic cylinders and installing routed conveyors.
Workers in this risk group rarely require the use of respirators.
If a person falls ill on a plane, the proper control to protect employees and other passengers including alienating the sick person from another person at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew to take care of the sick person, and giving a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to close his mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew needs to wear disposable medical gloves when treating sick travellers or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and perhaps additional self-protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent coughs or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a biobathaya bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and decommissioned after that. For commercial delivery including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard control includes delaying travel when sick, seducing and informing medical centers on board immediately if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up measures should be made in the cabin of the exiled person. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or exterminating germs if the infected person has been inside the school building regardless of the spread of the community.
When there is a minimum community transmission to medium, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as canceling field visits, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education and coir classes or eating in cafeteria, adding space between tables, arrival time and ratings, limiting visitors are not important, and using separate health office locations for children with symptoms such as colds.
When there is a high transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, advanced school termination can be considered. The CDC considers the health risks of all-outs for power boosters members who perform routine activities are low.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with confirmed or suspected individuals have COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians including proper self-protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, employees need to clean up and detonate their belt and duty equipment before reuse with spray or house cleaning wipers, and follow the standard operating procedures for the contamination and disposal of PPE used and to place and wash clothes.
OSHA considers health care workers and body homes to be in a high or very high category for exposure risk.
High-risk jobs include the delivery of health care, support, laboratories and medical transport workers exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
It becomes a very high risk of exposure if the worker performs an aerosol-producing procedure on, or collects or manages specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, several dental procedures and examinations, or invasive specimen collection.
Homeworks of the bodies of high exposure risk include workers involved in providing bodies of known or suspected persons with COVID-19 cases at the time of their death; it becomes a very high risk of exposure if they do autopsy. Additional engineering controls for this risk group include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol production procedures are performed.
ventilation with special negative pressure may be appropriate in some health care venues and the body's home.
Specimens need to be controlled with caution Stage 3 of Biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends patients who will enter exiled to different waiting places depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case. In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those working within 6 feet of a known patient, or suspected, infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aeroproducing procedures.
In the United States, N95 approved or better-approved face respirators should be used in the context of a thorough and written respiratory protection program including fit tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide higher protection and increase employee comfort. WHO does not recommend cover clothes because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not spread through body fluids.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks for incoming check-in staff.
For those who collect respiratory specimens from, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, eye protection, or face protective, protective clothing and gloves.
If the aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE via telecommunications, physical barriers such as clear windows, by allowing only those involved in direct care to enter the COVID-19 patient's room, using only PPE necessary for specific tasks, continuing the use of the respirators equally without discontinuing it while caring for many patients.

SUBJEK: [Covid-19] Holds the load and is ready for the future
TARIKH/MASA HANTAR: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
CC0: There is no right to be protected
We found ourselves in such a wonderful situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes our connections in the world and the responsibilities we have against each other become apparent.
We don't have a challenge like this before, but we know that our best response depends on the type of empathy, cooperation and community building that is in the midst of this organization.
The friendships and concerns we've seen among all our colleagues via email, phone and bolts are an incredible confirmation for incredible humans we're lucky enough to be able to work together.
I am so grateful and proud to be your co-workers.
Last week, some people shared their appreciation for our work.
This reminds me of how much the world now means when it can refer to Wikipedia, and how it becomes a powerful symbol because this critical resource remains online and is available to all.
Your work makes all this possible, whether you ensure the website remains active or your colleague is paid or our community is secure.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, even more so now.
This is a moment that not only we do, but the way we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Alignment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we consider what we think will be a response in accordance with what we face and the best way to ensure that this organization can survive at this time.
Together, we want to eliminate stress and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to slow down a little, that's okay.
To all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy will be approximately 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until it is notified.
We don't announce holidays - if you can work at regular times, missions can use you.
However, the world is now unpredictable. Whether you need to take care of loved ones, buy kitchen items or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We won't record your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been told, but we told him.
You don't need a sick day or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to make sure the main field of work is covered.
(If you're diagnosed positively with COVID-19, inform Bryan in T<0x26>C Ops so that T<0x26>C can help with support and ensure your condition gets appropriate attention from management).
Those who are paid by the hour will be paid in full.
We have already informed and affirmed our commitment to respect the commitment of our contractors and staff colleagues paid by hour.
Everyone will be paid based on their regular working hours in normal circumstances.
This includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their work as a way of channeling their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be so satisfying, especially in times like this.
Again, it's about your self-care.
We just ask you to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can customize it accordingly.
Some work is considered important.
There are some things we have to keep going.
SRE teams, HR Ops, Trust <0x26> Safety, and Fundraising (among them) do critical work that may require additional assistance.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is important to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most important projects.
Slow down now won’t hurt later.
We don't plan to move "double to pursue what's left" as soon as the pandemic passes.
You are not expected to work more time to meet the current unrealistic deadline.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and will strive to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What happened to the APP (Year Plan)?
In order to adapt to the real reality and expectations of our daily working hours, we want to adjust our 2020-2021 Annual Plan delivery timeline.
Our desire to recommend an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgets to allow workers to prioritize critical work, self-care and their beloved care while helping those who need or want to work with reduced work periods for the next few weeks.
The timeline extension greatly reduces the workload and current design pressure throughout the organization.
We will introduce our recommendations to the Board next week and will inform representatives and teams about the next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office status, disclosure and cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our SF colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we have hired antivirus cleaning teams to disinfect all surfaces in San Francisco offices.
They use hospital-grade antivirus solutions to infect every surface as well as lobby and elevator systems that reach our level.
The building adopts its own maintenance task protocol in using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be well available when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which shares the COVID-19 protocol with us and all members of the DC-based staff.
As of last week, our DC office has shifted to far-reaching supplies entirely in line with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some NYC-based co-workers know, we are also talking about one location policy in Brooklyn.
This discussion is ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked remotely for the first time.
Our long-term colleague knows that it can be an adjustment and wants to give you some advice:
Hold the meeting period for an additional one or two hours.
If a longer session is required, consider ways to divide for a few days.
Determine the meeting clearly, have an agenda and send the reading material first.
Make the default video, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Have a chairperson to control each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and track the pronunciation list, and someone helps to take notes (or do a note-taking collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headphone.
Use your health insurance for snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to chat with your colleague about distributed tasks
The HR Operations team is looking at an ergonomic webinar guide to support improvements in tasks distributed throughout the Foundation.
In recent weeks we have asked all community grant recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edits until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We tell them that we understand our request for cancellations and other restrictions may be impossible in preparing their approved grant activities and that no one will be subjected to action due to delays or modifications of those goals.
In the coming week we will make a follow-up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The common sentiment of the entire global community seems to be sadness at distractions but feels relieved at clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and vice versa.
Moving forward, CRT strives to develop a single page about Meta-Wiki to provide space to the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Keeping up with the issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for the coming Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and take some time to connect with each other.
We are together in this and are here to help as much as we can.
For now, you can continue to search for information from this email, and all other important COVID-19-related information on Office Wiki.
CRT will ensure all these pages are updated and all information is in one place.
We also strive to ensure regular communication with staff who are in a highly impressed country at this time.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, or coverage challenges, or whatever help you need, don't hesitate to inform and collaborate with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and become a liaison if necessary.
If you have difficult or sensitive things, please email to Bryan Judan - HR International Director of Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a neglect of our work and responsibilities.
However, all of this is recognition at this time, our work and responsibilities are likely to be tailored in a way that is unlike the past.
These are the steps we believe as necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, provide our movements with the support they need, and the world services they can expect.
Our planned assignment will be there to wait for us when the time comes.
Nowadays, it's time to support each other and create space for important tasks that will arrive in the weeks and possibly the months to come.
We need you all to make it a reality, and we need you all to take care of yourself and your family so that you will be ready at the best level when that need comes.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!

Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that connects to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 faces the activity of the angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE) associated with reducing the number of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a drug that can be expected to be targeted to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as the centre of entry into the cell for some coronaviruses.
The human version for enzymes is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converter enzyme is a zinc containing metaloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelium and other cells.
ACE2 proteins contain the M2 domain of N-terminal peptidase and the domain of the carrier of C-terminal renal amino acids.
ACE2 is a single-way type 1 membrane protein, with its enzyme domain actively exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer domain of the ACE2 cell is attached to the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as the sheddase, and the result of solute proteins is released into the bloodstream and eventually melted into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is twinned on cell membranes of most types II of alveolus cells of the lungs, small intestinal entrocytes, arteries and venous endothelium cells and soft muscle cells of the arteries in most organs.
The expression mRNA ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stems.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a complement to ACE.
ACE binds hormone I angiotensin to the narrowing of vaso angiotensin II.
ACE2 instead attaches phenylalanine amino acid carboxyl-terminal from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and its hydrolysis into the angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Pro-HIle-H)
ACE2 may also attach a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]- bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the distribution of membrane transporting of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is shown in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as a major entry point into cells for some coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COV-19-causing virus).
In particular, binding to the S1 protein papaku for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 on the domain enzyme on ACE2 over the cell surface results in the endocytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomes located between cells.
The entry process also requires the infiltration of S protein by the serin protease of the TMPRSS2 host, inhibitors under current studies as potentially therapeutic. This has led some to the hypothesis that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help in fighting infections.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a large 34<0x25> decrease in pneumonia risk compared to control."
Additionally, "the risk of pneumonia is also reduced for patients treated with ACE inhibitors who have a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality rates, although the results were less steady than the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombination of human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to increase pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen suppression in pigs with affected lipolisaccharide acute respiratory stress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour effect action.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 can be an expected drug for them with intolerances on the inhibitors of the classic renin angiotensin system (RAS) or in diseases surrounding angiotensin II enhanced.
The b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software application designed to help track relationships in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people ("relationship") who may be in contact with infected individuals.
Many applications are developed or proposed with government officials supporting in some areas and jurisdictions.
Some frameworks for building relationships tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy concerns are raised, especially about systems based on geographic location tracking of user applications.
A less disruptive alternative includes the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity logs on other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they will integrate functionality to support applications based on Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has launched an application that allows citizens to check if they have ever had a relationship with those infected with COVID-19.
It is used across over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, launched as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopCorona!", an application based on Bluetooth to track exposure with potentially infected people and provide immediate feedback to health care authorities.
Applications were developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is waiting for approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the relationship tracking app was at an advanced development level, and would be available to launch in a few weeks. A similar application was designed in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand consider applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geolimited applications for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of safety engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential practical problems with an application-based system, including a positive error and potential lack of effectiveness if implementation of applications is limited to only a fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the misleading or dangerous transmission of the coronavirus application, Apple set limits to the type of organization that could add coronavirus-related applications to its Apps Store, limiting them to only "powerful" parties or prominent organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented the same restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed their concerns about the effects of mass surveillance using the coronavirus app, particularly about whether surveillance infrastructure was created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic would be halted as soon as the threat passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement requesting to limit oversight like this.
The organization declares eight conditions on government projects:
(a) the law shall be "in accordance with the law, if necessary, and in proportion";
Further monitoring and monitoring should have a set of clauses;
The use of data shall be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
data security and confidentiality shall be protected and shown as protected by evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid worsening discrimination and marginalization;
any data sharing with third parties shall be defined in the law;
shall be protected against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
meaningful involvement by all "relevant stakeholders" shall be required, including public health experts and marginalized groups. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue checklists.
The Google/Apple plan proposal aims to address ongoing surveillance problems by removing tracking mechanisms from their device's operating system as soon as no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking compared to applications, eliminating both the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, tracking by network is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have a huge potential privacy problem.
However, not all systems with a centralized server need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy maintenance systems are already created that use the server centered only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to conduct relationship tracking.
Compared to using special applications, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and the incorporation of all of these generates notices through text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also makes location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to major changes in information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries including Germany consider using a centralized system and privacy maintenance.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released yet.
Tracking relationships with privacy maintenance is a concept organized with important body study literature starting from 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts work for privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth (BLE) Low Energy for user proximity logs on other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is another coordination effort that contains a centralized and centralized approach, and not a single protocol. The centralized protocols include Centralized Privacy Maintenance Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, Fca Admission Numbers, CEN Protocols),
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all the installations occur on the device.
MIT Media Lab's Privacy Group is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy maintenance techniques when collecting and using location or intersectional data to track the transmission of COVID-19.
This is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar venture is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology development company that was also originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and authorities, without affecting data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by several unified groups on important equally important methods and large overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and empowering global capability for tracking applications and alerts, an important aspect of achieving widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made open source for the BlueTrace protocol used by official government applications.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track relationships that they alleged would maintain privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Power technology and privacy maintenance cryptography.
They also publish the core technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system aims to launch in three stages:
The launch of tools to allow the government to create a privacy-keeping coronavirus tracking application
The integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple's plans to address the ongoing implementation and surveillance issues by first disseminating the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way as the threat passes.
Repositioning the drug (also known as changing the purpose of the drug, re-profile, reassignment or therapeutic conversion) is to change the purpose of a drug approved for the treatment of different diseases or health conditions from the reason it was originally developed.
This is an ongoing scientific research effort to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of the plasma recovery. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 infectious proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analyzing the binding site provides an affordable project to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are proteases such as papain, RNA-dependent polymerase, helixase, S protein and ADP ribofosphatase.

The WHO included melanavir/ritonavir in a Solidarity international trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. The next Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against various philo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
An issue with antivirus treatment is the appointment of resistance through mutations that can lead to worse diseases and transfers.
Some preliminary trials suggest remdesivir may have a high-genetic barrier to resistance. There are several clinical trials being carried out including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate disease and another for those with worse disease.
There are three clinical trials being carried out for intravenous vitamin C for those who are hospitalized and very ill with COVID-19, two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).

The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019).
Although there is no vaccine to complete clinical trials, there are many attempts in progress to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the cause virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase 1's safety study in April.
Covid-19 was identified in December 2019.
Global pandemic transmissions in 2020, providing investments and peer-to-peer research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the imperative of CEPI initiatives for the development of accelerated vaccines, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform aims to advance into Phase I safety studies including:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase 1 development and future vaccines: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vectors (Phase I developers and future vaccines: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vectors)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered as in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials carry out early safety tests and kemunogenesis, usually randomly, controlled placebos and multiple sites, while determining effective doses more accurately.
Stage III trials typically involve more participation including control groups and the effectiveness of tests on vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects on optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as early as April 2020), 74 are still not in human assessment) are still in "practical" investigations.

In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities gathered resources for supercomputer access from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterologist effect, also called a non-specific effect.
This means that they can benefit other than their preventable disease.
A randomized trial in Australia is aimed at enrolling 4,170 healthcare workers.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development are not safe or effective.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, showed the need for 3-level bio safety restraint measures to control live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, no antidote or protective vaccine for SARS has been proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, there is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS is widespread, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine ( DNA-based) that had completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others were running, all of the virus vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Broadcasts on social media encourage conspiracy theories that claim the virus behind COVID-19 have been known and one vaccine is already available.
Patents quoted by various social media broadcasts refer to existing patents for genetic referrals and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of sense of smell and abdomen pain.
The period from exposure to the start of gelajala is usually five days but may start between two and fourteen days.
While most cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and regions, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 patients have recovered. The virus in particular spreads between humans during close contact, often through small droplets produced through cough, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets are produced during breathing, they usually fall to the ground or above the surface rather than being an infection for long distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can stay on the surface for up to 72 hours.
Most infectious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and in the next stage of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by the reaction of a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (cRT-PCR) from the nasofaringeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended to those who suspect themselves to carry viruses and their guards.
The recommendation for the use of masks by ordinary people is different, with some authorities recommend not to use them, some recommend their use and others require their use.
Currently, there are no vaccines or virus treatments specifically for COVID-19.
Local displacement of the disease is recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or show symptoms such as flu such as fever, cough, fatigue and respiratory distress.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and face or bluish lips; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms arise.
Less commonly, upper respiratory gelajas such as sneezing, running nose or throat pain may be observed.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal gastrointestinal disorders such as the taste of ginger, vomiting and diarrhea are observed in the percentage of multiples.
Some cases in China initially only showed data congestion and palpitation.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may be between two to 14 days.
97.5<0x25> of patients who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. The report shows that not all infected show symptoms.
The role of this asymptomatic carrier in the transfer is still unknown; however, early evidence suggests that it may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportions of those infected do not show any unknown symptoms at the moment and are being investigated, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDCC) reporting that 20<0x25> of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic while living in their hospitals.
China's National Health Commission began incorporating asymptomatic cases in their daily cases on 1 April; out of 166 infections on that day, 130 (78<0x25>) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Coconuts and saliva can carry a lot of virus loads.
It's more powerful than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing does not close the mouth can cause droplets to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not innate, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transfers are likely and accumulators of air at positions in the aisle outside the public room show positive samples for viral RNAs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may lead to secretion of respiration into aerosols and so on lead to innate spread.
Although there are concerns it spreads through stools, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is highly contagious when people are asymptomatic; although the spread is possible before the appearance of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) mentions although the whole is unclear about the ease of disease spreads, one infects two to three people in general. The virus lasts for several hours until several days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus is found as detectable for a day over a carton, up to three days over plastic (polipropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours over 99<0x25> of copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly; soap products weaken the protective layer of viral fat, deactivate it and free it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate chlorhexidina (surgical infectious substances) are less effective. In one Hong Kong study, saliva examples were taken to median for two days after the onset of hospital admission.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of SARS-CoV-2 virus novels occur in naturally related coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which leaks its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is almost related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus accesses hose cells through the enzyme exchanger enzyme angiotensin (ACE2), the most abundant in type II alveolus cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a typical surface of glycoprotein called "my newspaper" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the hose cell.
Acute cardium injuries were found in 12<0x25> of people infected who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China and more often in severe diseases.
High levels of cardiovascular symptoms, due to systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disease during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardium injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are very much in the heart and are involved in heart function.
High incidences of thrombosis (31<0x25>) and venous thromboembolism (25<0x25>) were found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to weak prognosis. Autopsy of those who died from COVID-19 has found diffuse alveolus damage (DAD), and lymphocytic inactivation contains inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for epithelial cells of ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic inflammation.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF cells have been shown to correlate with ingestion of monocytes secreting IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphosic aggression was also reported during autopsy.
WHO publishes several testing protocols for diseases.
The standard method of testing is the reaction of the real-time transcription polymerase chain (rPT-PCR).
Tests are usually performed on respiratory samples obtained with nasopharyneal swabs; however, nose swabs or sticky samples may also be used.
The decision is generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks away and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists are able to alienate coronavirus strains and publish genetic references so that labs around the world can freely develop a polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect infections by viruses.
As of April 4, 2020, antibodies (probably detect active infections and whether someone has been infected in the past) are in development but are not widely used.
China's experience with testing has shown accuracy is only 60 to 70<0x25>.
The FDA in the United States approved the first start-up of care on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for infection detection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
The breakdown of bilateral multilobar glasses with periphery, asymmetric and posterior distributions is common during early infections.
Subpleura dominans, many absorptions (septic thickening is bolted with multiple alveolus fillings) and unification may arise when disease progresses.
Some data can be found on monoscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisis, pericarditis, pulmonary pneumonia and edema
Four types of severity for viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytes, hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, space-between inflammation with lymphocytic invasion and multinucleic giant cell formation
severe pneumonia: damage to alveolus diffus (DAD) with exudate alveolus difus.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Rehabilitation of pneumonia: the preparation of exudate in alveolus cavity and space-between pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation is disseminated (DIC), leukoeritroblastic reeis
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, frequently washing hands with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwash hands.
The CDC recommends to close the mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing and recommends the use of the inside of the shoulder if there is no tissue.
Hand hygiene right after any cough or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public places, in part to limit the transfer by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the relationship of people infected with large groups through school closures and workplaces, limit travel and cancel large public gatherings.
The prison guideline also includes for the public being at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from it.
No drugs are identified as effective for preventing COVID-19. Because vaccines are not expected until early 2021, the main thing in managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "blue mapping".
The CDC also recommends that individuals often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty, before eating or after exhaling nose, coughing or sneezing.
It is recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitation with at least 60<0x25> alcohol but only when soap and water are not provided. For areas that do not have commercial hand sanitation, WHO provides two forms for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help get rid of bacterial spores in alcohol; it "is not an active ingredient for hand antisepsis".
Gliserol is added as a moisturizer.
People are managed with support care, which may include liquid therapy, oxygen support, and support other affected important organs.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects themselves to carry the virus to wear an easy face mask.
The absorption of the estrakorporeum membrane (ECMO) is used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its advantages are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatment may be useful for those with mild symptoms at the early stages of the infection. WHO and the Chinese Health Commission have published a recommendation to take care of those hospitalized with COVID-19.
Critical care experts and pulmonologists in the U.S. collect treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there has been no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) compared to ibuprofen for first line use.
precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care settings when implementing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health care professionals looking after those infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends putting the person in the Vaccine Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, relationship precautions and built-in precautions. The CDC provides guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE dresses, respirators or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (compared to face masks) are preferred.
The N95 respirator is approved by industrial settings but the FDA has already allowed masks to be used under the EUA's Emergency Usage Truth.
It is designed to protect against innate particles such as dust but effective against special biological agents is not guaranteed for use outside labels.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face protective or as a final option, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe so require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some percentages require it.
This type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 is associated with respiratory failure being actively studied for patients in hospitals with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-performance nasal canal or two-stage positive airway pressure.
Whether these two benefits the same to people who are critically ill is unknown.
Some doctors choose to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation if it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal kanula. Severe cases are usually frequent in older adults (those over 60 years old and especially those over 80 years old).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle a sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospital admission.
A study in China found that a total of 5<0x25> were admitted to neat care units, 2.3<0x25> needed mechanical support of ventilators and 1.4<0x25> died.
In China, at least 30<0x25> of patients in hospitals with COVID-19 will be admitted to the ICU in the end.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
The ventilator is able to control pressure and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury related to ventilators and pneumothorax.
High PEEPs may not be available on ventilators for longer.
Research for treatment may begin in January 2020, and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears as the most expected.
While new drugs may take up to 2021 to be developed, some of the drug is being tested already approved for other uses already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in people with severe diseases.
WHO recommends volunteers to participate in potential treatment efficacy and safety trials. The FDA provides temporary permission for plasma recovery as an experimental treatment in cases for their serious or easily threatened lives.
It has not yet been through clinical studies necessary to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their names and IDs.
The application can detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and thus the risk of potential infections.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk is potentially detected, the application not only recommends self-quarantine, it also warns local health authorities. The analysis of large data on cellular phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and people they connect in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to trace their mobile phone data to the coronavirus.
Steps are taken to enforce quarantine and protect those associated with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutche Telekom shared data on aggregate phone location with German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implements facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian health commissioner Giulio Gallery said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40<0x25> of the people continue to move around the place".
The German government runs a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid called on the global for a creative solution to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience pressure due to quarantine, travel restrictions, the effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying. "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession is thousands of perfect men's mental health and well-being."
The disease will cause mild effects with little or no symptoms, resembling an ordinary upper respiratory disease such as a common cold.
Light cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness take three or six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be at high risk of getting severe COVID-19 infections based on data from the same viruses as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is less. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In most of those affected badly, COVID-19 can quickly become acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal freezing and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Unnormal freezing, particularly an increase in protrombin times, has been evident in a total of 6<0x25> of those admitted to hospitals with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is observed in 4<0x25> of these groups.
At least 20-30<0x25> of people infected with COVID-19 showed an increase in liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between the start of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent for hospital admission.
However, patients transferred to ICU have a median time of seven days between hospital admission and death.
In an early case study, the median time from the appointment of early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full coverage of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8<0x25> while women with a mortality rate of 1.7<0x25>.
Histopathological examinations in post-mortem lung samples showed the damage of diffuse alveolus with exudate cellular fibromysoids in both the lungs.
Virus cytopathic changes are observed in pneumocytes.
Pictures of the lungs show acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8<0x25> of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was observed with an increase in troponin or cardium levels.
According to March data from the United States, 89<0x25> of those admitted to hospitals with existing health conditions, availability of regional medical and socioeconomic sources may also have an impact on mortality rates.
The estimate of death rates from different circumstances due to their territorial differences, but also due to the difficulty of methodology.
The lower count of mild cases can lead to excessive budget for mortality rates.
However, the fact that death is caused by cases of infection in the past can mean the rate of death during over budget.
Smokers have 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have at least 2.4 more likely to require hygiene care or die than those who do not smoke. Concerns have been voiced about the long-term follow-up of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20<0x25> to 30<0x25> drop in lung capacity in some patients recovering from disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.
This may also lead to Syndrome after careful care according to recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known if the previous infection provides effective and long-term immunity in those recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible, based on other coronavirus behaviors, but in cases with recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by positive tests for the coronavirus on a reported date.
All these cases are believed to be worse with prolonged infections than re-infection.
Viruses are considered natural and are derived from animals, through infections.
The actual origin is unknown, but until December 2019 the transmission of infections as a whole is almost entirely driven through the transfer from man to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest start date of symptoms is December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported the earliest beginning of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
Several steps are usually used to measure mortality rates.
These numbers vary by region and according to time and are affected by the number of tests, quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, periods since early transmission and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
By the end of 2019, WHO set the ICD-10 disease code of U07.1 anxiety for death from laboratory-certified SARS-CoV-2 infections and U07.2 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infections without clinically-diagnosed laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 or epidemiology. The mortality ratio compared to the case reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases that were diagnosed in the case.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality ratio was 6.9<0x25> (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Numbers vary by region. Other measures include the death rate of the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of the person diagnosed dies from the disease, and the death rate of the infection (IFR) that reflects the percentage of the infected person (didiagnosis and not diagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics are not subject to time and follow certain populations from infection to case settlement.
While not everyone develops antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of people infected.
At the outbreak's centre in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7<0x25>) has died.
In Gangelt, disease is spread by Carnival parties, and transmission to younger people, causing lower mortality rates in comparison, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system is not too far away.
In the Netherlands, at least 3<0x25> may have antibodies as assessed by blood donors.
69 (0.004<0x25> of the population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates are different for both men and women.
The higher mortality rate for men in studies was carried out in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is that they are in their 50s, with gaps between men and women perpetuating only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The real reasons for this sex difference are unknown but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
The difference in immunology based on sex, the lack of smoking habits in women and men forms a common morbid state such as hypertension at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57<0x25> of infected individuals are men and 72<0x25> of the total deaths due to COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked sex-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on men and women.
The higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and they have higher exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the abbreviation of CO for the corona, VI for the virus, D for the disease and 19 for the time of the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
Names are chosen to avoid referrals at certain geographical locations (e.g. China), animal species or crowds group, in line with international endorsement for naming aimed at avoiding stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus acute respiration syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the WHO uses the "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus is responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as “coronavirus”.
During early transmissions in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and acute respiration disease 2019-nCoV as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in accordance with 2015 guidelines on location use for diseases and viral names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limitation of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers manufacture health care materials such as nasal swabs and ventilators parts.
In one example, when the Italian hospital needs an immediate ventilator valve, and the supplier cannot send it on the necessary time scale, an engineering beginner turns locally and produces 100 required valves overnight.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation appeared in relation to the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread online quickly.
Humans are able to spread the virus to several other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral imitation in khinzir, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being underway by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization began a "Solidarity Trial" to assess the effects of the treatment of four current antiviral compounds with the most expected effectiveness.
No vaccines are available but various agencies are actively developing candidates for the vaccine.
Previous efforts on SARS-CoV were being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccinations strategies being investigated.
First, researchers are aiming to build a virus vaccine as a whole.
The use of the virus is either inactive or dead, aimed at obtaining immediate immune response to the human body against new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a sensitive vaccine with the immune system on some virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focuses on the papaku S protein that helps the virus invade the receptors of the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Increased antibody dependence is proposed as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is a controversy.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials being carried out as of April 2020.
Seven trials were assessed as treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The purpose-changed antivirus drug covers most Chinese research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivirs for some countries to be reported by the end of April.
A clinical development dynamic review for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is available, as of April 2020. Some of the current antiviral drugs are being assessed for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, petronavir/ritonavir and petronavir/ritonavir join the beta interferon.
There is tentative evidence for effectiveness by remdesivir as of March 2020.
Clinical improvements are observed in patients treated with affectionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials were conducted in the U.S., China and Italy. Chloroquine, used to treat malaria was previously studied in China in February 2020, giving preliminary results.
However, there is a call for a review of the equivalent research.
The Korean and Chinese authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, admits that twice the dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA published the permission of emergency use for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in accordance with the discretion of medical experts to treat those infected with COVID-19. China's 7th edition guideline also includes interferon, ribavirin or yumphenovir for use against COVID-19.
Early data show that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to replenish SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for advanced in vivo studies after showing a reduction in low concentration on SARS-CoV-2. Studies show that the infiltration of protein increases early by transmembrane protease series 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine together or without azithromycin has a major limitation that prevents the medical community from using this therapy without further studies. Oseltamivir does not replenish SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and there is no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can be complications in the next stage for severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has anticytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing an unpredictable phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results with severe disease.
Combined with serum feritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, this meant to fight the development, which is considered the cause of death for some infected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome affected by different causes, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no randomly controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring insulated and concentrated antibodies produced by their immune system that recovers from COVID-19 to people in need are being investigated as a non-vaccinated method for passive immunization.
This strategy was attempted on SARS with no conclusive results.
Neutralization of the virus is a mechanism of future action that passive antibody therapy can be a defense intermediary against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms however, such as cellular cytotoxicity of antibody dependence and/or possibly fagocytosis.
Another form of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclone antibodies produced is in development.
Recovery serum production, consisting of a portion of the blood fluid from recovered patients and containing special antibodies on the virus can be improved for faster execution.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was later infected and died due to COVID-19 after raising awareness of the transmission of the virus.
