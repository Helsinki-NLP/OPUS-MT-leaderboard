Welsh AM Fears 'Looking Like Muppets'
There is a growing fear of some AM in the proposal to replace their title and make MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It was formed by the plan to change the name of the assembly and make it the Welsh Parliament.
People who are afraid of different colors can make fun of themselves.
As an AM from Labour, their group is concerned that "it's the sound of Twp and Pwp."
For readers who are not from Wales: In Welsh, twp and tae mean stupid pwp.
An AM from Plaid said that the group was "not happy" in general and that they thought they could afford to buy.
A Welsh Conservative said his group had "opened the mind" to change the name, but he also said the MWP was not far from the word Muppet.
In this context, the recitation of the letter w in Welsh and letter u in Yorkshire English is similar.
According to the Assembly Commission, which currently proposes the law to change the name: "Any final decision depends on what the Assembly Members will call on its own members."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 at the Welsh assembly granted the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation with proposals that received extensive support that the assembly was called the Welsh Parliament.
In terms of what will be called to the AM, the Commission favored the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP option received the largest support from public consultation.
It also provides possible exchanges for AMs, but the head of Presiding Officer Elin Jones may be able to get all agreed, which is expected to offer a bill in just a few weeks.
The child in the reforms will include other changes in the assembly's running, including the AM's disqualification rules and the design of the committee system.
The final vote is in the AM on what to call them when they make the decision.
Macedonian vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
There will be a vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country and be renamed "Republic of North Macedonia."
This vote will take place in a desire to resolve decades of conflict with their Greek side, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern side means they own its territory and that Athens has repeatedly condemned its request to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's president Gjorge Ivanov, who believes in the plebiscite to change the name, will not respect the vote.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are only in exchange for changing the name of their part of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's <0x51>uiets While Churches Suffer in Harlem
"In the past, I said, there was a bar and a church in every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Now there's nothing."
He said the loss of the bars would be understood.
"The relationship between people today is different," he said.
"People are no longer guilty of bars where people go all the time."
For the churches, he feared that it would not be as long as the leaders expected the money to be available from the sale of properties, "they will soon return where they started."
In addition, it is possible to replace the repairs of apartment buildings with condominiums filled with types of people who cannot help the remaining sanctuaries of the community.
"Most people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said, "so it will only accelerate the day when these churches will be shut down because the people who live in these condominiums will be a member of these churches."
White congregations built the same church before the Harlem-Community Metropolitan metropolis became in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation that worshipped next to the building took its title.
The black congregation encroached St. Martin's under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of predators on 125th Street, a major shopping road in Harlem, which opposed black reception or promotion.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's customers were making plans, they commissioned Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and in exchange for him to St. Martin's, called the carillon "sweeps of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a different one: "A cultural rich" and "an irreplaceable and melodic instrument."
In addition to Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, it was the world's first carillon played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Chruch 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
The event in St. Martin's these last months was a complex story of architects and contractors, where some were entered by the church's undefeated chiefs and others were inducted into the Episcopal diocese.
In July the vestry - the ruler of the parish, consisting of the unintended chiefs - concerned with the concern of "passing the expenses" of the diocese in the vestry, even though the vestry had nothing to do with the acceptance of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some customers complained of a lack of loyalty in part of the diocese.
Thirteen-year-old man who has been in charge of lobsters in California
A shark stormed and hit a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived for a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Ani Chad Hammel on San Diego's KSWB-TV, he had a half-hour dive on Saturday morning with his friends when he heard a boy asking for help and approached him with his group to pull him out of the water.
Ani Hammel, he thought he was just excited about the lobster catch he heard, but "I realized the boy cried out, 'I'm bite!
I've got a bite!"
"He's got a lot of blood," Hammel said as he approached the child.
"I cried out to all who came out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The child was evacuated to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego by a lift where he was listed in critical condition.
It is not certain what type of shark is responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles at a media meeting, there was a dead shark in the area a few weeks ago but it was not identified as a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper part of his body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours to be investigated and for safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams using beauty aisles in the style of department store with specialist assistants.
As an important part of entering the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion sales and luxury markets fall, it will try to get bigger beauty aisles in 11 stores across the country, and will be added next year if it will succeed.
Beauty investment rises as supermarkets are looking for a way to fill shelf spaces previously used for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
Aani Sainsbury's, they doubled the size of their beauty sales by up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current products from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also receive additional branded spaces from stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also again allow its Boutique makeup products to be in favor of vegans - something that is demanded by growing younger consumers.
In addition, Sainsbury's retailer will try to sell two stores of perfumes Fragrance Shop, first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, as the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the coming part of the year.
Online shopping and shopping for a little bit of food every day at local convenience stores has led to supermarkets trying to get people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, will make outlets more attractive as the supermarket chain fights discounters such as Aldi and Lidl with more service and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's put Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also entered several Habitats since they bought the same chain two years ago, which according to them has contributed to the growth of grocery sales and led to the growth of revenue of purchased companies.
The last supermarket attempt to change their beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but it stopped after an argument on how to divide profits from its chemist stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold for <0xC2><0xA3>125m of their pharmacy business with 281 stores in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Lloyds plays a role in the plan by adding products of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's: "We have hidden the look and appearance of our beauty aisle to enhance the environment for our consumers.
We also invest in colleagues with particular training and are willing to give advice.
Designed the entirety of our brands to fill in every need, and the attractive surroundings and convenient locations mean that we are the leading people's destination for enhancement that challenges the primitive way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdrew <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal
Dragons Den starred Peter Jones after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby did not have time for True, their home appliance brand and accessories.
The business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning's Instagram presenter, 37, announced his departure from the business.
Holly Willoughby converted Dragons Den's hero Peter Jones to a sudden retreat from their growing lifestyle brand business - to focus on his bumper contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
According to data sources, Jones was "enraged" when the golden girl of TV admitted at a intensive meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of their giant business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she had no time for True, their <0xC2><0xA3>1 home appliance brand and accessorys, bundling her new agreements.
This business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and has been determined to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While advertised on Willoughby's Instagram, 37, his departure from True, Jones flew out of Britain to go to one of his resorts.
According to one data source: "Right now, True is Holly's top priority.
That would be his long-term future that will lead him over the next decade.
Everyone was shocked by his death.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, but it's still very close.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow H<0x51> ready to be sold."
The company's experts believe the departure of the performer of This Morning, which is one of Britain's most critical personalities, has brought huge investments in products from mattresses and candles to home clothes and equipment, and those that can be delayed by its inauguration.
And it can serve as the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin with three children were ten years close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby started True with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become M<0x26>S's brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
A data-driven close to Jones said "We're not going to comment on his business issues."
We're going to talk about "and then we're friends"
He joked about the criticisms he could receive from the news media for comments that could be "unpresidential" and for being very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump's response to his "news anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June that Trump described as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the discussions of denuclearization have been delayed.
Three months after meeting in June in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea could not see "equivalent action" from the U.S. in what they are doing to cut arms.
Instead, he said, the U.S. would continue to hold tight to keep the divisive.
Trump had a more positive view of his speech at the rally.
"We are in good condition in North Korea," he said.
"We would have fought in North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said his efforts have resulted in positive results in improving ties with Kim - stopping rocket tests, helping to free up hostages, and bringing home the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual way of telling about Kim's relationship with him.
"It's almost as easy as the president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this crowded arena, we have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to people directly in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Landing Island, Road Dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign nonvermental organizations were told that they were not required.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population lost their homes, there was no national emergency, a preliminary condition to encourage foreign aid.
"In many instances, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for help abroad, so it's a bit difficult," Bb. Subuk said.
While the Save the Children make up the team to go to Palu, it is still unclear whether the foreign staff could work in the area.
Ani G. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster bureau, Indonesian officials are still investigating the situation in Palu to see if international bureau will be allowed to participate in the aid.
Despite the earthquake that is often experienced by Indonesia, they are not yet ready for natural disasters.
Although there are tsunami shelters built in Aceh, they are not unusual in other seas.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although there was already a warning, was also likely to be reduced by lives.
At the best times, travel between the islands of Indonesia will be crossed.
Natural disasters are even worsening the logistics.
An optional ship located in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is currently heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days before reaching the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's weakest infrastructure center in his election campaign, and has already provided a lot of money on roads and railways.
Mr. Joko's lack of funding is undermining Mr. Joko's administration for his upcoming re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also faced with dissertation from remaining sectarian rivals in Indonesia, where most Muslims have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands lost their homes while Christian and Muslim groups were fighting on the streets with maches, bows and arrows, and other impoverished weapons.

A police spokesman from Birkenhead confirmed the woman was found and was inside a property.
This morning, friends came to believe they knew the woman to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continued as police said they were informing the incident to close relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was tried to enter his flat but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was silent when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take several hours before they are allowed to enter again.

Cromwell's Revolt of Parliament's latest memorial targeted by conflict on 'history change'
It was incredibly reasonable to remove it due to its taliberal destruction of the large number of British cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "false" and "planning to change history."
Ani John Goldsmith, ruler of the Cromwell Society: "It is inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that will target Oliver Cromwell's image outside the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or perform the destruction of sacred images during the civil wars in England.
Perhaps Cromwell's mistake would have been sacrificing for what his ancestor Thomas had done in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's great creation of Cromwell's opinion of the 19th century and part of the study of the history of a man who many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
G Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more than the 19th century than today, to be the defender of parliament against divinity from the outside, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
The historical debate is still in effect if it is an accurate description in general.
It is only certain that the rivalry in the middle of the 17th century shaped the next formation of our country, and that Cromwell was a unique figure representing an aspect of that cowardice.
It is also worth celebrating and remembering those who have succeeded as Lord Protector."
A man who kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by pork in the market in southwestern China, according to reports by local media.
The man, known only for his surname "Yuan," who is dead and has a severed artery, was found lying near a pig cage in a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pork keeper is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a borough on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining in <0x51>inghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from a nearby Yunnan potency on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he discovered an open door in a nearby pig cage.
He said there was a large pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirms that 550 pounds of pork has been consumed by farmers, according to the report.
"I've got my hair cut and broken," his cousin, who is known only for his nickname "Wu," in Guiyang Evening News.
Yuan's video of the security camera saw Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
Yuan or his cousin did not own the animal that killed the man.
Ani a market ruler in the Evening News, detained the pig so that it could no longer be attacked, while police gathered evidence at the site.
According to the report, there was a negotiation between Yuan's family and market authorities for payment on his death.
Although rare, there have been cases previously recorded by pigs that attack people.
In 2016, a pig attacked the woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical male injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig applied to the Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife feared to keep the animal away.
After his pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but may serve as a "pulling" to them the taste of blood.
"They're just playing.
They want to be overweight, they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa will bring extensive and rapid rainfall to the southwestern U.S.
As it has been reported, Hurricane Rosa is declining as it goes into the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding and rain throughout northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa has a speed of 85 mph, a Category 1 Hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and it is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a thriving trough over the Pacific Ocean and it moves eastward to the U.S. West Coast as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical humid northwards towards the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical humidity will then make it toll on the upcoming trough of wide and heavy rainfall in the Southwest in the coming days.
In the locality, causing dangerous flooding, debris flow, and desert landslides 1 to 4 inches of rain.
The deep tropical moisture will cause a repetition of about 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Approximately 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected in the Southwest, especially in large parts of Arizona.
An outbreak of flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions is possible due to the volatile nature of tropical rainfall.
It's not good to go out and walk through the desert with a threat of tropical rainfall.
Canyons can be flooded rivers due to heavy rains, and storms with thunderstorms of local strong winds and duststorms can cause flooding.
Local heavy rains will bring near depression in some parts of the South California coast.
It is possible to reduce the blockage to a total of more than half an inch, which can lead to a slight flow of debris and damp roads.
It will be the first rainfall in the region during its rainy season.
It will begin approaching Arizona on the evening of Sunday and Monday mornings with some scattered tropical rainfall, before the rainfall spread on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
Heavy rainfall is spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools down, in October extreme temperature changes across the U.S., while the tropics remain relatively warm.
Sometimes, it causes extreme temperature changes in close distances.
There is a good example of strong differences in temperatures throughout the U.S. on Sunday.
There are about 20-degree temperature differences between Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will be tested to grow and expand again.
It is expected to have a hot start in October with the vast 80s of the middle and eastern U.S., from the Southern Plains to some parts of the North East.
New York may reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be higher than 10 degrees in practice.
Our long-term weather report claims a high probability of higher than average temperatures for the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people have watched the silent testimony on Thursday of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of sexual assault that occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political fight continued, with broadcasters delaying the regular program for Friday's final blast: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long investigation of cases by the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that 100 percent of him was sure that Kavanaugh had taken him drunk and tried to strip him at a high school party.
In a warm testimony, Kavanaugh said that 100 percent of him was sure that didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers did not immediately become available for other networks that released them, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has a problem with the number of people watching offices.
To be clearer, it is equivalent to the number of spectators of the playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel led the networks, where opinion hosts strongly support Kavanaugh's dedication, with approximately 5.69 million viewers throughout the day listening, Nielsen said.
ABC's second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 1.3 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen says.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a major figure in the drama on Friday.
After the press release of the moderate Republican office, Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS found him home on Friday morning that protesters were screaming while riding the elevator to a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood down his eyes as he insulted him for a few minutes, and released it live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He said, "You have power while many women have no power."
Before the elevator closed, Flake said that his office had issued a statement, which at the hearing of the committee he would say more.
It is reported that it will be live hours after all cables and broadcast networks, while the Judiciary Committee must be voted to advance Kavanaugh's nomination throughout the Senate to vote on it.
But Flake said he would only do this because his understanding is that the FBI will investigate allegations against the nominee next week, which minority Democrats have been pushing for.
Flake was slightly convinced of his friend's conversations, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and many other senators, Flake formed a pass.
Flake's legislature has power, as Republican votes clearly do not come to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accused critics of 'political' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politics" in Britain's future and undermine the country's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.

The department praised the Louisiana State Police Fugitive task force, the crime lab of the state police, the Southern University police and local citizens in assisting the investigation driven into the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law disciples for its "trying and seeking justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.

"That's what you always remember," Wade said.
A volcano in Mexico City
Homes to the south of Mexico's capital reached the flower drained by the Popocatepetl volcano.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to withdraw from the volcano after crater activity rose and registered 183 air and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center monitors a lot of dizziness and vibration.
The images on social media show thin ash covering car windshields in areas of Mexico city such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) away from the southeast of the capital after a 7.1-mile collision in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano has been known as "Don Goyo" since 1994.
Police clashed with separatists in Catalan before the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashing with pro-independence protesters at the terror police, and as thousands joined the opposition's motion to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's bitter vote on the discovery.
The egg and powder paint of a group of pro-separatists masked policemen who stopped them, and made black dust clouds on streets that were usually crowded with tourists.
In the evening, police also took control of the fighting.
Pro-independence groups have called "No forgetting, no forgiveness" before unionists protesting shouting, "Spain Lives."
Fourteen people were treated for minor wounds obtained in the protests, local newspaper reports.
Tensions remained high in the region calling for independence after a referendum year on October 1 which Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters chose to self-determine although few voted because most of the polls voted out in opposition to the discovery.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in precincts across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent action supporting the national police.
The move continued, but was forced to go on another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer relied on the possibility of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year, we had one of our greatest moments.
"I've seen my parents cry because they're going to vote, but we're not going to go down," he said.
Despite achieving success in the regional election last December, pro-independence parties in the Catalan bumblelo this year have found it difficult because of the self-exile or detention and waiting for the hearing of many of their famous leaders due to their role in organizing the referendum and the declaration of independence.
Ani Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records her phone of a protest supporting police, which politicians of both sides fueled the rivalry.
"It's just getting better," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders in Catalan who have been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he will run in the European Parliament election next year.
"Being a candidate in the European election is the best way to denounce the withdrawal of democratic principles and control we have seen from the government of Spain," he said.

It may also seem that at some point there is a crossbow that has been thrown into the car.
Menga's Tira, Winning Livingston against the Rangers, 1-0
Dolly Mengga's first goal ensures Livingston's success
Livingston reported the Rangers to give Steven Gerrard his second win in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's tira was needed to equal Gary Holt's Hiberian team in the second.
Gerrard's team remain unbeaten in the Premiership this season and they will face the top Hearts rankings that will catch them eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers would fight Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their unbeaten division play in six games, along with head coach Holt who had not lost since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost a chance against Brush Visitors
Holt's team had to take a long lead before they scored, otherwise because of their directness causing problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson was able to escape, but tried to make a goal, and Alan Lithgow's tides moved away because he was met by Craig Halkett's header.
Hostess are happy to play the Rangers in front of them, because they know they can torture the visitors at the scheduled points.
This is how the important goal came.
The Rangers gave up a free-kick and got Livingston the chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to help Menga, who scored the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
At that point, the Rangers had already gotten the ball but they had difficulty getting into the defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty,
This play continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had to force a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was intercepted by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow lived away from another set play of Livingston.
Movings to Livingston's side continued and also continued to be driven, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to substitution Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were ignored.
"Wonderful" from Livingston - Review
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Wonderful play and results for Livingston.
With a person, they are good, they continue to meet expectations of increased growth.
Their style of play and character has not changed almost since they've been the best ever, but it's a great compliment to go to Holt with his motivation for the team since his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was good, leading the organized defense, as Menga tortured Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the match.
The Rangers, however, were not inspired.
Whatever they came from under Gerrard, they didn't reach those standards.
Their last ball failed - they only opened their side once - and it seemed like a call to the Rangers, finding themselves in the middle of the rank.
Erdogan's reaction to Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to resolve the relationship between NATO allies.
They argued on human rights issues, freedom of press, and Turkey's climb to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
It is the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have called for security to block 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurdish - denounced Erdogan's policies and the German government's pact to accept him in the country.
Two different protests undermine the disparate visitor who is considered the hero of some German Turks and criticised as the dictatorship of others.
Deptford road: A cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died after a car crashed in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, nearly a mile away from the collision on Saturday.
Police say they are working on identifying the man and saying goodbye to his relative.
There are places to close the roads and different roads of buses and inform motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officials were wounded in a riot in the men's high security detention center, the Prison Office said.
The HMP Long Lartin riot began in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and it is currently ongoing.
The "Tornado" specialists were sent official to deal with the riot, carrying eight prisoners and keeping them in a wing.
Officials were embroiled in the scene for minor facial injuries.
The Prison Service spokesman said: "There have been dispatched specially trained personnel to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not allow violence to be confined to our precincts, and we clarify that the respondents will be subjected to police and could be detained for longer."
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, along with the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the precinct management was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, riot officers were called in the cage to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens sudden Flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Sweet Places Can Benefit)
It is rare for Arizona to hit tropical depression, but that could happen in the early part of next week due to the passage of the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa in the Desert Southwest, bringing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued emergency monitoring for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, along with the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The Rose storm is expected to pass directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will be approaching Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical storms have maintained a tropical storm or depression state 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest Hurricane Center models estimate 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with dozens of volumes up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
The rest of the Desert Southwest is likely to get 1 to 2 inches including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, possibly with a ten-pound total of up to 4 inches.
For those who are not in danger of sudden flooding, Rose's rain can be a blessing because of the drought of the region.
While it is very important to remember the flooding, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 40 percent of Arizona suffer from severe droughts, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa first went to landfall on the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Still with hurricane strength and the fastest winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, the Rosa storm is 385 miles away south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, going north at a rate of 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific and will eventually weaken.
So it is expected to land in Mexico with the strength of the tropical storm of the afternoon or Monday evening.
Rainfall can be strong in parts of Mexico, bringing the great danger of flooding.
"We expect a total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall in Baja California to the northwestern Sonora, which is likely to reach 10 inches," weather.com reported.
The Rosa storm will then go to Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona to southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected in Rosa or its remains is very strong rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and in the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flooding and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in dense areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four, arrested in attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in a suspected attempted murder, after a 16-year-old with stabs in Somerset was found.
A young man was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials have asked anyone who has a photo of what's happening on the phone.
"It's hard for Kavanaugh to 'defense, out of anger' by the Democratic Party," Trump said
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to dismiss the Democratic Party's harsh and violent tactics," Trump said at a gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "hardened" by the Democratic Party in the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, forcing and emotionally denying the accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that he had blamed it decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to the hearing of his accusation.
The President said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's origin and quality and courage" that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most effective brains in the law of our time, a jurist with a machine history of public service," he said at a rally of supporters in West Virginia.
The President cited Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the amount of Republican voting in the midterm election.
"It's just five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not going to run, but I'm really going to run," he said.
"Wherever I am, there are good candidates."
Trump said the Democrats' mission was to "fight and prevent."
The Senate's first major procedural vote in Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be carried out by no more than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, as, expected to rise
Approximately 384 people were killed, most of them were swept away by massive waves on the beach, when the Indonesian island Sulawesi sank and drowned, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves hit the beach six metres (18 feet) in the twilight, with the majority of their deaths and destroyed all of its streets.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still carrying out activities on the beach and did not immediately leave and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, Indonesia's disaster prevention agency spokesman, BNPB, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"It didn't pass without the tsunami, it dragged cars, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami touched the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
"Some of the trees jumped to escape the tsunami and survived," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial images showed that the disaster agency released many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the city on the beach on Saturday.
2.4 million people have felt a series of earthquakes.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technolog, BPPT, said that the energy released by a major earthquake on Friday was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that stopped in Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, positioned at the end of the long and narrow bay, may have been boosted by the tsunami power, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "large" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, markets, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of other victims were seen to be pressed under collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said Casualty and damage could be higher along the 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "to the whole was cut without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are going to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The agency's criticism was wide open on Saturday because they did not respond to a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of warning.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man was shown on the upper floor of a building shouting fears that the imminent tsunami warning people on the road below.
In a few minutes, a water wall hit the beach, causing buildings and cars to stand out.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive power losses that disrupted communications around Palu, and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but food refugees and other basic needs were still needed.
The city's airport has just opened for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center of Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia has risen to 800.
It's very well known.
As World Vision staff from Dongga reached the city of Palu safely, where employees remained in shelters built on the grounds of their ambush, they saw scenes of road damage, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's so bad.
Even though aid groups have already begun to start aggravating disaster relief, some complain that foreign aid workers who have strong skills to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funding, equipment, and personnel from other countries can only begin arriving if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This disaster is only at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government has said that, "O.K., it's a national disaster," we will be open with the help of other countries but there's no situation at this time."
By the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those who have lost their loved ones will continue to hope for the miracles that will impress the tragic stories of national disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers were able to remove a woman who was stuck under the rubble when her mother's body was two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, the trainer of Indonesia's national paragliding team, coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that finished in the first part of this month in Indonesia.
Some of the stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As older people in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon acknowledged that, in the hours after the paragliding community spread the Roa Roa Hotel collapse news, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu players, who participated in the beach celebration.
But his messages only resulted in a color check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.
"I think the messages were not sent," he said.

Kanye West: The rapper will change his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will change his name - in Ye.
On Twitter's announcement of a change on Saturday, he wrote: "The former recognized Kanye West."
Ye has long been nicknamed West, 41, and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was preceded by his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He would replace the show with singer Ariana Grande who canceled for "emotional reasons," said the maker of the show.
With the exception of the pronunciation of his current professional name, West used to say that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, 'you' mean it," West said in the early part of this year in discussing the title of his album on radio host Big Boy.
If so, I'm you, I'm you, it's us.
From Kanye, which means alone, to being Ye alone - to be just a mirror of our good, our evil, our confusion, all.
The album makes us more aware of who we are."
He was one of the few famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known for various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced the love of the names Love and Brother Love.
Congratulations on having or without gitling and big characters in the name once collaborating with West's JAY-Z.
Mexico's AMLO pledges to not use the military against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that the military will never use force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday promised to "never use the military to control Mexican citizens."
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on Oct. 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at the time of the student's leftist movements across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican children by providing monthly aid to students and opening more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of opportunities for education would expose youth to criminal groups.
U.S. should double the funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field," said AI's investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
Comments have been made after ads about AI made various parts of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. lacks formal AI strategy as a whole.
China, meanwhile, introduced its plan last year: it intends to become No.1 in AI change by 2030.
"It's a good start to double the AI's research budget, as the U.S. is very much left to all other countries, and we are looking for the next success of the AI," Lee said.
Double-double funding chances in the U.S. will make the next major AI victory," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovacation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face<0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worried about an AI system that defeated the best American player of Otherllo, and then, he became an apprentice at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when to take place the next contest, to help identify future visionaries.
Often, researchers in the U.S. need to work hard to get help from the government," Lee said.
"China is not taking the top academics; otherwise the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other luminaries technology companies have been recruiting from universities to work with AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy would help the U.S. to strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to those with a PhD in AI," he said.
China's State Council published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people and academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations funded researchers from the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In the first part of this year, the U.S. Defense Department established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to consider partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
About NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law has not seen any action seeking to make a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence in a few months.
Macedonians voted to change the country's name in a referendum
The people of Macedonia voted to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" in a referendum on Sunday, an action that could fix the decades-long conflict between Greece that blocked its desire to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, has asserted that its territorial claim indicates the name of its neighbouring northern country and has rejected the entry of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed with the proposed new name in June, but nationalists argued that the change would undermine the Slavic ethnic identity of the Macedonian major population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and caused the boycott campaign to doubt whether the turnout reached the 50 percent minimum requirement for the referendum to be valid.
This is the stated question on the ballot in the referendum: "Are you in favor of being a member of NATO and the EU along with accepting the treaty with Greece."
Supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is worth the desire to enter groups such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that have fled from the Yugoslav collapse.
"I'm going today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union because it means that life is safer for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Even though the law did not cover, enough members of parliament said they would follow the result of the vote to confirm it.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state commission said there were no reports of irregularity by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent of the previous parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I vote because of my children, we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voters in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko voted for Macedonia's referendum on changing the country's name to open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and suspects seats in front of tents arranged by bobo-boycotts in the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join high-noo and not enter the door of the allies," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a tough country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and be part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring the most needed investment in Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the big majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens favor the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that the "yes" result will be "proof of our future" the "yes" result.
A vote published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - low in the required turnout.
Another poll by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they were "yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and then a vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the Western government's policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero, slammed Brighton's full defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling scored Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the game easy on his points in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the series.
He ran between the three Brighton defenders, before batting in the open field.
Then, Aguero sees herself surrounded by four green clothes.
He forced a defender ahead of running a few more at the end of the Brighton box.
Then he turned to his left and found Sterling.
English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan a tira on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is having problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were fortunate to have achieved that goal at the time."
Sterling, however, gave the Sky Blues the opening advantage in the Premier League.
That goal entered in the 29th minute.
Aguero accepted the ball while deep in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a good through ball along the left flanks to Leroy Sane.
She did a lot of work before taking Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward pinned the ball into the net before sliding out the border.
City will fight Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:45 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play as a spoiler vs. Rockies
When the Nationals withdrew from the playoffs, there was no reason to push another start.
But regular fighter Scherzer hopes to get the position on Sunday in the match against the Colorado Rockies, but that is if the Rockies still have playoff implications with a game of prominence against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
In any case, the Rockies scored a wild-card position with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but still hopefully their first division title is secure.
"Even if we're playing for the left, we can hit the mountain, at least, knowing that feeling here in Denver, along with the people and the other team, is likely the highest level of any point I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to fight there?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they are claiming that Scherzer will be allowed to pinch in such a situation.
Scherzer held a bullpen session on Thursday to make his 34th start, and to pinch on his usual rest day on Sunday.
Washington right-hander was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump, Rally in West Virginia
The President did not explicitly define the situation that enshrined his choice for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done in November.
It's just five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running so I'm scared of fighting good candidates," he said.
Trump added, "You see this terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening today.
And they are determined to withdraw power by any means necessary, you see the generality, the greed.
They don't care who they hurt, who they should beat to achieve their power and control, power and control, and we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, had a mission of "commontra and obstruction."
"And you see that in the last four days," he said, while calling the Democrats "angry and angry and outrageous and destructive and lying."
He mentions the name of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received strong candidacies from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you release the document?
Ah, ah, what.
"No, no, no, I've been waiting for one - that's a very bad body language - the most beautiful body language I've ever seen."
Labour, no longer a broad church.
They don't accept those who think they're
When the activists of the momentum voted in my local party to protest me, it was no longer a surprise.
If so, I'm the last in line of Labour MPs who said we weren't accepted - all because of the revelation of our thoughts.
My partner in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because he stood strong against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the petition of the censorship criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
With the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, that in irony are similar issues where Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
A reminder for the Nottingham East Labor meeting on Friday announced that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, GC meetings are like that every Friday night.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and has long forgotten the promise of "more understandable, gentler" politics, if it really started ever.
It has become more remarkable that opposing views on the Labour party are not allowed and judge each opinion on whether it is acceptable to those who are above the party.
It started as soon as Jeremy became chief, as colleagues first began to rely on me that there was a similar political view to me that I turned down and took positions that I never agreed to - whether in the national security or in the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in front of the public - and it doesn't matter what I'm going to say - there's the next tyranny of social media abuse calling a dissertation, criticizing the politics of the digit, and saying I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that's not all my experience.
Indeed, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed to me are politically inclined.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the rising abuse of sexist or racist daily but never retreated.
One of the most disconcerting aspects of politics at this time is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour party should cultivate the culture of acceptance.
Reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every petition of "confidence" or change of election policies, the party becomes narrower.
I've received a lot of advice over the past two years that I've encouraged myself to bow down, not to talk too much, and then, "I'll be fine".
However, that's not what I wanted to do in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, aroused by Thatcher's government's negligence that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally collapsed, I tried to promote better public services for more needy people - as local councillors or government ministers.
I've never kept my politics hidden, including in the previous election.
No one in Nottingham East can be confused in any way about the positions of my policy and places of disapproval of the current leadership.
To those who advanced Friday's petition, all I wanted to say was, when the country broke into a Brexit that would damage our homes, livelihoods, and public services, I didn't understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour party's leader.
But, in fact, a message I have is not in Nottingham Momentum, if not in my bodies, whether a member of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and promise that there is no number of threat of desecration or political expediency that will stop me from acting in whatever I think is best for you all.
MP for Nottingham East Chris Leslie
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The non-stop Ayr
The last two tests have missed the final, but Ayr undoubtedly deserves to win the amazing and entertaining match of the Tennent Premiership day.
They are now at the top of the table, the unique non-stop side of the ten.
Ultimately, their unique defense, like their better take chances, brought home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've tried our games so far, and we're still not losing, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Beautiful with Ayr, they're better off going out than we are."
Grant Anderson's try put in the 14th minute, with Frazier Climo, the Ayr in the front, but a yellow card for the Scottish cap Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors game, gave Melrose permission to score and scored an unconverted Jason Bagtry.
Climo missed Ayr's lead in a penalty shootout, before, right half-time, he scored and converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and was reduced by Patrick Anderson's attempt, with Baggot converting only five points.
Subsequently, there was a long delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, released by the stutterer, and from the restart, Ayr would strike forward by Stafford McDowall's attempt to convert Climo.
Yellow card was given the standing Ayr captain Blair Macpherson, and again, the Melrose allowed the additional man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of the quest of fierce force.
However, the home side came back and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to tackle Climo without a ball, and from the penalty line-out, MacPherson knocked down behind forward Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did almost from restarting, after Kyle Rowe kicked David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregory Henry away for the fifth try of the home side.
Still Game Bida, seems to be ready for a new career in the food industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to move to the hospitality industry, after discovering that he is named director of a licensed food company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis performs as Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, which he wrote and starred along with his long-term comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the end of the show's run, and it would appear that Kiernan was planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the official list, he was director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun's reporter indicated that Kiernan seemed to want to be part of Glasgow's "growing restaurant trade".
"On the sea": landlocked Bolivia, hoping to reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling a naval base wrapping rigging in La Paz.
The public buildings are flying a sea-like flag.
The sea wetlands from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon said: "The sea is for us according to law.
It is a duty to reclaim it."
Throughout Bolivia's landlocked landlocked, it is still clear that the memory of a coastal lost by the defeat of Chile in a bloody feud with the naturalities of the 19th century - such as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
Those wishes were at the highest level perhaps for several decades, as Bolivia waited for the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has a bowel, a sense of solidarity, and security, and it is hopeful, of course, with a positive view of the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, full of hope that the tribunal in The Hague will divert Bolivia's request that - after decades of bizarre dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate giving Bolivia free access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who faces a controversial match for next year's re-election - also has many things on Monday's decision.
"We will soon return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court's chances of making a decision in favor of Bolivia are small - and small will change if this happens.
The Netherlands-based UN board has no power to produce Chilean territory, and it has agreed that it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The case was "not complicated" based on the arrival of the ICJ's decision in just six months after the hearing of final arguments, said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in global law.
And far from the progress of Bolivia's fighting, it may have been prevented by the last four years.
"Bolivia's current administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric weakened any remaining goodwill of the Chileans, he suggested.
At one point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, who was represented by Bolivia in The Hague, denied the idea that the court's decision rate was unusual.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to open up a new era of relations in Chile" and a chance to "end 139 people who are incomprehensible when both sides benefit," he said.
Calzadilla has also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - is the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea said nuclear disarmament (nuclear disarmament) would not happen unless it could trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disseminate its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to continue promises made during a summit in Singapore between the heads of rival countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to have resumed his nuclear diplomat following a summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un more than three months ago.
Ri said North Korea was "deeply dreamed" to respect North Korea by continuing to impose U.S. sanctions and opposition in a declaration ending in the Korean War.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without taking important measures to reduce Pyongyang's weapons.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are both expecting a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the lifting of weapons that the country is likely to see him as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of large headwear that is about to be released on a High Street near you
If you want to raise your hat collection or cover the sun, don't look for someone else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have released a range of unusually large-headed costumes for their SS19 collection on the runway so the style set at Paris Fashion Week is amazing.
This summer, there's a lot of unpractical hats on Instagram and these designers have brought their catch-and-seek creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's insulated pie is a truly unique beige hat decorated with a broad bird's appalling brim that surrounds the heads of models.
Other large ornaments include bright waterfalls, a wizard hat and also a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head off.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of odd masks that were right for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have lipsticks and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
There is a creation similar to scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, while there is another cone of melted ice cream.
And if you continue this great fashion statement, you're lucky.
Look for style watchers, big bonnets are about to be released on high streets near you.
The arrival of the growing hat was time after the 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a brim of two feet and was seen wearing everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The clutch label behind the overpractical hat that was spread on social media sent back another great creation to the catwalk - a beach bag made of straw almost the size of the swimsuit model holding it.
The color burn orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringing and accompanied by a white leather handle, is the exclusive piece at Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I look forward to seeing the arrival of big hats and beach bags on the high street next summer – because of the size of the designer’s impression, it’s hard to ignore the demand for big accessories.'
John Edward: Language Skills that are important to the world's citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain the track record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with the help of another board of excellent exam results, which was only boosted by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to its students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for additional and higher education, their chosen career and place as a world citizen.
As an educational sector that designes and implements the school's corresponding curriculum, we see modern languages continuing as popular and preferred topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone with the language he understands, it will get into his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it will enter his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we should not only rely on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exam, we will see that language is leading in league tables with the highest rate of passing independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages gained a higher grade A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students gained a higher A mark in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also got A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland sport foreign languages as essential skills that youth will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today, as the subject of choice, are considered to be equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, it was found that on the grounds that employers provided for poverty to fill vacant positions, 17 percent were due to a lack of language ability.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in order for young people to be prepared for their future careers.
At the same time as the increase in potential employment opportunities that require knowledge of language, these abilities are important in a globalized world.
Whatever a person's chosen career, if he learns a second language, he will have a future advantage due to having a lifelong ability like this.
People who speak multiple languages will automatically have the advantage because of their ability to communicate directly with people from other countries.
In 2013, according to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were inadequate to speak in foreign languages and only French was spoken in a two-digit percentage, which was 15 percent.
This is why it is important for today's youth to put investment in language teaching.
Having competence in many languages, particularly in developing economies, will give young people a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, schools are different when it comes to the languages they teach.
Many schools will be taught in more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when applied in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there is always a language choice in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools focus on providing an educational environment that prepares young people and will give them the ability necessary to succeed, regardless of what will happen in their future.
It is undeniable at this time, in the area of global business, that language knowledge remains important for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Undoubtedly, modern languages should be regarded as "competitive in global interactions."
Independent schools continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence for young Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be playing for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans are waiting to see LeBron James' start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the preseason opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It's longer than a minute but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to have limited minutes to play.
Following the rehearsal in the first part of the week, James was asked about his plans for six games on the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need any preseason games at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump will start a campaign rally this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, including visiting allies such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote waits for confirmation for his choice to fill in the vacant position in the Supreme Court, Trump's goal is to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally scheduled at 7 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address hearings this week for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been stressed over allegations of embassies at the same time holding the expected vote of Senate confirmation for up to a week while investigating the FBI.
However, the main goal of these rallies is to help Republicans get momentum in the big elections in November.
President Trump's campaign, therefore, said that these five rallies next week are focused on "acting volunteers and supporters as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their holdings in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control in Congress is very important for his agenda to go to the president in as many states as possible as we are going to the busy time of campaigning," said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named.
The rally is scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight and can deliver supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and get reports from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday it would be the second time in last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate for West Virginia Republican senator Patrick Morrsey, who is caught on the ballot.
"It's not a good sign for Morrsey to have the president go to try to strengthen him on the ballot," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown courage to keep hope for Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday afternoon's foursomes might need this Ryder Cup.
A fully invented concept in the field of sports is the "swinging pendulum of momentum" but players believe it, especially in competitions like this.
So, what do you think is the momentum now?
"They have only six points, and now only four, so we probably have a little momentum," Jordan Spieth said as he left.
In Europe, of course, only four points and twelve more remain.
The Americans, Speith said, they had a little bit of weight and were brave, when Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day and had three points out of four.
Spieth led his side and devoted him from the tee to the green.
The celebration's screams grew stronger as the round lasted, he got an important putt in to make the four match board after being two down after two with Thomas.
There was a similar shout that won them in the match at 15, the type of shout that says the fight is not over for the American side.
"You just have to take a break and think about yourself," Spencer said.
That's all that's left for every player.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players to score higher than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup's undisputed story.
Four out of four and nothing can make a difference but wonderful pairs from Europe.
"Molliwood" is the only pair who did not live in bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
That bug, and how it looks like their energy flows from and to the noisy viewer is proof that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and no more famous player can determine the win for Europeans at Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
If it were possible, it would be in different holes.
However, it seems that the issue of European victories is early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when they made them equalised by Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine embedded in Spaniard and Swede, and they were no longer able to get up.
But on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
It's comforting to watch fourballs and foursomes close due to interactions between pairs, the advice they give and don't give, and the possible sudden change of strategy.
Europe's game is better as a group today and they're heading to the final day but this foursome session showed the strength and strength of Team USA that some, especially Stateside, have doubted.
Europe scored 10-6 in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will only be strong on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out on Saturday from fourballs and foursome matches with only 10-6 matches against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molini led two wins against the struggling Tiger Woods to bring their tally to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side that included Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to retrieve the trophy they had lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated against the American side who took part in the morning fourballs, and won the series 3-1.
The United States fought more than foursomes, and won two matches but could not lower the odds.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four consecutive points as he and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after a very good weekend, the second pair only to have won four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After Woods and Patrick Reed finished with fourballs, they were impressed by the force to defeat dismayed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechmbeau at 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who dragged himself in two matches on Saturday, showed short-term surges of well-being but had already received a defeat in 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose took a break for fourballs in the morning, and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to defeat 2<0x26>1 with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who were in the world's first and third rankings.
The weather was not good for Europe even though the weather in the south-western part of Paris was bright and warm.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans after scoring two points on Saturday.
They earned a keen 2<0x26>1 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourballs and returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4<0x26>3 in foursomes after losing in the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team returned from a four-point deficit to enter the singles, but as holders only needed Furyk's side a draw to keep the trophy.
After two days of being second in position, it seems that they can't afford a counter-attack on Sunday.
"North Korea says 'no' unilaterally to disseminate without trust"
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that their suspicions in the United States have deepened because of ongoing sanctions and the country will never unilaterally give up their nuclear weapons under this situation.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly of representatives of the world that North Korea has taken "essential measures with good intent" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, cutting off nuclear test sites, and promising not to make nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we have not seen a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under this situation we will not be unilaterally disseminated."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's refusal to a "suggestion" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea was honored as it was taking small steps, his statement seemed important as it did not immediately reject the unilateral denuclearization as the Pyongyang did.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current President of the United States and head of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" as Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's safety.
North Korea has long been seeking a formal end in the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first surrender their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected requests to reduce tight international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States is struggling to denuclearize" and raises the weight of sanctions to achieve their objectives in a violent manner, and they also oppose "declaration at the end of the war," Ri said.
"The view that sanctions will undermine us is a deep dream of people who don't know about us.
However, the problem is that we continue to be underestimated."
Ri did not have any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the head of the United States announced to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister announced three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea and not the United States are the party on this issue of disarmament of nuclear weapons, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not lead to a deadlock."
However, Ri's tone from last year's speech was completely different, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting North Korea's rockets territory could not be avoided after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on the suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year that he would "really crush" North Korea, rained Kim's praises for his bravery in taking steps to disarmament, but said that there was still much to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea's denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for it, and also said, "If it lasts two years, three years or five months - no case."
China and Russia have called for Pyongyang to be honored by the U.N. Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Security Council sanctions should continue rigorously and without a minute until we fully know about the event, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has jointly strained North Korea's sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said after visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July, and said that there had been a launch, just for North Korea to blame him for making "serious demands."
North Korea has pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to destroy a Missle site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States has taken "equivalent measures" on its part.
He said Kim mentioned to him the "equivalent measures" he was looking for are security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the way to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students, taking a course on having enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University helps its undergraduates to sleep well as an attempt to combat the macho culture of study throughout the night while being activated by caffeine.
An academic learned that students at number one university in the world often don't know about the most basic ways to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, teacher of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed to be the earliest of its kind in the United States.
He had the inspiration to start the course after giving the issue of the effect of sleeplessness in the study.
“After that, a woman came to me and said: ‘Why did this ever tell me, in my senior year?’
He said no one told him about the amount of sleep - which I was surprised," he told The Telegraph.
The course was released for the first time this year that explains students the importance of having a healthy sleep behavior and how it contributes to academic and athletic activity, as well as overall health.
Paul Barreira, teacher of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to enter the course after learning that students were very short of sleep a week.
An hourly course includes a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is a picture of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to tell about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athleticism, and the importance of a routine for sleep.
In another section, participants are told how sleep loss increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
There is a campus map, with interactive icons, which encourage participants to think about their daily activities.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - like you have the right to know the health effects of smoking," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of having an ‘all-nighter' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are raising the problem of sleep deprivation.
ensuring that you have enough sleep, with good quality, should serve as the ‘secret weapon' of students to fight stress, intense fatigue and anxiety, he said - to also prevent weight gain, because sleep deficits put the brain in the state of hunger, so they become hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking a class of him in his first year at Harvard.
He said that his eyes were opened and that he had an inspiration to pursue a schooling course.
He hopes that the next step will be asked students to complete a study program similar to this before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students think about setting an alarm when to sleep and wake up, and to find out the adverse effects of ‘blue light' that have been used by electronic screens and LED lights, which can destroy circadian rhythms, and cause problems
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocked down Gerrard's team
The Rangers again experienced disappointment after Dolly Menga's goal gave the flag-winning side Steven Gerrard a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
The side from Ibrox wanted to record their first win at the opponent's stadium since they won 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard's second defeat within 18 games as manager, to score eight points on his side against Hearts leading the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and didn't seem to have the Rangers' line-up cut out of inspiration.
As the Rangers now dropped to sixth place, Livingston stepped up to third and just behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And there may be more problems waiting for the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to give a cure for the wound to the head after seemingly stoneing something from the opponent's side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side to defeat Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi 11 scored against the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with how his excellent group managed to keep their rivals in every turn.
The Rangers took over the ball but Livingston did more when the ball was on them.
They should have scored after two minutes after Allan McGregor's goal was to cross Menga's pass to Scott Pittman but the midfielder took a long time off.
A deep free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs was caught by Craig Halkett but no one could defend him Alan Lithgow instead of forcing him to steal the ball in the back post.
The Rangers managed to gain control but seemed to have far greater expectations than confidence that their plan could be done in the last third part.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a penalty kick by one-fourth of the game when Steven Lawless collided with them, but referee Steven Thomson interrupted the appeal of Colombian player.
The Rangers made two straight cuts in the first half of the game but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not tie the header of Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria's night strike.
Although Livi was scored in its 34th minute opening even though the opponent looked better, they could not be eligible for it because of their only graft.
The Rangers failed to move against the deep set-piece of the deep-seated Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not move when Declan Gallagher crossed the ball into the slot to Scott Robinson, who calmly passed Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action in the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and had almost the quick effect of replacing the winger when the winger was able to wrap up with Morelos, but he quickly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continues to make it difficult for visitors to play the exact type of game they want, where their long ball sweeps are successively Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's side would have been able to raise their only in the final stages but McGregor managed to keep Jacobs well before Lithgow could go wide from the corner.
Rangers' substitution Glenn Middleton had another last claim for a penalty for Jacobs' offense, but Thomson did not look again.
Almanac: The creator of the Geiger Counter
And now here's a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and PATULOY YOU HAVE NEVER...the day born in Germany is Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger who will be a physicist someday.
Geiger developed a technique for determining and measuring radioactivity, an invention that later transports a device called Geiger Counter.
An important part of science since then, Geiger Counter has also been a major supporter of pop culture, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," featuring the seemingly vague cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that ‘that thing'?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to refer to radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms caused by radioactivity on minerals."
He said, "It's definitely going to sound like that now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the inventor continued to hold on to his name.
A new vaccine against cancer teaches the immune system to 'determine' harmful cells
A new vaccine against cancer teaches the immune system to 'determine' harmful cells and destroy them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells
The procedure includes the removal of immune cells in the patient, and enhances them in the laboratory
They will then be able to 'determine' the protein that is common in most cancers and then inject them back
Tested vaccines provide good results for patients with different cancers.
For more than 18 months, cancer has been lost in the ovaries of a woman treated by the vaccine that teaches the immune system to determine harmful cells.
The procedure includes removing immune cells from a patient, and enhancing them in the laboratory for them to "determine" the protein common in most cancers called HER2, and then injecting cells back.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "It is implied to our results that we have a reliable vaccine."
HER2 is "causing the spread of many types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explains Prof Berzofsky.
The treatment of the type of leukaemia provides the same method of getting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to destroy cancer cells.
Kanye West joined the Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing a MAGA Hat, after his exit from SNL.
The results didn't make good
"boo" shouted Kanye West at the studio while performing Saturday Night Live after a long performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the position in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night, called Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great cap, he criticized Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"I've been talking to a white man many times and they're saying, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
"If I remember about racism, I'd have to leave America for a long time," he said.
The SNL began the show in a kit featuring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star enjoyed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Legal Decisions on sexual exploitation complaints posed by Christine Blasey Ford.
While it's not broadcast, social media comedian Chris Rock uploaded footage of West's embezzlement.
It's not clear if Rock has made it clear that West is ashamed of the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was not interrupted in the backstage about his hat.
"They put me in the back seat.
They say, ‘Don’t go out dressed ‘that hat’.
They've bullied me!
"They say I'm in the sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the sunken place?" he said, doing "I'm wearing my own partner and superman, because that means, you can't dictate to me what I should do. You want the world to flourish?"
Try to have love."
Due to his comments, the audience was booming at least twice and the cast members of the SNL were embarrassed, according to Variety's report, and there was one person there who expressed the publication: "The whole studio was filled with silence."
West was inducted as a sold-out buyer for singer Ariana Grande, who lost her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, just days ago.
Many were upset by West's performance of the song I Love it, where he was dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "For one of the strongest wills: THANK YOU AT THE MANNINGS OF THE WORKS."
But Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just a real and incredible one."
"But I choose NOT to recognize a person (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I think embraces and expresses the ideology that integrates with my community.
He has freedom.
We are the same," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had already changed the name, saying he is now "the formally recognized as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg had the name of the former Snoop Lion and of course, Prince's musical legend, who changed his name and became a symbol, and later became an artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington's critically acclaimed masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his character who excelled in the sword Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO's Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, strongly criticized the stereotype of the brush defender, according to him such roles on the screen lead to the frequent thinking of young men that they need to be tough to respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "have made a mistake" and questioned how to address the problem of harmful masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who was recently married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, also admitted that she wanted to discuss the issue.
"I have a lot of personal preferences right now - where do we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, based on the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television has a role in the rise of harmful masculinity due to its very strained characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is teaching?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young men think they need to be this kind of guy?
I think, ‘that's really one of the biggest questions of our time - how can we change ‘that?
It's clear that something is wrong for young people."
He also admitted in the interview that he would no longer make any prequel or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, as he said, "he's finished in the fields of war and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will be starring in Sam Shepard's True West remake of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently announced that they knew Rose's wife what she considered the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the ‘it' show, it's been a way for me to have a family in the future, and for my future life from here,' she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, who liked Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won the Emmy award.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property yard in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reported a 14<0x25> increase in the number of new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases have been passed through sexual intercourse, marking a change from the past.
HIV is usually spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to nearly zero in this way, according to Chinese health officials in a discussion in Yunnan province.
However, each year the number of HIV and Aids in China increases to 100,000 people.
A chronic issue in the LGBT community of China is HIV contagion by having sex.
Homosexuality was illegal in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT members is still widespread.
Due to the country's conservative appreciations, it is estimated in studies that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with a man eventually marry a woman.
Most diseases are caused by a lack of sexual contact protections.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged general access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters has denied that his staff has distributed GOP senators' data, and insists on "destructive lies" and "conspiracy theory"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of his staff posted personal information by three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages for legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrats insisted that the "ultra-right wing" plot of the "ultra-right wing" manunuries and the website of the complaints.
"A lie, a lie, and many more angry lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the report, the information included home addresses and phone numbers by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, posted by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill while hearing the Senate panel on allegations of sexual immorality against the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The information came a few minutes after the three senators checked Kavanaugh.
In Hill's report, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState linked to Waters' office announced the IP address referring to the source of the posts and it provided Waters' staff information.
"It's completely wrong and a lie is this unfounded charge," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - who has compromised the identity, personal information, and safety as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - has nothing to do with the spread of this information.
This charge is completely wrong and a lie is a baseless accusation."
Waters' statement quickly came online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"There's anger at this refusal," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that he does not have the necessary conduct of a Member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He should not be a fighter.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and respectful."
Fleischer has come out to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' denial of Judge Kavanaugh, which critics have accused of being too shy as the hearing takes place on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters' seat in midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"If there's any truth," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had been alerted "the appropriate authorities and entities in law enforcement of these deceptive complaints.
"We will ensure that we meet people with disabilities," he continued, "and they will be responsible for the law for all their destructive and risky activities to anyone and all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - suspended spy poof by Rowan Atkinson
It is now looking for importance for Brexit in any new film oriented to Britain and it appears to be applicable to the new version of the action-comedy spoof franchise of Johnny English - which began in 2003 in Johnny English and made noise again in 2011 in Johnny English Reborn.
Would it be a new opportunity to export the country's odd use of self-importance with a subject about how noticeable our lack of definitions are?
Despite all this, the big-eyed and slender Johnny English who doesn't have a license to beat things again for a second time - more than anything else, indicates his name that he is a viewing comic made for places where the audience doesn't speak English.
Of course, he is a crazy secret agent who despite his odds of pretending to be a swaying elegant has a few characters by Clouseau, with a character being Mr. Bean and mixed with the male version of a note in the Chariots of Fire melody theme for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson had previously played in what is now sent to Barclaycard's forgotten TV ads, where he caused chaos in his father's womb.
There is one or two beautiful scenes in this latest episode of JE.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter while wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades quickly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical humor can be seen, but too much humor has not become natural, especially with the confidence that now adding humor as an element to the brand of "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible.
There used to be humorous that it was intended for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's thickness comics were not as creative and as clear as Atkinson's silent-movie gag to Bean's persona.
The current premise that has long been experienced in the area is the place of Great Britain in difficult situations.
A cyber-hacker has entered Britain's highly confidential web network of spies, exposing the identities of all British agents in the field, causing frustration with the industrious agent - a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last thing to break the prime minister's an arrogant and arrogant man, who is already experiencing a complete anxiety over the lack of human support for him in politics: Emma Thompson refocused the performance of this pre-Teresa-There's a character but there's not much to be compared from the script.
His intelligence advisers informed him that since it was compromised that all active spies, he had to be returned from those who had already retired.
And that reference is the school-student Johnny English himself, who now works as the chief teacher at an exclusive institution, but provides private lessons on how to become an undercover operative: ‘it's funny, because English gives the vague-School of Rock an espionage academy.
English was immediately summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and he reunited with former long-running sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
Batman and Robin have come back to action with his Majesty's Secret Service, and they encounter the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of falling into the attraction of the charismatic tech billionaire that says he can solve British computer disturbances: the illogical Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their long adventures of humours: pretending waiters, they started a fire at a expensive French restaurant; they made a scene to ride without being noticed by Volta's graceful yacht; and began a massive mess with Volta's home when she tried to use Virtual Reality.
There's no doubt that everything is fine in that last sequence, but even if it's entertaining and repulsive, it's a waste of being a TV show.
Not much big thing.
And I can't stop myself thinking about other Johnny English films: wouldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that can bring justice to his talent?
Labour denies that it is considering planning to have four working days a week for Britons but they will be compensated for the equivalent of five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan to have the Britons four days a week working - but they will be paid for the equivalent of five days.
According to the party, the company's bosses want to pass the savings on a major change in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra rest day.
This will allow employees to have a three-day weekend - but they will still be able to return the same salary.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and the country's plans to favor workers.
The Trades Union Congress endorsed the exchange of four days a week working as a way to give workers opportunities to the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times that: "The announcement of policy analysis is expected before the end of the year.
"It can't be done one night but the four days a week working is a goal in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the good of the workers and also for the general approach to the party industry."
The Labour Party was not the first to endorse such an idea, as the Green Party promised to work four days a week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
Today, however, the Labour Party does not support this as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesman said: "The party will not policy four days of work a week and the party will not consider it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour's discussion last week to better explain his dream for a revolutionary economic socialism.
According to Mr McDonnell, he is purported to withdraw power from "unexpected directors" and "people who are taking advantage of the pipeline" to utility companies.
It also means shadow chancellor plans that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to get the entirety of their stake as the Labour government may impose 'deductions' for thoughtful misconduct.
He also signed plans to put workers on the company's boards and build the Inclusive Ownership Funds that will provide 10 percent of the equity of companies in the private sector to employees, which will have an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy said in "60 Minutes" if their minds could change in the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett led to the final vote in his nomination at least a week in the Supreme Court, and there was a question as to whether the department's findings would be for Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that took place on Sunday, "60 Minutes", correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if anything from possible FBI findings could change their minds.
Kennedy became more open than his partner from South Carolina.
"Yes," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after ‘this, after the accusation came out, I said, 'Did you do it?'
He's full of courage, he's determined, and he doesn't have a bathing suit."
However, Graham's vote did not seem to change.
"My mind is full of Brett Kavanaugh and a big accusation will be needed for it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not everyone who calls him will be able to confirm it.
It has been 36 years.
I don't see any change."
What is the Global Citizen's Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a tremendously amazing line-up of stars to perform and have a similar amazing mission; the end of the world's poverty.
In its seventh year today, the Global Citizen Festival will attend thousands of people who will meet at Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to gain knowledge for the real purpose of the event to end serious hardship by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively resisting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors to the concert have to complete a set of activities, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, calling on the phone or any meaningful thing to help spread the knowledge of their purpose.
But how successful is the Global Citizen now with only 12 years left before achieving the goal?
Is it an honest way to give people a free concert to encourage people who encourage action or simply add it to what is called "clicktivism" - people feel they are able to make real changes by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded more than 19 million "acting" from its supporters, which encourages the host of various purposes.
It said these actions helped encourage world leaders to announce provisions and corrections equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion that would make changes in the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 provisions and advertising derived from its action, and at least <0x24>10 billion of them have been spent or used for fundraising.
The group estimates that the secured funds have contributed directly to the impact of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main providers include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of U.K. investors and enforcers focused on "helping growing children discovering their full potential," promising to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4<0x25> of the global tweets.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can only footnote that in history the lack of social justice lack of nutrition," Tracey Ullman told people at live concert in London in April 2018.
According to the group, after more than 5,000 U.K. calls to focus on nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and young people through nutritional procedures.
In response to one of the FA<0x51>s on its website asking "how do you think we can get rid of the excess difficulty?"
The global citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes, we will fall down and fail.
But like those of us who have preceded great action on civic rights and action against white separation policy in black, we will succeed, because we are stronger when we are together.

U.S. may use the Navy to "block the passageway" to prevent Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington will be able to "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russia's energy transport to the market, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke said Russia's interaction with Syria - in particular where it operates due to the invitation of the legitimate government - is just a cover for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East they want to be as energy brokers as they do in the eastern part of Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, using our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, barangay, to ensure that their exercise does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees in the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that views itself as "the voice of energy consumption" in the US.
He compared Washington's ways to deal with Russia and Iran, saying that they are the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, approximately, to benefit and replace energy," he said, saying Russia had only "one thing to do" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements come as the Trump administration promotes the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, which replaces Russia, the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to lose the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said, is why Moscow has become "controlled" of Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is due to double its current pipeline capacity to be 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin insisted that Washington's strong opposition to the project was driven only by economic reasons and an example of unprecedented competition.
"I believe we both have a view that energy cannot be used as a means of shopping and suppliers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said in a September meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow.
The U.S.'s view from Germany, which strengthened its stand on the project.
The US called on Germany's leading organization for the industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"The problem is great when other states interfere with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Thinking Good" by Elizabeth Warren to run for presidential nomination in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that running in the presidential election would be "considered" following the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and include a woman as president," he said.
"After November 6, I really think about running the presidency."
Warren denounced President Donald Trump at the same meeting, saying that "this country is being taken in the wrong direction.
"I'm really very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our economy," he said.
Warren had previously expressed his criticism of Trump and the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's subordinates were not convinced that he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probably" voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent of the population are in support of the project.
Sarbey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's run, with 38 percent supporting a possible run and 48 percent against it.
Other high profile Democrats discussed in connection with a possible run in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and the Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would give an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin spent a year in Iraq, 26, after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with family violence on Monday night.
"With my son's passing on his return, I understand other families experiencing PTSD results and some of the feelings our soldiers have brought on their return," he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "great problem not to talk about" and said his son and other war veterans were "returning slightly different, they're back in practice with violence, asking if there's any respect for any given to the country by their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every member of the military."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was assaulted by family violence, particularly by women's pain, interference in reporting family violence and weapons possession while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports questioning new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal queries to a new U.S. policy withholding asylum to victims fleeing gang or family violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the friend-of-the-court district briefed Friday in Washington to support a person seeking asylum questioning policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff was not revealed in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
He said his partner "and his children members of the violent gang" abused him, but U.S. officials denied his request for asylum on July 20.
He was born in Texas.
Lawyers of states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are the source of a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as countries facing widespread gang problems and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed unauthorized immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy was "regarding decades of state, federal, and world law."
"The federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged based on particular facts and claims, and such prohibition violates such principles," the friend-of-the-court brief said.
The lawyers further argued in the brief that the policy of withholding immigrant entry was intrusive with the U.S. economy because they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "support the need for workers."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing family abuse and gang farmland.
"The asylum is for those who leave their home country due to racial, religious, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or a political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum is never intended to solve all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubled to rescue survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very nervous," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her pregnant baby boy at an evacuation center in the damaged city of Palu.
"Every minute there is an ambulance carrying a body.
Clean water is not enough."
Residents were seen returning to their damaged homes, picking up their wetware, trying to save anything they could see.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals have been exploded, damaged by a magnitude of 7.5 earthquakes.
Several of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who gained back and shoulder fractures, were outside the Army Hospital of Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to ongoing strong aftershocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he told how he felt a massive room earthquake on the fifth floor of the hotel where they were staying with his wife and daughter.
"We don't have time to save ourselves.
I was stuck in the falling wall ‘that's it,' Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town to attend a wedding.
"I heard my husband ask for help, after he's gone, he's quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassadors accused China of "struggling" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published four pages of advertising in a U.S. newspaper praising the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American newspaper to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred the paid statement to the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after China accused China of electoral interference for the U.S. congress on Nov. 6, a charge China has denied.
Trump's claim that Beijing is trying to intervene in the U.S. election has been a warning to US officials to Reuters that a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a growing trade war where they exchange tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariffs in the first phase of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, experts in China and the U.S. said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agribusiness products in China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion column on the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China, "is now undermining bullying by releasing propaganda advertisements in our own free newspaper."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the valued American tradition of free speech and free expression by releasing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"While in the newspaper stores here in Beijing, you see very little contradictory voice and you don't see a real picture of Chinese different opinions about China's worrying economic direction, because the Chinese Communist Party has a strict hold on the media," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers abstained from the offer to publish" this article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are pushing Botanite Women away before Midterms in Kavanaugh's riot, Guardians' Warning
While many major Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in front of several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warned that they would face severe reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions are very intense about it, and are seen in the majority of the Republican listed ones they want to continue voting.
Those things can't be left behind," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he would doubt enough of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) support for the FBI's investigation to ease the angry voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker for the modern group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is near!" as they rally in the Senate corridor because Republicans have chosen to hold Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be uncommon," Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's high; that's true.
But it can go up, especially in female swing voters in suburban areas and young voters, about 18- to 29-year-olds, who often don't vote, even though they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the nominee in the Supreme Court, analysts say there could be a strong reaction if Republicans continue the confirmation.
"This has been a big trouble for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about a committee vote or a vote or if Kavanaugh is going to be held, it's also about how Republicans hold on this issue and how they trinato him," explains Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to have come out as a split on who believes in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with fewer swaying at the end.
A new survey from YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents were certain or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they were certain or likely believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they think Kavanaugh probably lied to his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford confirmed before the Senate's Judicial Committee after swearing last week that he was abused by drunk Kavanaugh when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez accused him of having the Supreme Court nominee show him his king while they were in a party while they were still studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start a New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is a startup that aims to oppose Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company created from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people will be allowed to access for what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind Inrupt was to "cover the whole world."
"We need to do this now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can hide lists of contacts, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that's all available in a browser and all at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data store is that the user is fully controlled by who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "powering self by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to bring the company with methods, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several on-staff developers who were contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not a complete change in which all their business models will be completely reversible overnight."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created based on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very positive for it next time on the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Klerigong winner of the Victoria Cross in WW1 celebrated
The Church of England's only clergyman who won the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in attacking Bellenlise and Lehacourt.
But, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he won Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was removed from the cover of his two grandfathers at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "a bright symbol" to expose the rock 100 years from his grandfather's outstanding work.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion crossing the Canal de Saint-<0x51>uentin "in a very dense dew while a bullet struck from fields and machine guns."
Later, he went to the first row and led the line forward with "greatest bravery" before rushing with a field-gun and knocked out three of the team alone.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I couldn't bear but something that was humble."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also dedicated the flower crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it is honoring being part of the parade" and added that "the bravery of the real hero is shown by the support that many people will give."

Think about it, wake up all night to watch the Bellator 206 but you're not allowed to watch it.
The bill from San Jose contains 13 matches, including six of the main cards and aired live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
Around 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare for their presentation, viewers in the UK were surprised when the coverage changed and became Peppa Pig.
Some of them were dismayed after they left until it was early in the day.
A Twitter fan said that "it looks like a bad joke" was moving to the cartoon.
"The government will make it clear that at 6 a.m. it is not suitable to watch such a show so they had to move to the show," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator's marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Bellator's company president Scott Coker said they will set their schedule to include UK audiences in the future.
"When I think about replay, maybe we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it's Sunday morning and we can't fix it until Sunday morning.
But we fix it.
Believe me, when they moved there, there were a lot of repeating texts and all of them angry.
We're trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it has to do with the government.
I can promise that next time it won't happen.
We're only going to do five matches instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to give the fans a try but we're over-used.
It's just really problematic."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘lowness' due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling less than anyone else because of his sexuality - but that's what prompted him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't think until he reached secondary school "not all like him."
While speaking on Lauren Laverne's first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hopeful."
He also said that his desire to win the Olympics was reduced to his desire to win the Olympics.
The regular installer on the long-running show, with Kirsty Young, was on vacation for several months due to illness.
Coming out as a castaway on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "lower" than others as she grew up because "it's not easy to socially accept the likes of both men and women."
He said: "Until now, those feelings are lower than me, and I feel different, the real things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "different," he said, so he didn't fail everything when they learned about his sexuality later on.
The two-time winner of the bronze medal at the Olympics became a high-profile campaigner for LGBT and used his release at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live without consequences and wanted to give others "hopeful."
The three-besses global champion said that the love of a man - the US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "is a surprise to me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year but said the age gap had never been a problem.
"When you suffer a lot at a young age" - he first joined the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a man who experienced both happiness and sadness.
The couple became parents in June, to their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "full perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, what's important is, 'I need to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than gold medals in the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son named his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept him to die and one of his last questions was whether they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he liked the front seat.
"I can't tell him you're not going to sit in front of me," he said.
"I grabbed his hand when he stopped breathing and he really didn't breathe anymore and he was really dead that I accepted him unfamiliar with me," he said.
The following year Daley fought at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to drive in front of the people at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired her first choice song - Proud by Heather Small - that echoed her at the approaching Olympics and still built her feathers.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday and 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was not on the condition that Mickelson sat in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to fix his condition to prevent it from becoming a sad event.
Mickelson, who played at the biennial event for the record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as it often happens to him for the United States, the major winner splits his time between being a cheerleader and rehearsing in the range, hoping to correct anything wrong with him.
Because he never became the most direct driver even during the course of his career, the 48-year-old was not suited for the tight Le Golf National course, where the wrong shots on the long rough were often a problem.
And it seems that the difficult course is not enough, Mickelson, still faced the nineteenth match on Sunday, with British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who joined amateur Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If Americans, who fall four points starting in 12 singles matches, start hot, Mickelson's match may be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, because he had nothing to say.
"He fully understood his role today, took me to the back and guided me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a member of the team and has added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't want him to play two games.
I wanted more, but that was the case and ‘that’s what we thought we were going to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson passed Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup match played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of the race in the Ryder Cup that never matched his highest individual record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 wins, and seven boards, although Furyk said his presence brought some invisible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastically, smart, he's kidding people, and he's good with the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players enjoyed him, this week, and it's fun to see.
He's given more than a game."
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that he's just about to lose the big one.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knew it was easy to lose only the last day singles in the Ryder Cup and could be uncomfortable fighting it.
Dienmark started in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Sever Ballesteros as captain took five-points to the Americans but did not reach the finish line because the margin was too small, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You're always reminding yourself that we're only big at Valderrama; we've had a big win at Brookline, and we lost there, and at Valderrama, we won, but we're going to win," Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in that team that it is not over.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
It's not over until you put the points on the board.
We have a purpose, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus will remain.
I've said before, I'll focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what's on the other side - the best player in the world."
Congratulations on the performance of his players on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to lead myself here.
There's another monster tomorrow.
Open individual performances can be seen, and other activities ‘that'.
It's good to go out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, you can test the limits of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to understand the players, release everything you can tomorrow.
Now leave your partner and he needs to go and get out of his way."
Compared to Bjorn, opposing number Jim Furyk hopes his players will perform better as individuals than as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of major changes in the final day, as he was part of the winning Brookline team before being defeated when Europe displayed "Miracle and Medinah."
"I remember every word here," he responded when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you've seen in Brookline, as you've seen in Medina.
When the ‘that’ button goes in one direction, it brings a huge pressure to the middle matches.
We're doing our line-up as needed and we're releasing players because, you know, we're trying to magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the game and face Rory McIlroy in the top match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter who were other Europeans in the top half of the line-up.
"This is what I did after this group of players because I think it's the best until the end," Bjorn said in his selections for the singles.
Germany's new war has been postponed again
Germany's latest frigate must have been assigned in 2014 to purchase old warships dating back to the Cold War, but this will not be happening until next year due to system defects and growing costs, local media reports.
The appointment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper mentioning what a military spokesman said.
The ship must have been included in the Navy in 2014, but the big project has been in trouble due to serious issues after its deletion.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 would be exchanged for the old Bremen-class frigates.
Apparently they have powerful artillery, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-shipcraft missiles as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radars, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance time - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the ongoing delay means that the latest warships - which are said to be allowing Germany to show off overseas power - will be old-fashioned when it comes to service," Die Zeit said.
The unfortunate F125 frigate became the head of news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and return it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after it was re-delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited some "defects of essential software and hardware" that caused the warship to be useless if it was deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are more important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be run by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of the older Bremen class frigates.
Furthermore, the ship was out too heavy to reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the same ship classes used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - rising from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems solving the latest frigates are becoming increasingly important because of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
In the first part of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the defence committee of the parliament of Germany, admitted that the Navy had actually "runned ships that could still be deployed."
The official said the issue had grown over time, as the old ships were removed but no replacement ships were given.
He said that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were involved in the Navy.
The National Trust seeks to preserve the lives of the birds
The new research conducted outside a Scottish Highlands estate aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is expected to illuminate the behavior of strange flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrels as well as brown long-eared barks and Daubenton barks at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis in all recordings will prove the frequency of bats and which specie makes which sound.
Then, a home map will be created to have a more detailed landscape-scale description of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes to reveal the results of which areas of residence are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information helps to know the benefits of residential management work such as creating a field and what is the best way to minimise the woods for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the UK has been substantially reduced over the past century.
They are threatened from construction and development work that affects nesting and habitat loss.
Air-driven turbines and lightning can also cause danger, as well as flypapers and some chemicals treated by building materials, as well as cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind.
However, because of their hunting at night their ears are more helpful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to determine insects and obstacles to the path they are going through.
The bats are important to the NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide.
It has trained experts, who regularly perform sarcasms, inspect nests and sometimes rescue rescues.
The organization even established the first and only reserved reserve ground for bat in Scotland at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager David Thompson claims that the estate is the best territory for them.
"We've got a good place to play," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all beautiful dwellings.
But there's a lot more to know about bats, so we're doing something here and other assets to understand more about what they need to survive."
He emphasizes the importance of inspection if there are bats before performing maintenance within the property because it is possible to accidentally destroy even a single mother's nest could kill 400 women and young bats, potentially exterminating the entire local population.
The bats are protected and unlawful to kill, harass or throw them away or destroy their nests.
Scotland official for Bat Conservation Trust Elisabeth Ferrell is urging the public to help.
He said: "We have a lot to learn about our bats and we don't know the climate of many of our species."
Ronaldo ignored allegations of rape as lawyers were preparing to file a case against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape against him "fake news," saying there were people who "wanted to censor themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are due to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus are accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
While talking to an Instagram Live video with his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, said the reports were "fake news."
"No, no, no, no.
"What they say today," said the camera, who won the Ballon d'Or five times.
"They want to use my name.
Normal ‘that.
They wanted to be famous so my name was mentioned, but it was just a ‘work'.
"I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations, which they called "an unacceptable reporting of privacy suspects," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would file a payment for "moral damage to the amount equivalent to the weight of intrusion, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred allegedly in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped the woman, according to papers presented to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell down after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" was the "beautiful man" who had been thwarted by "one percent."
Documents that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but both of them liked it.
Mayorga also says he went to the police and took a picture of his wounds in a hospital, but later agreed to an area because "he was afraid of retaliation" and thought "to be embarrassing to the public."
The 34-year-old says that he is now seeking to reverse the staggering as he continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'living regret' loss of car makers
UK's "living regret" if it loses its position as world-leading in vehicle manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that "concerned" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without a deal it would temporarily split production at its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of border delay in the event that there is no Brexit agreement could lead to loss of jobs.
The plant in Burnaston - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis - made about 150,000 vehicles last year and 90<0x25> of it exported to other parts of the European Union.
"I think if Britain will leave the EU by the end of March production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the head director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have released their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement on how to trade on borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its Oxford Mini plant a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what vehicle manufacturers say are the risks of supply chain in the event of no Brexit agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated on the "just-in-time" basis where parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for vehicles made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be border disruption that the industry says could cause delays and lack of shares.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU "is well-organized to prevent such border investigations."
"We need to have an agreement. We want the best agreement to allow not only to enjoy the success at the moment but to benefit this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Based on the evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, we need to be fully able to continue any highly successful supply chain team."
Toyota can't say how long production will last, but warns that in the long run, additional costs will reduce the plant's ability to compete and will eventually cause loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, who is growing concern by his members: "In my experience, once lost, these jobs will not be restored.
A government spokesman said: "We have already presented a proper and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again, according to White House
Donald Trumpat's very important meeting of deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed again" as the problem with the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, according to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special councillor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference with the election, ties between Trump's and Russia's aides and possible deterrence by the president of justice.
It has been a matter of months whether Trump will blame the deputy attorney general, and whether Mueller's independence is at risk.
In the first part of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record their Trump conversations and the possibility of ousting the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" suspend Rosenstein but delayed the meeting to avoid a dispute over the hearing of the Senate judiciary committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which was more delayed in full Senate voting.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There is no deadline for it, maybe this week, it may be postponed for another week due to all other things taking place in the supreme court.
"We're going to keep updating the press."
Some reporters have been protesting that he said: Sanders has not held a press briefing in the While House since September 10th.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to the dislike of the TV reporters' "sweetening", although he said: "I'm not against that they're too obese."
Then, he indicated that direct relations between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president's <0x51><0x26>A sessions are doing more than those before him," he said, adding without mentioning evidence: "We're looking at these numbers."
There will be briefings," Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask itself the president of the United States, that's better than talking to me."
We've been trying to do that often and you've seen us do it frequently over the past few weeks and it will replace the press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president has probably shown why, in the manifestation of formality and sometimes eccentricity in front of reporters.
Secretary of Health wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU personnel working at the NHS of Scotland to express their gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter in less than six months left until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has pledged to meet the value of applications for settled status for EU citizens working with its devolved public services.
In his letter, Ms Freeman said: "In the past summer, discussions between the UK and the EU on departure continued, hoping to make decisions this fall.
But the UK Government also stressed its preparations for a possible lack of agreement.
I know it's a worrying time for all of you.
So I want to repeat now how important each person's contribution is to me, regardless of their nationality.
Fellowships from all over the EU, and beyond that, bring important experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of health care services, and are benefited by the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie joined the emergency operation after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went to the sideline and fell there," Reed said.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by trainers and medical personnel on the sideline before he was placed in the strutcher and taken for further ovulation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no further details on the type/mind of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out where the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, was in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign property purchases in the UK will be charged with higher stamp duty
Foreign buyers will charge higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and use additional money to help the homeless under new Tory plans
The step is to counter the success of Corbyn's desire to attract young voters
Increases the rise of the stamp duty to non-payers in the UK
The Yemeni government expects it to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year - to help uninhabited people
Foreign buyers are set to charge higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and will use additional money to help the homeless, Theresa May announced it today.
The step will be considered as a counter to the success of Jeremy Corbyn's wishes to attract children voters with promises that will provide affordable housing and target large-scale income earners.
Stamp duty increases will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and will use additional money to support the Government's desire to resolve street sleep.
The surcharge - which adds to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels implemented two years ago in secondary residences and in houses purchased for rent - may be up by three percent.
The Bank expects this step to come up with up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new-owned properties are bought by UK non-residents, which increases prices so it becomes harder to buy a house for the first time.
Many rich places in the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because many foreigners buy that are not in the country most of the time.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposes a reduction in stamp duty to help young adults buy their first home.
He blamed large construction companies for continued high-priced property prices by buying land but it was not used, and urged Mrs May to hang the quotas in affordable homes to fix the "depressive housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced compelling series of proposed housing reforms, including regulating rent and ending evictions for "no reason".
He also wanted to give the council greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would provide my premiership in restoring Britain's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that there is a solution to the problematic housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and have a life here.
However, it's not that easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as for overseas-based companies, to buy houses such as hard British residents.
Too many people dream of having a home, and the indignity of sleeping on the street continues to be a real problem."
Jack Ross: 'My ambition is to govern Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "absolute ambition above all" is to be the ruler of Scotland when the sun comes up.
Scot, 42, appreciates the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club, currently in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was ‘that'," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child, and there was always something like calling me back.
That would only be a chance if I was successful in the club's management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss said he had no fear of following such known names at such a large club, after offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town were rejected.
"The success for me at this moment will be based on 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the arrangement and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly included in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to take it there, but maybe I'll just consider myself successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross was only three years in his management career, after becoming assistant boss at Dumbarton and being part of the Hearts coaching staff for 15-months.
Subsequently, he helped Alloa recover from the downside of the third tier, and changed St Mirren from the inning down to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Perhaps a little bit," he recalls about the management of Allaah.
"I really believe that management is suited to me, more than playing.
It's a little weird because I'm playing well, I've been able to live here, and have a good time.
But it's hard to play.
You have a lot of things to do every week.
I’m still struggling with stress and stress at work, but the management is just right.
I've always wanted to be in control and now I'm doing this, it's the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt in myself for the rest of my life as an adult."

According to Sarbey, Saturday 5:30pm is the best time for a pint
The hot summers have increased the sales of pub sufferers in Britain but have brought more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar sales rose by 2.7 percent in July - but sales in restaurants declined by 4.8 percent, based on figures.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA said that it was the number one: "England's continued rising sunshine and the longer expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed what happened in June, when the pub sales rose by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants took a lot more seriously.
The decline by 1.8 percent in the sales of restaurants in June worsened in July.
The sale of pubs and bar drinks is the most powerful of the main goods, and if the two seasons are erased, they are higher than the downsides of the restaurants.
Summer also doesn't have a good effect on food pubs, although it's not as good as the restaurant operators put in.
People just want to go out and drink.
In regulated pubs and bars the sales of the beverage rose by 6.6 percent for the month, and the food sales dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman of RSM reviewers of Leisure and Hospitality said: "These results continue the trend we've seen at the end of April.
The time and effect of large social or sporting events remains the biggest thing that affects the market of those outside their homes.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups are still struggling, and sales drops by 4.8 percent per year will be more painful when it is added to the continued pressure of expenses.
The long summer weather is not good for food operators and time can only tell if the situation will improve with the arrival of the colder temperatures we have experienced in August."
The total increase in sales to pubs and restaurants, including new tomorrows is 2.7 percent in July, indicates a slowdown in the release of brands.
Industry sales tracker Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined revenue of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and this is the established industry basis.

A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - referring to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news highlighted the fears of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a clean "main" account shown to parents, while they also have private accounts.
A mother who accidentally saw the secret site of her 13-year-old son encounters a teenager who encourages other people to "save me."
Research, produced by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted they had private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is concerned that so many teenagers are attracted to make internet spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "bosses for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general assembly of the government branch.
Doyle is Scotland's track and field athlete with the most wins and chairman Ian Beattie has described the step as a good opportunity for game-leaders to benefit from his extensive global level experience in the past decade.
"Ilidh has great respect for Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from bringing him to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm interested in standing up as an athlete's voice and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta with his total of four golds at the Olympics and is now a regular expert at the BBC, was unable to walk after having a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month since I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
Doctors only tell me if I'm healthy or at a certain level.
It's hard work, but I'm completely healed, I've learned how to walk and now I'm working to avoid it!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Have a look at the internet about advertising for breast pumps where mothers compare to cows
The breast pump company splits the internet's opinion due to advertising where breastfeeding mothers compare to cows.
To mark the launch of what they said was "the world's first silently worn breast bump," the company Elvie released a humorous sarcastic music video advertisement to show the freedom the new pump provides to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of straw in the play with lyrics such as: "Yes, I'm setting myself up but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed I'm not sniffing 'those, my breasts 'that'."
The choir continued, "Pick it up, pick it up, I'll put it on the baby, pick it up, pick it up, I'll make my boobs work."
But the advertising has caused controversy over the internet, which has already been published on the company's Facebook page.
There have been 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, and the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it dominates the "violent" in the dairy industry.
"It's really not a good decision to use cows to advertise the product.
We need to get pregnant and give birth to milk, so it's only a few days after birth," one said.
The Elvie Breast Pump is completely unknowingly inside the Nursing Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "It's a traumatic first for both mother and baby.
"Why don't you use them to promote breast pumps for mothers who don't stay away from their babies?"
Another said: "There is no free advertising."
Some of the other people expressed their appreciation, and a woman admitted that the song was "laughing" for her.
"This is an idea for me.
I would have bought it if I had been breastfeeding.
I felt like I was really feeling like a squirrel.
Advertising is also a bit confusing, but I think that's the way it is.
"It's a product," said one.
Another commented: "It's a disappointing advertisement for moms who pump (often in their trabaos or cubes) and like " cows" feel.
It's not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women will reveal that they all dance with inexpensive pumps inside their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and fits inside the nursing bras unknowingly, so women are more able to move, they are easier to hold their babies, and are able to even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD commented to Mother: "The Elvie Pump has brought a huge change so it should be given a strong and exciting launch.
Comparing pumping women and cows we wanted to be able to draw attention to the milk pumping and all the hard about it, while showing in the comfort and first way the great comfort the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has been headlined.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mother of two-year-old son came up for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Boys Silently Moved to a Tent Camp in Texas Border
The number of teenage migrants has risen even though the monthly border crossing remains unchanged, partly because it has become more difficult to put children in sponsorships as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration.
Generally, most sponsors have also become non-documented immigrants, and are afraid to put their own ability to stay in the country when they receive a child.
The risk rose in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would need to submit a fingerprint, and share the data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to sponsor unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the individual sponsors or members of the sponsors' household are here in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
"We're still trying to get people," Mr. Albence said.
In order for children to be processed more quickly, officials have implemented new policies to assign their appearance to the court within a month of decetine, rather than 60 days later, which is the former standard, according to those working in the shelter.
Many will be faced with video conference calls, rather than personal, to explain their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for help are quick to deport.
As children have been in custody for a longer time, they are more likely to be upset or sad, which can lead to intense anger or attempt to escape, according to shelter workers and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Supporters said that those concerns were more severe in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering are unlikely to notice, due to its size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without providing enough time to prepare their emotions or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many have experienced.
"U.S., France and Turkey say they'll leave immediately"
While speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces in the Syrian land would remain illegal, "exposed to fight terrorism," and "to face it as appropriate."
"They have to leave immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the fight against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more had to be removed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "encourage sacred warfare until the Syrian territories are removed" by both terrorist groups and "any foreign presence that is illegal."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and counseling Kurds forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the country suffering from war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were okay for them to return, and he blamed "their western country" for "excluding unjust fear" which prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the global community and humanitarian organizations to encourage these returns," he said.
"They're politically correcting a full-fledged issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there is no help for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition has been reached to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created the opportunity to continue political talks.
In the Russian and Turkish treaty, extensive attacks by Syrian forces assisted by Russia in the province, in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the treaty had "clear margins" and expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-<0x51>aeda, who were "extreme."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members will be held to write down the basic post-war law for Syria and extend the election.
Moualem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, and said the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of current basic law," and warned against interference.
Why Trump won the second term
In that logic, Mr. Trump will again win the 2020 election except, as many liberal viewers may expect, if his presidency is to be prematurely overrun by the ouster and scandal.
In an unprecedented "Presidential End!"
Today, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have been raised to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly triple to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable ratings at a rate of 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, running the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which was about a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
He recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told him he was going to kill Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'It makes me laugh,' Ms. Scovell said to me.
Disturbance is inconvenient.
Of course, unlike others on TV, stories coming from Washington can affect the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families are together again, and the health of the global economy.
The one who does not listen is a luxury that can only be done by the richest viewers.
But beyond being a smart citizen when you're six hours to watch the panel of experts who debate Bob Woodward's use of a "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," on Paul Manafort's <0x24>15,000 bomber jacket made of the ostrich's skin, "the most beautiful piece of the soap," said The Washington Post.
If it were me, I would have been different from Super Mario.
"For what he's doing so it's like this reality show is because he's going to be offered you every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's spinning show cast and the daily change in the story.

When I hit Mr. Fless this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while CNN was re-recording.
He could not leave the show, especially when Brett Kavanaugh was due to appear on the Senate Judicial Committee and suspended the future of the Supreme Court.
"I saw when we were making funny shows then and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money from the outside comes down to the toughest fight in Congress in the midterm election
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th cash rush, thanks to the change in the congressional districts that resulted in the fighting of the two currently sitting for the same position.
It recently contested the Pittsburgh district re-election Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won the seat in another district in a special spring election.
Lamb is running against another currently sitting Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently the representative of Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is really fueled by the new 17th.
Maps were drawn again after the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January that the old districts were manipulating in violation of the basic law in favour of Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th initiated a campaign fund between the main party's leadership branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became familiar with the name of Pennsylvania after winning very little in a special election in March which was watched by many for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
Republicans have held that position for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave Democrats little.
U.S. Contrary to El Salvador Punishment for Support in China, Then Turns Back
Diplomats who have acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have acknowledged Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a fine meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners disbanded Trump's governing Organization team.
State Department officials have decided to return American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions no longer to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
But only the sanctions against El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in aid from America in 2017, included for narcotics controls, development support and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which included calculus of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been very painful for the country in Central America and the high level of unemployment and execution there.
As internal meetings were launched, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic development to follow a similar one-year meeting that was seen as a step forward towards preventing migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration officials made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is set to speak at the conference, which will be held in mid-October, as a sign of administration appreciation for the gathering, diplomats said.
And the three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new rigorous message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition that they would not be named.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outsider who was close to the administration and also spoke on condition that he was not named.
Let's study history
What will happen next is a report by special councillor Robert Mueller on possible prevention of justice, which now has a lot of evidence on the public record.
Mr. Mueller is now redirecting his investigation into whether Trump's campaign with Russia has negotiated its attack on our electorate.
If the holder of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility for this branch, as he prepares to re-elect, and will probably later face a jury consisting of his counterparts.
There's a lot of that, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - or his European counterparts.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic have many decisions that will affect how long the conflict will take.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to make a coup d'<0xC3><0xA9>tat against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the next three years of shooting.
History revolves around such points of change in direction, and accelerates or delays the inevitable progress of democracy.
Americans are facing some of the points of this change today.
What would we do if Mr. Trump blamed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controlled the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on the verge of reporting that, last year, he secretly proposed a re-recording of the president and even gave speculation that the president was inappropriate for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' narrative is inaccurate.
"How can we respond if the new F.B.I. inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?"
And most of all, will we vote in midterms a Congress that would be accountable to Mr. Trump?
If we fall into those trials, the winter of democracy will last a long time.
But I don't think we're going to fall, because of the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once occupied my home as ambassador.
He survived, went to America and, 60 years later, lit me the Sabbath candles in that swastika brand.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers Optimistic in the upcoming match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following an impressive board in Spain against Villarreal in early this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from coming out of the season to 2-2 boards at Villarreal but he believed Rangers could use that result as a boost to bigger things.
"It's a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and come out with points.
We might have had it in the end, but, in the end, it might have been a good result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
On Thursday, it was a big night in Europe.
I hope we get three points but the game will be difficult because they have a good result in their last game, but people support us, so I'm sure we will fight and get a positive result.
Last year was really hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a good feeling in the area right now.
The team was very good and the members really enjoyed it; the training was good.
We hope that we will be able to fight now, be able to go through the past season and be successful."
Women's fears of retaliation
Despite the fact that Sarbey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their family members about it.
About half of the number of individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their wives about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want to take care of a family member, but they don't take any steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide business life insurance.
This can start here.
Talk to your wife and children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't say your preferences early.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where and how to take care of them, because these decisions will be a big deal.
Include your financial counselor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your options for long-term care may include traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help answer these expenses or ensure yourself with your own money - if you have money.
Fix your legal documents: Try to avoid legal problems.
Have a proxy for health care so that you can assign a trustworthy individual to take charge of your medical care and make sure that professionals follow your preferences in case you can't speak.
You also have the power of attorney for your finances.
A trusted person will choose you to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid when you can't do it.
Don't forget the little details: Think your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Fill out these details with a written plan for you to be ready.
"It's not just financial, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to prepare for that plan."
Man shot multiple times by air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times using the air rifle as he walked home one night.
The victim, aged about 40, was at Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as "casual action."
The victim didn't see the gunman.
His injuries were not dangerous in life and the police called on the witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Due to the disruption of communication lines, there was no access to any information from the agencies that provided assistance from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some basic information about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a regency with more than 300 km (180 miles) of beaches in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The population was estimated at 299,200 in 2017 by the regency, which is an administrative region lower in the province.
Fishing and planting are the main economic incomes of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of it is in Morowali, on the other coast of Sulawesi.
Tsunamis have hit Palu and Dongala several times over the past 100 years, according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the deaths of more than 200 people and the destruction of hundreds of homes in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located in the western part of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific and is regularly experienced by the earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, 226,000 people have been killed off the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of them are in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, and nearly 700 people die.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which triggered a tsunami rising 10 meters that destroyed dozens of areas and caused the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, which caused destruction and fear because people remembered the destruction caused by a massive earthquake and a tsunami in 2004.
There were no subsequent tsunamis this time, but more than 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists in a temporary emergency.
Sarah Palin Arestado's First Lady on Family Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected family violence, interference in reporting family violence and resistance to the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a known woman attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin took the phone to her.
Palin was deported to Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and was in custody based on a <0x24>500 unsecured bond, the KTU reported.
He went to court on Saturday, where he declared himself "no offense, sure" when asked his defense, the network reported.
Palin faced three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanour, with a one-day jail sentence and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal cases.
In December 2017, he was accused of hurting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was plagued by family injury, interference in the reporting of family violence, and shielding weapons while drunk in connection with the incident.
His wife told him that Palin hit him on the face.
Sarah Palin took part in a group of veterans in 2016 after she linked her son's violent actions to PTSD that came from her Iraq service.
An earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude tsunami earthquake and thousands of homes destroyed it.
Electricity has been cut and communications lines are broken and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
An earthquake struck near the centre of Sulawesi located in the northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media showing the very moment of the earthquake strike.
Hundreds of people gathered at the pleasure of the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
New York federal prosecutors have called for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the New York City terror attack suspect who has been killed by eight people -- a rare penalty that has not been enforced in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a Home Depot truck to carry out a cycling road attack along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, which attracted people walking and cycling on his path in October.
To justify the death sentence, Saipov prosecutors had to prove that Saipov was "intentional" to kill eight victims and "intentionally" would cause serious bodily harm, according to notification of the intent to demand the death penalty, which was offered in the Southern District of New York.
These two charges may be subject to death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed against Saipov of 22 perfect along with eight counts of killings supporting extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and accused of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack needed "great preparation and planning," and described Saipov's way of accomplishing it as "bad-dump, cruel and outrageous."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," wrote in the announcement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade since the Southern District of New York has been prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was later sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the couple who were hanged after they were convicted of conspiracy for spying for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years ago.
Rosenberg's wife was murdered in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistan tube, did not show any regrets in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, in a statement.
He also asked to display the IS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He was not guilty of 22.
David Patto, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "disappointed" by the proceedings' decision.
"We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting the admission of sin for life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma caused by these events to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations according to Tory MP
Nigel Farage promised to "move the people's army" today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of Ukip said politicians needed to "feel pressure" from the Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that the UK would "would have gone out now" if Mr Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge of Mrs May's future to reconcile her group was emphasized by Tory's participation in favour of Staying in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The premier found it difficult to keep the pace of his Chequers compromise plan in the midst of attacks from Brexit Favors, those who want to stay and in the EU.
Allies insist that he will continue to try to get a deal with Brussels despite a poor reaction - and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and the 'conflict'.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'disappear the Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be peered and given responsibility for negotiations in Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I'll support Brexit but we have to look at the Chequers.'
In releasing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We don't fight world wars just to be obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone has dismissed the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that Britons have changed their minds and they want to stay.'
Tory's Brexit Favor Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told the announcers: 'What I'm saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The public harassment doesn't like the Chequers, the Opposition won't vote for it, our party and our activists don't want it to be the one who walks the street and raises us.
Please, forget the Chequers and start listening."
In a press message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime ministers will stay in place if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians at the rally would have to "feel pressure" if they intend to abandon the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now about the confidence between us - people - and our politicians," he said.
'They're trying to abandon Brexit and we're here now to tell them 'we're not going to let you do 'that'.'
In a message to enthusiastic groups of people he added: "I want you to feel pressure on our politicians, who intend to turn Brexit back.
"We are moving the people's army in this country that has given us success in Brexit and we will not stop until we are free, govern ourselves, high-ranking United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who wanted to stay until Birmingham before a two-hour rally took place in the city centre.
There have been scandalous activists waving banners of Tory Against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis denied the Conservatives because of the security issues they craved in a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can put IT systems and all the technology for Canada and more, so that there is no border accompaniment, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's just a laugh.
There's nothing better than Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "think carefully" the presidency
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that "think carefully about running for presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats discussed his future in a town hall in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who was a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, was running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was joint chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He is in the midst of speculation that he will fight Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke held its 36th meeting with the subordinates using the town hall format since Trump's seat.
One of them asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and include a woman as president."
Someone was arrested for the death of Sims LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La. on Saturday announced that a suspect was arrested when LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was shot and killed on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got the right bullet in the head he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defends his friend and Simpson shoots him.
Simpson was asked and admitted to be in the crime scene, hand-armed, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to world title after team orders give him the win from Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas has been clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team will play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in his defense of his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to command his teammate.
Vettel first stopped the pit and left Hamilton to go into traffic at the end of the group, something that should have decided on the result.
Mercedes clinched a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came ahead after the gig in which Ferrari's driver hesitated to leave the inside for free risk of continuing to apologize after a double-move for retaliation in the third quarter.
Max Verstappen started from behind the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
Subsequently, he led a major part of the race as he went on to run for a quick finish and captain Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth.
He eventually stopped pitting in the 44th lap but was unable to speed up his run in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri did well throughout the weekend and it really made me feel comfortable and comfortable.
"The team did extraordinary things to have one-two," Hamilton said.
Really Bad Body Light ‘Yon
President Donald Trump denied Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for his insistence that he did not disclose the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly question Ford's testimony given before the Senate Judgement Committee, instead he commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "violent and evil and lying".
"One thing that can happen and the good things happen in the past few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and cruel and evil and lying," he said.
"When you see the displays and revelations after they say, 'Yeah, I'm not doing that.
I'm not doing that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you baptized?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the document - "ah, ah, what?
Ah, no.
I'm not baptized."
Just wait.
"No, no, we're not going to be," he added, as the senator looked at him.
Feinstein received the letter with details of allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and revealed it in early September - but Feinstein denied that his office had disclosed.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and that's what I did, as he asked."
But his previous refusal to the president, who commented at the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's really bad body movement 'that's it.
He probably didn’t do it, but ‘that’s the worst body movement I’ve ever seen.’
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president said Democrats used the allegations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
"You see violence, evil, they don't care who will be hurt, who they want to get power," Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned to the Belfast Giants' defeat in the Elite League on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 for Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored just two goals with strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie cleared the home side before Dwyer returned only the Giants.
Francois Bouchard sued the game for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen's two goals scored the victory.
It was the third in the Elite League of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who came from behind to defeat Dundee by 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth season of the two sides, winning the Giants in the last three games.
Dwyer's opener entered in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, and David Rutherford gave an assist while Beauvillier was diodobled just four minutes later.
In the busy opening period, Sullivan returned the home side to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie's pants to 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants would take the lead in the first break when he achieved his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home side reunited and Bouchard drove them again with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee only for the first time in the game in the last half of the second period and he ensured the win in his team's fifth half until the final period.
The Giants, now three out of four of their last five games, return home and head for Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Killed While Ensures Old Airplane Survive
An Indonesian air traffic controller was called a hero after he died while ensuring that a plane with hundreds of people could fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continued to shake the area and many were stuck in the ruined buildings in the city of Palu.
Despite the evacuation of his colleagues to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat at the burgeoning control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu Airport.
He left to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
Then he jumped into the traffic control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts are broken in this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the death toll could reach thousands, as according to the country's disaster mitigation agency, access to the towns of Dongha, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number is still rising because many more bodies are under collapsed buildings while others are inaccessible," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters were destroyed by Palu to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircrafts are carrying aid and supply.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with carrying bodies.
Clean water is not enough.
Small shops have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every evacuation work.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit in the first part of this year by earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
A plane crashed in Micronesia: According to Air Niugini a man is missing after plane crashed into the lake
The airline now says it was running the plane that crashed into the Pacific lake in Micronesia with a man missing, after it was first said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday afternoon, a male passenger could not be found.
The airline said it is collaborating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find such a man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and personnel after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk island airport.
Officials said on Friday seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in good condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lake and did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"It's a really good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers were able to walk through the water until it was cleared to emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were frightened and screaming, and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said it also helped rescue sailors who arranged the port nearby by using a flying boat to transport people to the beach before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes over the past two decades but no Air Niugini has yet been involved.
The story of the night when a woman was killed in a fire
The prosecution ended its argument on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of a life-threatening incineration with a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cellphone records to pinpoint the actions of 29-year-old defendant <0x51>uinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting Tellis' earlier remarks, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that the man's cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was somewhere else that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "t lied, because my truck was in Nashville then."
Another unmatched was what Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on phone records, they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis broke Chambers' texts, calls and contact information on his phone.
"She ruined the girl in her life," Hale said.
The defense is set to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
Three hip hops want to challenge a negative view of the genre by putting positive messages in their music.
The High Breed, who is from Bristol, claims that hip hop has withdrawn from its political messages and responded to social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and recreate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common are re-branded in the UK by artists such as Alekala and Lowkey.
It's black again?!
A New York Times man accused a couple of quitting his job after a "racist" text
A New York report filed a lawsuit against the couple for smuggling her out of work after receiving a mistransmitted text from the mother who complained that she was "black again."
The couple denied that they were racist, and dismissed the lawsuit to "disgust."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, two children, expressed disappointment when she learned that her new child, Giselle Maurice, was a black man when she arrived on her first day at work in 2016.
"HindiIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM NAMEN," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in her text to her husband.
So, instead of sending it to his wife, he was able to send it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman blamed Ms. Maurice, saying that her ex-boyfriend, who was an African-American, and what she hoped was a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice paid for her one day at work and was sent home to Uber.
Today, Maurice sued the couple for a job elimination payment, and demanded a payment of <0x24>350 per day for a six-month, stay-in job he would have, though there was no contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding that "I know it's discrimination."
The couple, however, pleaded guilty to racist charges, saying that Maurice's removal from work was reasonable, fearing they could not trust her after they hurt her feelings.
"My husband sent me a message that he didn't really want to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco in the Post.
"But do you trust your children to someone you've been hurt, even if it's unintentional?"
Your baby's new baby?
Not ‘not’.
While comparing the lawsuit to "disgust," Plasco said that just two months after her husband's birth and "extremely suffering from the situation."
"You're going to kill someone like that?
"It's not a good thing," added the investment banker.
As the case continues, the public quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not like the speaking bear, revealing a new letter
The letter of Bond's son Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's fun to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
Confident even though rejecting his work, he said of his father, who worked as the BBC's cameraman before getting inspiration from the little bear toy who wrote the childhood book, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and added that his father was proud of success later on.
"He's a quiet man, and he's not shy," she said.
"But because Paddington is true for him, it's like your child has achieved something: you're proud of them even if you don't do it.
I think that's what it looks like for Paddington's success.
Although it was created and imaginary, he gave Paddington the honor of himself."
I'm on the phone when my son dies.
When her son was born at the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried but failed to save her life.
"Nad called to say that it was really bad, that there was no hope for him to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"After that, I received a call from Nad saying that he would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And that’s what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, son.
I was soon there.
I'll be with you.
The drug was gradually depleted and lost in his body the medications doctors gave him to keep the pumping of his heart.
He died before this and ‘that everything was shut down’.
I can't just sit there and wait, as I know it all happens.
I couldn't cry or cry because there were so many families and people around me.
I had to stop everything."
Later, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was then grieving for her son's departure, was on a plane with other passengers - unaware of what he was going through.
"No one knows," he said.
"I was so tired, I didn't stop crying.
It was hard to explain, but when I was on the plane I felt very sorry for Nadd.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know he loves the child."
Women who are trying to put their cards on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones from suicide are trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place on the Welsh bridge of cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Ms Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, hopes to be the chef of his son with a smiling face.
"Everyone knows him for his smile.
He always said that his smile was good."
He left the job before he died, because he was "very sad."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother saw his brother after his suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that it will have an effect."
Ms Davis made cards, "to tell people that they can go and talk to them, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet - you have to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who had been friends with Ms Davies for 15 years, left his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's departure.
"He didn't say he was depressed or depressed or anything," he said.
"Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
She was sad on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts she didn't stay with them."
He said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to accept it: "It's really a huge loss in the family.
We're squirming.
We all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's next day suspended as the FBI begins the investigation
"I thought, if we could do something like he requested - an investigation in limited time, the scope would be limited - there would be at least a bit of unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of "disrupting" that the committee was amidst the tides of the parties.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their doubts are all due to the time.
The midterm elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans will not succeed, they will be too weak in their attempts to get what they want at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls on the Senators, speaking to them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through which he met his wife Ashley, then Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to resolve the vote board and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's "defector" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un sat seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
While citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher human smuggling charges were a big deal.
Pyongyang has no public comment.
Most defectors from North Korea are eventually offered by South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee by China, with the longest border in North Korea and easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them back.
The relationship between the North and the South has been substantially reduced in recent months - which is in fact still fighting.
In early this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on delayed negotiations related to denuclearization.
It came after a historic meeting in June by US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on general limits for the deal to the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of launches since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we will never be able to pre-discriminate," Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "very noisy," unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Minority Chief in the Lower Congressional Assembly Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "highly noisy" and said that because of her behavior she was not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman comes up like that, they'll say 'very loud'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judgement Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming at some instances and crying while discussing his family and his years at high school.
He also condemned Democrats to the committee, calling allegations against him "absolute and coordinated defamation" arranged by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed he was not in favor of Democrats.
"I think he qualifies himself in those statements and the way he denounces Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to harass Kavanaugh if he could confirm, and if Democrats get the majority in the Lower Assembly.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, that means he doesn't deserve not only the Supreme Court, but also the court he holds now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In hearings for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would revoke some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It's not time to go to court a noisy and angry person and hopefully say, 'It's not nice 'that'," Pelosi said.
And Women Need to Use It.
It's a reasonable denial, it lasts many months and years of anger, and it can't be released without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I think it's normal, right?"
She continued, "A woman executive has helped me a lot in one place, saying she also cries when she's angry, but she's done a way that when she's angry and starts crying, she'll tell the person she's talking to, "You think I'm probably sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he continued.
I think it’s good.”
Tears are allowed as a means of excruciating anger because they are first misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from my previous work, in an office dominated by men, where I cried with an unexplored outrage, was to grab me on the collar of an older woman - an angry manager that I've always been scared - and pulled me to a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy they're crying."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, has already worked in her presidential run-ups.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in flirting with his wife inside a boat called Monkey Business and retreating to the fight, Ms. Schroeder, who was really disappointed, thought that there was no reason for him not to think he would run for the presidency himself.
"The decision was not really taken seriously," he told me when he laughed 30 years later.
"There are seven candidates, and they don't need another one.
One man called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had long since begun, he had been left in fundraising, so he promised not to participate in the fight unless he could raise <0x24>2 million.
There is no ‘winner’ fight.
He found that some of his supporters who would give <0x24>1,000 to men would only give him <0x24>250.
"Do you think I'm going to talk to you?" he asked.
When he spoke and announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed with emotion - thanks to the people who supported him, disappointed with the system where it was very difficult to recruit money and target voters rather than delegates, and angered gender discrimination - so he was defeated.
"You think I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to him.
"You'd think Cleenex was the one who sponsored me.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my plate?
"He's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war will be better in Beijing
The initial explosions in the trade war between the US and China are striking, and although the conflict is far from over, Beijing can improve the conflict between countries over the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, released the first warning in the first part of this year by leasing taxes on China's major exports including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
This week's biggest increase in new tariffs affects the <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of things, which in fact imposes tax on half of all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing rewards each time, the last of which is leasing tariffs of five to ten percent to <0x24>60 billion of goods from America.
China has promised that the U.S. will be satisfied with every move, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will reach in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, it has to give up the demands, but open surrender to the US would be embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing works well, China will positively support U.S. pressures on trade war over the long term by decreasing the level of interconnection between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will initiate economic integration in any of the two countries, is more dangerous than what observers have previously admitted," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'prepared' for refugees' return, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeals for aid in the country's resurrected by more than seven years of war.
While speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
Rehabilitation is continuing in areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore everything to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left behind because of terrorism and the only vibrant economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
And six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the regime in Syria is open with the help of the rebuilding of the destroyed nation.
However, he insisted that it would not receive assistance with conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that advocated the mutation.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA in the final score of 16.5 out of 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now won six consecutive rounds in Europe and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson's tee-shot, who had difficulty throughout the tournament, fell into the water at par-3 16th hole, and received the defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari turned out in all of his rounds, and became a 1-to-4 player to have 5-0-0 since the start of the current tournament format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5<0x26>4 by the lowest ranked player in the European team, with Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have been in his last game of the Ryder Cup.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia has been the most successful in the tournament all the time in his 25.5 career point.
"I don't usually cry, but now I can't stop.
This man has become difficult.
So I'm grateful for Thomas and he chose me and he believed in me.
I was so happy to have the cup again.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to help," said Garcia, who became emotional, following the success in Europe.
He passed the duty to his fellow John Ram to beat US golf legend Tiger Woods in 2<0x26>1 in the singles game on Sunday.
"I'm really proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A unique statistic of one of the best players of all time, winning 14 major titles that only seconded Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had difficulty throughout the weekend finding fairways other than Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these people, they're fighting.
This morning, we had a little bit of trouble in Europe.
We fought.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He was a good captain.
All of his 12 players played a very good game.
We'll be together again, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 years and am honored to serve as a captain.
You're truly greeted.
They're just better."
Update on Red Tide: Concentration in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in Red Tide concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the conditions of more bloom patches are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating decreased concentration.
The Red Tide's bloom extends approximately 130 miles of coast from the counties of western Pinellas to the south of Lee.
The patches can be seen about 10 miles from Hillsborough County beach, but less area than last week.
Red Tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Average concentration in or away from Pinellas County beach last week, low to high concentration on the Hillsborough County beach, background to high concentration in Manatee County, background to high concentration on or off the Sarasota County beach, background to high concentrations
Respiratory irrigations continue to be recorded in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
No respiratory irrigation has been reported in the North West of Florida last week.
