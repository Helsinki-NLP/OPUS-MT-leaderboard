I said, uh, Tom, if someone was up to the room,
I said, Tom, if they're the ones who've ever been told to ฝรั่งเศส.
I said Tom to deliver a book.

So I guess Tom's not gonna do that.
But I guess you're not gonna be able to do anything about it.
But I thought he was ยุ่งing.

I thought Tom would ever do that.
I thought Tom was gonna be there as soon as possible.
I'm sure Tom's gonna hold him back.
I thought Tom was going to be a fool.
I thought it would be hard to believe that Tom did it on purpose.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be embarrassed by that.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be excited about that.
I think Tom's gonna be on his way.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be in love with me.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be gone.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be all right.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be up early in the morning.
I thought Tom would have been able to do it.
I think Tom's gonna be too late to do that.
So, I guess we're gonna do it today.
So I guess we're just gonna be able to prove that.
ผมสงสัยว่าเราเคยอยู่ในอันตรายใด ๆ
I'm sure you're gonna be happy with the รายงานของฉัน.
I don't think I'll do it.
I'd rather beว่ายน้ํา.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
I don't want to talk about it.
I'm doing anything about him.
I've been eating sushi when I got it.
I'm free to do my job, and I don't think I've done it.
I'm just fine.
I can't believe Tom would do anything.
Then I'd like to say, Tom's crying.
And if you're here, you're gonna be able to get out of here.
If we were to do that, we would be able to do it.
If anyone says something, I'm glad to talk to you about it.
I'm afraid it's got a little bit more to know about it.
I'm sorry, but I'm good enough for you to do it.
I'm going to do it.
It's just that I'm happy when I'm at home with my family.
I'm sorry, but I've done all I can to get to know him.
It's just that Tom's gonna cry.
It's merciless.
If I can prove that Tom did, then I'm gonna fire them.
But if I've spoken French better, then I'll do the job.
If I'dมีเวลามากกว่านี้, I'd write to you.
If I knew Tom's address, I'd write to them.
ຖ້າ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນີ້, we're gonna have to do it.
If I'm taking the place, then it's not gonna be too much.
I thought I'd never find him back there.
I thought I could be ຊ່ວຍ.
I think it's gonna be fine.
I thought they were all ຫຍຸ້ງ.
I thought Tom was going to work out again.
I thought Tom would like to know the answer.
I thought Tom was going to be hungry.
I thought we could be ຫຍຸ້ງ at the wrong time.
I thought you could know what Tom was going to be out of bed.
Well, I think theโหวตs are gonna want to change.
If I had done nothing better, I could have done it.
If I knew about it, I would have told you.
If I knew how to do it, I would do it myself.
If I ບໍ່ do it, we're going to have to do it.
Even if I had a lot of money, I'd be able to ซื้อคอมพิวเตอร์นี้ทันที.
If it's done with the พายุ, it's gonna be all right.
And if it's okay for her to ซื้อ aมีด, then why would it be ບໍ່?
But if it's gonna be okay, then I'll do it.
If it is ສໍາລັບ ดวง อาทิตย์, it's gonna be too late.
If it's possible, we can't do it if it's possible.
But if I were you, I'd say Tom to you.
If I were you, I'd be out.
But if I were you, I would've known the หมอ.
But if I were you, I'd be home once.
But if I were you, then I'd still be able to eat the mushrooms that Tom had been.
But if I were you, then you would have put the เต็นท์s on it.
But if you don't know what to do, she's gonna be okay.
If only the idea is that it's going to be out ofปาก ຂ້ອຍ just like a receipt of it.
ຖ້າ ເຈົ້າ ໄດ້ ຊ່ວຍ ຂ້ອຍ yesterday ບັນຫາ ກໍ ຈະ ຫຼີກ ລ່ຽງ ຈາກ ການ ເຮັດ ແນວ ນັ້ນ.
I've been thinking that ທຸກ ມື້ ນີ້ was theวันเกิด of Tom.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Tom.
I've been told that you've got a new assignment.
I'm willing to buy Tom a ปัจจุบัน.
I'm sorry, Tom.
I'm sorry to tell Tom that I'm meant to do that.
I found a หิน that's got the shape of a หัวใจ.
I've been looking for both Tom and Mary, just like aนิยาย.
If this sounds like a bad thing to be true, then it might be.
ຖ້າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ແທ້ ໆ ວ່າ ຈະ ເກີດ ຫຍັງ ຂຶ້ນ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ກໍ ຈະ ປ່ຽນ ແປງ ແຜນການ ຂອງ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ໄດ້.
If it's crazy, it's a way out of it.
And if Tom's down there again, tell them that I'm ຫຍຸ້ງ.
If Tom ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ that, there's probably no other way.
If Tom's in, then we're going to have to do it.
And if Tom's gonna tell you French, they're not gonna be able to do it.
If Tom ບໍ່ did it, then I'm also going to do it.
If Tom wants to know, I'm gonna keep up with you.
If Tom wants to keep you safe, I'll.
If Tom did, I would, too.
If Tom had enough money, they'd be in Boston for Mary.
If Tom is left by 2:30, they're not going to go ahead.
If Tom ບໍ່ did it, we're gonna have to do it.
If Tom ບໍ່ did it, we're gonna have to do it.
If Tom ບໍ່ did it, we're gonna have to do it.
If Tom ບໍ່ did it, we're gonna have to do it.
If Tom ບໍ່ did it, we're gonna have to do it.
If Tom's done it, we're gonna have to do it.
If Tom's done it, we're gonna have to do it.
If Tom's done it, we're gonna have to do it.
ຖ້າ ເຮົາ ບໍ່ ພົບ ນໍ້າที่เราดื่มได้ เราจะไม่รอดอีกต่อไป
ຖ້າ ເຮົາ ບໍ່ ຍອມ taking the คุกคาม of Meteor, and he's gonna have to go.
Even if we do this, Tom would have thought that he hated them.
If it's a cold, it's gonna get rid of it.
But if you're not going to be able to say it, I'm gonna let you know.
If they're not here, they're gonna be able to do a good job.
If you don't, you'll be able to do it.
But if we're not going to leave here for a little while later, we'll be fine.
ຖ້າ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄປ ຂ້ອຍ ກໍ ຈະ ບໍ່.
ຖ້າ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ທີ່ ຈະ ມາ ນີ້ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງ ເປັນ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
But if you do, I will.
ຖ້າ ເຈົ້າ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນີ້ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຮູ້ສຶກ ເສຍໃຈ ເພາະ ບໍ່ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ ສໍາລັບ ຊີວິດ ຕະຫຼອດ ໄປ.
If you're eating it, then I'm going to eat it, too.
But if you've been able to find out what you're saying, I'm not going to be able to say it.
But if we've been ตาม ຄໍາ ແນະນໍາ ຂອງ ຂ້ອຍ, we're not going to be able to help you.
If we want to protect Tom, he's gonna be fine.
But if you ever tell me, I'm gonna be ໃສ່ with you.
ຖ້າ ເຈົ້າ ມີ ຄໍາ ຖາມ, please come up here.
But if you're not from me, I'm going to go too far.
If you're here, then you're not going to be able to do it.
If you're going to be here, then you're not going to be either.
ຖ້າ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ເຕັມ ໃຈ ເຮັດ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເຮົາ ບອກ ໃຫ້ ເຮັດ, ອອກ ຈາກ ນັ້ນ.
And if you see Tom that ທຸກ ມື້ ນີ້, please tell them that he's เชิญ himself to theปาร์ตี้, too.
But if you're not in the pen, I'll let you know.
But if you are not going to leave, you can.
I've given Tom aจักรยาน.
ผมให้เงินทอมทั้งหมดที่ผมมี
I've got aจักรยาน for Tom.

I guess I'm going to say it too.
I guess it's just that it's just as if he did it.
I think it's important.
I guess you can do that.
So I guess this is going to be a step over the other side.
Well, I guess we still need to keep looking at Tom as soon as possible.
I guess you can do that.
I've always had a hard start when it ເລີ່ມ ฝน.
I've been hoping that you'll never tell me everything else.
I mean, I was determined to visit the ວິຫານ last week.

It's a big deal.
It's a home drippy.
It's a transcend to the United States to be สูญ เสีย ຊາຍ ຫນຸ່ມ and ຍິງ.
It's just a cat.
มันเป็นเมืองที่น่าตื่นเต้น, New York.
It's a pity that you've been able to come up with him.
It's a pity that you can stop him.
It is a ສິດທິ ພິເສດ that we may not be able to do so.
I'm sorry, but I don't have to worry about it.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ ພະອົງ ກໍາລັງ ຢູ່ ເຮືອນ.
It's Friday.
It's going to take a lot of time.
It's getting dark out of the door.
It's gonna be late.
It's been a matter of fact, but it's not a matter of fact.
It's been anticipation.
It is not always easy to understand.
It will be easier for you to take care of the ชั่ว.
It is not like a watch.
It's gonna be okay to say a ພາສາ ອັງກິດ.
The Bible says: “The one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly. ”
It's been raining.
It is not until it comes to the end of this system of things.
This is the only way to do this is to make sure that it is necessary for you to share your faith with others.
It's not like a bug. It's a punctured.
You know, it's gonna be like a real thing to do.
It's gonna be as bad as it's going to sound.
I want you to understand that you've been ຂຽນ the letter.
You know, it's gonna be cool, but you're gonna do it anyway.
It ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ສໍາລັບ ຂ້ອຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ໄວ້ ວາງໃຈ ຄົນ ອື່ນ.
It ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ຄວາມ ຮູ້ສຶກ ຂອງ ຄົນ ອື່ນ.
It's not as bad as theโรงแรม.
It's all right to startners.
It's not gonna hurt.
It's fine to เยาะ เย้ย the man in theสาธารณะ.
It's hard.
It's just that it's all right.
I don't think Tom's gonna be talking to him about how he's done.
It's not like Tom's gonna be going over.
It's just that it's hard to do it.
I don't want to do that.
I don't want to have Tom to do that by myself.
It ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ໃຫ້ ເຮົາ ເຂົ້າ ຮ່ວມ ການ ບັນລະຍາຍ ນີ້.
It ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ໃຫ້ ເຮົາ ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ ໃນ ຕອນ ນີ້.
It ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ໃຫ້ ເຈົ້າ ມາ ຢູ່ ນີ້ ອີກ ຕໍ່ ໄປ.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm sorry to be too late to see you.
It's not like that.
It ບໍ່ ສໍາຄັນ ແທ້ ໆ.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
It ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ສາມາດพลาด ໄດ້.
มันไม่ใช่ความคิดของทอม, it's me.
It may be that Tom is not doing that.
It's done.
It's all right.
It's not gonna work for theกล้อง.
It does not feel like going down there.
He said that he knew theความลับ.
It's gonna be fine.
It's aวันอาทิตย์.
It's like they're supposed to have a couple of houses in the United States.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too late for them.
It's too late for me.
It's true that I'm an elder.
It is true that the earth isรอบ.
It's not like she's got to show me the way.
It's not worth it.
It's gonna be hard to figure out what's going on.
It's gonna be done by the way it's done.
It's gonna be hard for Tom to do that.
It's gonna be hard for Tom to win.
It's gonna be impossible to do that.
It's gonna take more than 1 ชั่วโมง to be there.
Take it as if it's going to rain.
I don't think it's gonna be a matter of fact, but I don't think it's okay.
I don't think they're going to need a copy of the book.
I don't think Tom's gonna wait for his own.
It does.
ອາດ ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ເລື່ອງ ຍາກ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ຄື ກັບ ທີ່ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ມັນ ຈະ ເປັນ.
ອາດ ເປັນ ໄປ ໄດ້ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
This ອາດ ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ສໍາລັບ ເຈົ້າ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ຕາມ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຄໍາພີ ໄບ ເບິນ ບອກ ໄວ້.
This ອາດ ເປັນ ເລື່ອງ ຍາກ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
It's not something I'm going to have to do with you.
It's not gonna be too late for the shipping.
It can be difficult for Tom to do that.
It's not worth it.
I told Tom that I was in ออสเตรเลีย.
I told Tom that they're not supposed to be coming out.
I told Tom that they're supposed to be cool.
I told Tom that they're supposed to be cool.
I told Tom that I'd beร้องเพลง.
I told Tom that I've done this because I'mป่วย.
I told Tom that I ບໍ່ ຢາກร้องเพลง.
I told Tom that I found it.
I told Tom that you're not going to be in ออสเตรเลีย.
I told Tom that you're not going to be in ออสเตรเลีย.
I told Tom that he was ยุ่งing.
I told Tom that he was หิว.
I told you I'd love to know if Tom would tell the truth or not.
I told him he was supposed to wait for Tom.
I've got to tell you that Tom's not gonna be able to give up on his own.
I'm just saying it's a birthday to Tom.
I was just remembering that ທຸກ ມື້ ນີ້ was the birthday of Tom.
It's been raining for three days.
I was trying to convince Tom how to do that, but he said that they ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ.
I ພະຍາຍາມ ເຮັດ ທຸກ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ໄດ້ ເພື່ອ ເຊົາ Tom.
I've been trying to kill myself twice.
ผม พยายาม เกลี้ยกล่อม ทอม ให้ มา ออสเตรเลีย กับ เรา แต่ ລາວ ບອກ ວ່າ ລາວ ມີ ສິ່ງ ອື່ນ ໆ ທີ່ ລາວ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I'm sure that's what you're doing.
It's 2:30.
It's aต่อรอง.
It's a day to sleep!
It's about the time we're on it!
It's a disaster.
It's poisonous!
It's been a matter of fact that Tom did that.
It's a good thing that Tom left the door open.
It's gonna be okay.
It's only a birthday of ours.
It's a อัศจรรย์!
It's a อัศจรรย์ to the house that's got to be treated with aแผ่นดินไหว.
It's a อัศจรรย์ that Tom's been on the street.
It's a lot of fun, Tom.
It's a สงสาร that he wants to visit Tom when he's got a chance.
It's a secret, so please ບໍ່บอกใคร.
It's a shame that you'll be there for him.
It's gonna be hard for me to walk away.
It's been a long time since we were taught.
It's been a while since I told you that I ຮັກ you.
It's been ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ.
It's been done before.
It's up to me.
It's gonna happen to me if you don't want to know what to do.
It's gonna happen to me if you don't want to know what to do.
It's gonna happen to me if you don't want to know what to do.
It's gonna happen to me if you don't want to know what to do.
It's gonna happen to me if you don't want to know what to do.
It's hard to know how important it is for you to know that you are not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຢູ່ ໃນ ຫມູ່ ບ້ານ.
I don't think it's like Tom and Mary do it for me.
I don't think it's like Tom doesn't even know what he's doing.
ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ລາວ ຕ້ອງ ພະຍາຍາມ ຫຼາຍ ແທ້ ໆ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ວຽກ ຫນັກ ເພື່ອ ເຮັດ ໃຫ້ ສາຍ ສໍາພັນ ຂອງ ລາວ ກັບ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ ແຫນ້ນ ແຟ້ນ ຫຼາຍ ຂຶ້ນ.
Take it both Tom and Mary, just like a ดนตรีคลาสสิก.
I don't think Tom is going to be able to speak to you.
ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ມີ ເວລາ ທີ່ ຈະ ລົມ ກັບ ພີ່ ນ້ອງ ຄ ລິດ ສະ ຕຽນ ໃນ ສະຕະວັດ ທໍາອິດ.
ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ເຄີຍ.
ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຢູ່ ໃນ.
ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ໄດ້ ເຫັນ ຄົນ ນັ້ນ ຢູ່ ທີ່ ນັ້ນ who's beenใส่แว่นs for a while.
It's enough to drive you out!
It's gonna be hard to do.
It's gonna be hard for you to find someone to replace Tom.
It's gonna be impossible for us to find someone to take the lead in the house.
It's gonna be hard to do that.
It's gonna be hard for us to find someone to replace Tom.
It's been a matter of fact, Tom's probably done that.
It's hard to believe that Tom is only 13 years old.
It's hard to be aกระต่าย with a มือเปล่า.
It's hard to do it, isn't it?
It's hot.
No, it's gonna be impossible for you to do it.
It's important that you do it very well.
It's impossible to believe that it's gonna happen.
It's only 20 years old.
It's anticipation.
It smells like they've been สูบ บุหรี่ in their mouths.
It's just as much as you can imagine.
It's just one!
It's not a matter of fact that it's worth it.
It's not a big deal.
It ບໍ່ does.
It's like a cat. It's aหมา.
It's like a computer.
It's gonna be a hard time.
มันไม่ใช่ความคิดที่ดีที่จะถามผู้หญิงว่า เธอแก่แค่ไหน
It's not like the idea of reflexing theรหัสผ่านs.
No, it's not. It's like a joke.
You know, it's gonna be okay to tell me that you want to be a good man.
It can be used to eat well when you're traveling to the top of the earth.
No, it's going to be a solution.
It's announcing.
It's gonna be as bad as it's gonna sound.
It's not as cold as I can imagine it's gonna be.
It's not as cold as it was yesterday.
It's not as crazy as it sounds.
This is probably the same as the one who ຄິດs.
It's not like aความลับ anymore.
It's not like a bad idea.
It's not as hot as I can imagine.
It's not as sweet as it was yesterday.
It's like a toy.
It's a very good time.
I want you to understand that where you're going to do it.
มันไม่ชัดเจนเลยว่าใครอยู่เบื้องหลังการโจมตี
It's not available.
It's got to be deep enough.
ຍັງ ບໍ່ ທັນ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ.
It's gonna be okay to be ແຕ່ງ ດອງ by Tom.
It's gonna be impossible for you, isn't it?
It ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ຄວາມ ຮູ້ສຶກ ຂອງ ຄົນ ອື່ນ.
It's gonna be cool to find out how quickly it's done.
มันไม่พอที่จะรู้เพียงภาษาเดียว
It's gonna be nice.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's going to be done.
It's not going to be as hard as I thought it would be.
It ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
It's gonna be impossible for us to find someone to take the lead in the house.
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ ອີກ.
It's gonna work out.
It's gonna be fine for anyone.
It's hard to remember what's going on.
It's just that it's okay to eat and run.
It's not going to be healthy to skip it.
It ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຫມາຍ ຄວາມ ວ່າ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
It's like a little bit of a good time.
It's like Tom's fault.
It's like Tom's ปัญหา.
I don't want to do it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
It's like I've been trying to avoid Tom.
I mean, it's not like Tom's gonna be the one who's gonna be able to help him get away with it.
I mean, it's not like Tom's gonna be the one who's gonna be able to say that he's gonna be a part of the world.
I don't think it's going to be any longer than I thought it's gonna be.
It's probably the same thing as ฝน พรุ่งนี้.
It's like he's doing something.
It's like he's gonna be a ແຕ່ງ ດອງ or something.
I feel like I'm going to do something else.
It ບໍ່ ຄື ກັບ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແນວ ໃດ.
It's not a business.
It's fine to hit the man.
It's okay to smoke it.
It's open to the interrogation.
It's going to be over until the lady'sอ้วนร้องเพลงs.
This is possible.
It's not going to work.
It's not safe for you to drink from the glass of it.
It ບໍ່ ມີ ເຫດຜົນ.
It's like an วิทยาศาสตร์จรวด.
It's not safe to ดื่ม น้ํา.
It's not safe to be late for me.
มันไม่ปลอดภัยที่จะส่งข้อความ ขณะคุณขับ
It's not safe.
It's like snowing.
It ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຜູ້ ຄົນ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ໄດ້.
Doesn't want to be sad about it.
It's like I'm fine.
I think it's gonna be okay.
I think it's gonna be okay.
It's something I'm not gonna say.
It's something I'm not gonna say.
มันไม่ใช่สิ่งที่ฉันสามารถตัดสินใจได้อย่างรวดเร็ว
It's something that I'm trying to get out of here.
It's something that I'm doing well.
I think it's gonna be okay.
It's supposed to be fun.
It's been a long time.
It's like a แปลก, isn't it?
มันไม่ใช่เป้าหมายสุดท้าย, แต่กระบวนการที่จะไปถึงที่นั่น
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
It's not worth it.
It's gonna be hard.
It's too สาย to say Tom.
It's too สาย to ປ່ຽນ theตาราง.
I'm afraid it's too late to tell you.
He's gone to the hospital.
It's not going to be great.
It's probably too bad to ฝน พรุ่งนี้.
It's not the ลม that's up to you.
-I don't think so. -I don't know.
มันไม่ใช่สิ่งที่คุณพูดนั้น แต่วิธีที่คุณพูด
It's like to say yes.
It's not worth it.
It's worth the effort.
It's right.
ไม่ใช่คุณ, ฉันเอง!
This is a good idea.
I mean, I can't believe Tom would do that if he wanted to.
I mean, I mean, I'm sorry.
I mean, it's a good idea, Tom.
I mean, it's not like Tom's gonna be a good guy.
I mean, it's a good idea, Tom's not doing it.
It's okay to be a แปลก.
It's okay to beโกรธed by the people who're trying to hurt me.
It's okay to lie to the original authorities.
This sounds like a man who's been crying.
This is possible.
It's possible that Tom's in the way he's going to be when he's a boy.
It's possible that Tom was in the way he was old.
It's possible that Tom might like to know where I'm going.
It's probably gonna be hard for Tom to win.
It's not like Tom's gonna come.
It's raining the cats and the สุนัข.
It's ฝน, it's been raining, 'cause it's been good for the first time in the day.
It's hot! It's summer!
It ບໍ່ ສໍາຄັນ ແທ້ ໆ.
It ບໍ່ ສໍາຄັນ ແທ້ ໆ.
It's a ข่าวลือ that Tom and Mary have been decorated.
It's like you've heard something from Tom.
It's like we've got a lot of time to hear about what's going on.
It's the type of thing Tom would do.
It's time to think about the past.
It's time to ล้าง a funk, Tom. คุณเหม็น.
It's Tom Mary.
It's Tom Mary.
It's Tom's thirth birthday tomorrow.
It's been bad for you to find out what's going on.
It's darker than it is.
It's a bad day that's how it works.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that.
It's going to be okay.
This is probably going to be easy to get what Swinges say.
It's aลม, but it's gonna be cold.
It's way through the day Tom promised he'd go on.
It's nothing Tom's gonna do.
It's my fault. I'm crippled.
It's been so long before I could.
I'mปิดing my computer.
I'mปิดing the light.
I'll get the คอมพิวเตอร์ off.
This is a good time to get to know how to do it.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom wants to know that he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ ทอม ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ລາວ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ແທ້ ໆ.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom wants to know that he's the one who's been doing that.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom meant to do that yesterday.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom also ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ that.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ ทอม ຍັງ ບໍ່ วนเวียนรอบๆ เพื่อทําแบบนั้น
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom's not going to do that by myself.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ ทอม ตั้งใจ แน่ว แน่ จะ ทํา เช่น นั้น.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom was expecting him to do that.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom's gonna do that.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom's gonna do that by Mary.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom was supposed to know that he had done it.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary that she ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary how to do that.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom was the one who was supposed to ບອກ Mary to do that.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
It's hard to do that until Tom said it would be.
It's hard for Tom to say that they're not.
It's just a joke.
* (See footnote.)
ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ປະສົບການ ທີ່ ດີ ຫຼາຍ.
มันไม่ชัดเลยว่าใครอยู่เบื้องหลังการโจมตี
It's hard to find aรองเท้า that'sพอดี.
Notice that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that.
Notice that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກร้องเพลง.
That's what Tom's been doing.
It's snowing ມື້ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ເກີດ.
It was the first time I met the museum.
It's Uncle Ar who's been taking the lead.
It's gonna be hot.
It's going to be annoyance.
It's just a few minutes later.
The Bible tells us this way: “Do not be afraid.
The Bible says: “Do not be afraid or be terrified.
It's going to be a matter of fact, but it's gonna take you to the point.
It's only possible for a man to be able to do whatever's right in his eyes.
It's gonna take 20 minutes to get the สถานี by theแท็กซี่.
It ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ສໍາລັບ ເຮົາ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
It's gonna be hard to do that.
It can be fun.
It can be hard for you to bear.
It would be better if he were to be gone.
It can't be fun to do that.
It's gonna be hard to do that.
It's gonna be interesting to do that.
It's gonna be aโรแมนติค to do that.
It's gonna be a lot of work to do.
It would be wise to do that.
It's gonna be fine to do that.
I ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ເຮົາ ຊ່ວຍ.
ข้าเคยคิดว่าเจ้าเจ๋ง
I've always had a body of a launderette.
I've lost aปากกา that I ซื้อ yesterday.
I've done it before, man.
I've promised Tom I'm not going to talk to him.
I said I'm going to do that.
I told Tom that I didn't want them to do that.
I told Tom that I had to do that.
I told Tom that I'd like to do it.
I've been to ออสเตรเลีย every summer since I was thirteen.
I've been looking forward to it!
I've been able to do that for months.
I've been telling you that you're a ช่างไม้ที่ดี.
I've been telling you that you've been in French for a while.
I've been telling you that you're going to find a babysitter.
I've been telling you that you're going to find an ເບິ່ງ ແຍງ.
I told you I'd find a นั่งster.
I've been ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ to do that again.
I've done everything I've learned to do.
I've done everything I've said to do.
I've done that ຫຼາຍ ຄັ້ງ.
I've done it before.
I've enjoyed telling you.
I've got something to write about.
I'm done with เรเดียน.
I've heard that infiltrate is a little fun.
I've been thinking about the girl who's a little girl in the world who's going to live in Australia.
I heard Tom left Mary.
I've heard that the woman's been living in aรองเท้ามากกว่าผู้ชาย.
I've heard that you're a liar.
I've heard the woman's presence in theรองเท้าs more than the man did.
I've been through.
I've lost three kilos.
I've made aกาแฟให้เรา
I've ever been toปารีส.
I've been in love with someone.
I've never heard of Tom squealing at me.
I've never met someone who's ever been like me.
I've never seen Tom hit someone.
I've built a lot of cars on my way over there, and we're gonna need to call them.
I promised Tom that I would do that.
I've promised Tom that I've been going to ออสเตรเลีย for them.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't think I'm gonna have a chance to be happy for you.
I don't think I'm going to be able to help you, but I don't know what I'm talking about.
I'm not here for Tom to go to the hospital.
I'm not gonna hear about it.
I don't know if Tom and Mary were eating meat or not.
I don't know if Tom and Mary were to do that, either.
I don't want to know what to do.
I don't know what Tom's up to.
I don't know what Tom is about to do.
I don't know who's going to be in the truth.
I don't know what to do with Tom.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
It's just that I think I'm gonna be too late for the bus.
So I'm the one who's been thinking about it.
It's just that Tom's gonna kill me.
I'm an idiot to restore to Tom.
I'm ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I was told to do something that I didn't want to do.
ຂ້ອຍ ດີ ໃຈ ຫຼາຍ ທີ່ ເຫັນ ทอม.
I was hoping it was a joke.
I was hoping that you and I would be able to do it this afternoon.
I'm just about to call you, but you beat me against it.
I'm only hoping that you're gonna be able to do it.
I'm so busy, Tom said that he wanted to know how to do it.
I'm just so busy when Tom said he'd like to be one of the most important things to him.

I've been walking in Boston when I was 13 years old.
I've been working on it.
It's been a lot of fun, but it's not like it's been a matter of time.
I'll be fine if I don't know what to do.
I'd be as หิว as Tom.
I'd be as if I had to, like, as Tom did.
I'm trying to find someone who's watching me.
I'm trying to find someone who's watching me.
I'm trying to figure out how many people are watching me.
I don't know what to do with Tom.
I've been trying to find out what Tom might have done.
I've been trying to find out what Tom might have done.
I don't know what to do. I'm trying to get Tom to do that.
I've been working on it.
I've been thinking about how much I want you to do it.
It's been a while since Tom did it.
It's a lot of fun. I'm sorry, Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I've been trying to help you.
I'd like to tell you what to do when Tom told me that he'd do it.
I was ຕົກໃຈ ເມື່ອ ໄດ້ ຍິນ ວ່າ Tom was being จับ.
I'm ຕື່ນ ເຕັ້ນ ແທ້ ໆ. I'm never gonna eat anything.
I'm so excited!
I was so busy that Tom knew how to do that.
I was so busy that Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ຄື ກັບ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.

I was so busy that Tom ບໍ່ was the only one who had to do what he was supposed to do.

I was so busy when I heard that Tom had committed suicide.
I was so busy when Tom told me that he ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
I was so busy when Tom told me that he was not doing that.
I'm the only one who used to know that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I'm the only one who knows that Tom is not doing that.
One of them says, "It's not a matter of fact that it's not a matter of fact.
I'm shyer when I'm old.
I'm ໃສ່ ໃສ່ ໃສ່ aสูท, but I'm not gonna need a tie.
I'm tweeting myself.
I'll do it as well as I can.
I'll be able to see Tom in an explanation.
I'm going to be ຫຍຸ້ງ in a week.
I'm going to be inบอสตัน until Monday afternoon.
I'm gonna be a สั้น.
I'll speak to you tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna check on Tom.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm going to draw the other side of the field.
I'm going to go to prison for you.
I'll never be able to kill the กฎหมาย again.
I'd love to visit Tom again.
I'm still going to be ຫຍຸ້ງ in the afternoon.
I'll be able to get home if it's too good to go.
I'm gonna take you out of the car ใหม่.
I'm going to speak to you later.
I'm going to need to keep this in mind when I'm done.
I'm going to visit Tom.
He's not gonna be able to do anything about it.
ฉันหวังว่าฉันจะไปคอนเสิร์ตกับคุณ
I don't think I can say ฝรั่งเศส.
ฉันหวังว่าฉันจะกอดคุณ
I don't think I'll tell you aภาษาอังกฤษ as well as I do!
I don't think I'll be able to say ฝรั่งเศส as well as I do.
I don't think I can say ฝรั่งเศส, either by Tom.
Doesn't seem to be able to do it myself.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to tell Tom.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to visit ออสเตรเลีย.
I don't think I've been born in a cat.
I don't think I'll be able to say anything.
Doesn't mean that I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it.
Doesn't seem like I'd never have told Tom anything about it.
I'm afraid I'm gonna be able to help you.
I don't think I'm gonna do it.
I don't think I'm good to have a drink.
I don't think it's true.
I don't think I'm better than ฝรั่งเศส.
I don't think I'm coming back to you!
I don't think I'm gonna be alone with you.
I don't think I'm the other person.
I'm afraid I'm going to be the other person.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it.
Doesn't seem to have a lot of money in the world, but I don't think that's what the rest of the world's lives are.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't think it's possible.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to get a lot of weight and I'll get it out of here.
ฉันหวังว่าฉันจะช่วยคุณได้มากกว่านี้
ฉันหวังว่าฉันคงไม่ต้องโยนมันทิ้ง
I don't think I'm going to be one of them.
I'm afraid I'm willing to buy theไข่.
ฉันหวังว่าฉันจะดีในการพูดคุยกับผู้หญิง as Tom was.
I'm afraid I've been at Tom's back to Australia.
ฉันหวังว่าฝรั่งเศสของฉันจะดีเท่าคุณ
I'm afraid Tom was one of those.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna want to be a noisy.
I'm afraid you're willing to do it.
ผมหวังว่าคุณจะไม่ได้เห็นผมทําแบบนั้น
I don't think Tom's gonna believe me.
ฉันหวังว่าเราจะอยู่ในออสเตรเลียอีกอาทิตย์
I don't think he's going to be a part of the world.
Doesn't matter what I said to you.
Doesn't mean that you're never gonna tell me.
Doesn't mean that you're not talking about it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Doesn't even seem to be able to tell me that.
Doesn't matter if you tell me anything else.
Doesn't seem like he's gonna be able to get home.

Couldn't you see a picture that I've been doing in Boston?
Would you mind if I cut off the radio?
Let me write a few questions down.
Ya hafta smells roses.
Yay.
Yay.
Did you know Tom's gonna do that, huh?
You and I both know that it ບໍ່ true.
You and me both know that Tom is not doing that.
You're aอัจฉริยะ.
You're a good boy.
I'm going to be ຫຍຸ້ງ up as a bee.
You must love the words of this one.
You're a moron.
I'm not going to be as tall as my sister.

Let's do this again.
You can't do it by 5:00.
You're ອິດ ສະຫຼະ ທີ່ ຈະ ໃຊ້รถนี้.
They're gonna be fine.
This is a good time to get out of here.

It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
You're supposed to smoke it.
คุณไม่ได้กลัวผีs, huh?

It's a danger.
You're the ones who're the ones who're making up for you.
I'm the only one who can do this.
I'm the only one.
You're a bitเหนื่อย, aren't you?
I am going to blame you.
It's just a matter of time.
I've seen TV before.
I'm going to see.
They're ໃສ່ ໃສ່เสื้อs inside.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna go get dressed.
You're the one who's going to get the job.

Let's see if we can get out of here.
You're going to want to keep it straight until you read it.
You can't afford to buy one of those things in the next 30 dollars.
You can't say that Tom's going to be a whirlwind.
You can imagine it's gonna be hard for Tom.
You can't kick me around any more.
You're gonna let us know that I'm right here.
You're gonna be born without the water.
You can do this to yourself.

You can beจมน้ําตาย.
We could just tell us.
You can do that for yourself.
You could've gone.
All right, let me know that you're gonna be late.
We could have told you, if we always told me that I'm ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ going to make it up.
Maybe we can tell from the past.
You can tell me.
You're gonna have to hope it's gonna take place.
All right, let's go.

What do you want to do?
We've got a chance.
คุณไม่จําเป็นต้องรอทอม เขาจะไม่มา
คุณไม่รู้ว่ามันยากแค่ไหนสําหรับทอม.
What do you think Tom's been สงสัย, right?
I still thought it was gonna be late for Tom.
That's what I'm saying.
You got aองุ่น?
All right, let's do this to you.
We're gonna have to talk to Tom about that.
We got a little bit of a humour.
I've changed my life.
You've been ປ່ຽນn since I saw you in the last year.
You're working out your father's work.
You've done a lot of questions, haven't you?
You've loved it.

Did you know that Tom was the one who wanted to do it?
Did you know that Tom told me that he's gonna do that, right?
Did you know Tom was aเต้น ballet, right?
Did you know Tom would be able to do it as quickly as Mary did?

You know, I ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຫມາຍ ຄວາມ ວ່າ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
You know, I need a ride.
You know, I'm not the only one who's ever been able to do it.
You know, I'm fine with the light.
You know, I'm older than I am.
You know, it's not like that.
You know, I'm not gonna say anything.
You know, I can't do that.
That's why I'm going to do this.
That's what I was supposed to do today, isn't it?
You know, I'm the one who's got to do it, right?
This is the only way to get to know the truth.
You know, I'm gonna do this to you.

It's gonna be a hard time.
They're gonna be the same.
I'm going to see you ຫຍຸ້ງ.
Look, I'm just going to look at this.
Look, I don't think he's gonna be able to do anything.
ເຈົ້າ ອາດ ເຊີນ ຄົນ ຫນຶ່ງ ທີ່ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງການ.
ເຈົ້າ ອາດ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນີ້ ໄດ້ ອີກ ບໍ່ ດົນ.
We're gonna be able to make sure that you're in the middle of the floor if you're not.
We must keep it from beingท้าย in the year.
They're going to stop smoking.
We've been working for the last year.
We don't need to hear anything about it.
That's what we're going to do.
I've never told you how much you want to do to be a part of the world.
It should be the most important thing in your life.
The Bible says: “We have come to know the truth, but we are not afraid of it. ”
They should have told Tom that he would do that.
คุณควรบอกทอม how he's planning to beว่ายน้ํา.
You're going crazy.
I'm still looking forward to it.
I'm sure it's important to be responsive to me.
You promised that you'd do that.
I'm a binocular binocular.
You're a little bit younger than Tom, aren't you?
I'm a compulsive บ่นer.
I'm a little bit of a lot of money.
I'm a drug addict, just like me!

You're gonna pay for it.
You're fucked up.
You'reหล่อ.
You're in aห้องสมุด.
She's been in theห้องสมุด.
That's a good time.
That's a good time.
You'reโกหก!
I'm going to have a bad idea.
She's a hero, Sami.
They're going to have to believe it.
You're never going to get it!
คุณไม่ใช่ผู้หญิงในเมือง, huh?
คุณไม่ได้แนะนําว่า ผมออกไปกับผู้หญิงคนอื่นใช่มั้ย?
You're allowed to record it.
You're allowed to smoke.
You're going to be a fool.
It's not gonna be like Tom.
They're going to get out of here.
- You're the one who's got to be the one who's ever seen.
You're going to be a fool of me, Tom.
คุณไม่ได้มาจากที่นี่, huh?
You're gonna get away with me that ง่าย, Tom.
คุณจะไม่ยอมแพ้ใช่ไหม?
คุณจะไม่ทิ้งผมไว้ที่นี่ใช่ไหม?
You're gonna let Tomว่ายน้ํา, aren't you?
คุณไม่มีโชคมากใช่มั้ย?
We're just gonna do it to Tom.
I'm sorry, but I don't know.
- You're looking at him.
คุณจะไม่ทําอย่างนั้นจริงๆใช่มั้ย?
คุณไม่ได้วางแผนที่จะถ่ายรูป, right?
คุณไม่ได้วางแผนจะช่วยทอม, right?
They're gonna be right for Tom anymore.
ເຈົ້າ ຍັງ ບໍ່ ຢ້ານ, right?
คุณไม่ได้แนะนําทอม to do that, right?
- [Grunts] - [Grunts] - [Grunts]
That's what Tom said.
คุณไม่ใช่ทอม, right?
- What's wrong with you? - Yeah.
It's not like she's getting involved in it.
คุณไม่ได้ห่วงเรื่องการทดสอบ, huh?
That's all you're about to go to พรุ่งนี้, right?
You're pulling theขา.
- You're the one who's going to be a ทูต!
You're hot!
You're gay.
I'm up to you.
You're a snuck.
She's the first person who's ever been in love with.
We're the only ones who know who's got a fire.
I'm not exactly the same as I am.
You're annoying.
You're welcome.
microphones are on.
It's a lot of money.
The world's not going to need any attention.
I said, "You're not going to know me."
I think this may seem to be the one who's willing to do it.
You're an astronomer.
You're supposed to be ฉลอง!
คุณควรมาแต่เช้า เพื่อให้เขาอ่านสคริปต์ของคุณก่อนการพูด
อย่างน้อยคุณควรบอกทอมและ Mary that ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ອີກ.
Should we be able to keep our relationship with Jehovah strong?
She's supposed to be turned away by her father.
I'm supposed to be careful of the veneration of my เตือนs when I'm at the same time.
คุณควรจะฟังคํา เตือนของฉัน เมื่อคุณมีโอกาส.
That should be true if we want to make a vow to Jehovah.
Should we be at least thinking about it?
We should be able to make a call.
Shouldn't you tell me for a moment?
Shouldn't you get the car?
ເຈົ້າ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ວຽກ ຫນັກ ເພື່ອ ເຮັດ ໃຫ້ ສາຍ ສໍາພັນ ຂອງ ເຈົ້າ ກັບ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ ແຫນ້ນ ແຟ້ນ ຂຶ້ນ.
Shouldn't you write it down?
It should be said to Tom that he must do it by himself.
I'm supposed to keep ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ we need to do Tom's job.
This is one of the most valuable things you have ever learned.
We're supposed to assume that Tom is a guilty man.
They're supposed to be the bronze of the อื่น.
คุณควรใส่วงเล็บรอบประโยคนี้.
Shouldn't you say it as soon as you can?
