She's not like a cook.
Tom said he'd be in a hurry.
I know Tom wants to know who he's doing.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณไม่ใช่แคนาดา.
Come on, watch me play a minute.
Tom said they knew what Mary ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
Tom said that Mary was ยุ่งing to this day.
Tom told me he's gonna cry out about that.
Tom's a member of the co-op house.
Tom drives down the street where Mary lives, hoping to see her.
ผมแน่ใจว่ามันไม่ได้ยากที่จะทําอย่างนั้น
You know, as long as I do, Tom will do it.
Tom wants to be sure that he's supposed to beจูบ Mary หรือ ไม่, so he wants to.
I think Tom might be doing that by myself.
Tom ເບິ່ງ ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ແນວ ໃດ ກັບ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຄວນ ເຮັດ.
It's gonna be a lot of work to do.
Tom's got to tell you the truth.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary was supposed to do that.
ເຮົາ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ບາງ ຢ່າງ ເພື່ອ ຈະ ໄດ້ ຮັບ ຄວາມ ລອດ.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he ບໍ່ ເຊື່ອ Mary has determined to do this week.
Tom knows he's gonna be punished.
I don't think I've seen anyone do that before.
นั่น ບໍ່ ຍາກ.
ผมเกรงว่าเราไม่มีเหลือ
Tom told me that I'm supposed to be able to play the กลองs.
We're not going to be able to do this.
I've ever been toปารีส.
Tom says he's been eating something, but he wants to be true.
I'm an accomplice.
Tom said Mary was at home in a cold room.
I thought Tom had the idea to do it.
Tom said Mary knew she was gonna do that on her own.
Tom told me he thought Mary was in a painter.
Tom said they're not gonna be good to do that to you.
Tom said I'm looking at a littleซีy.
Tom told Mary that she should be quitting himself to beสับสน.
Tom thought Mary was the only one.
I know Tom's gonna hide something from me.
Did you know that Tom's start to playกีตาร์ until he's thirty-year-old?
I thought Tom knew that Mary was not doing that.
I'm ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom's gonna be there.
I don't think Tom would like to know where Mary was when she was born on the 20th.
I know that Tom is the only one who wants to do it.
ເປັນ ຫຍັງ ທຸກ ຄົນ ຈຶ່ງ look at you?
I know Tom wants to know who it is for Mary.
I'm the reason Tom did that is because he's the other man in the ครอบครัว.
They're just trying to find out what they're doing.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was trying to find out how to play the oboe.
ผมอยากจะ ໃຊ້ ໂອກາດ ນີ້ ເພື່ອ ຂອບໃຈ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ.
I'll be there all day unless I do.
I know that I'm the one who keeps doing that before Tom is on my way.
I think you're not gonna be able to do that.
Tom also wants to talk to Mary about that.
I don't think Tom's gonna beหล่อ.
Tom's the only one who's been นอน.
Tom said he thought Mary was used to be.
I've never been able to let you go.
I think I'm gonna be able to do the same thing tomorrow.
Tom said he'd be able to do the same thing.
Tom told me he thought Mary was an Autic.
Tom's not gonna be able to go to Boston for him.
I know that Tom's gonna be able to do more than Mary.
I know Tom's gonna be able to make a living up to me.
Tom said that they ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ທີ່ ຈະ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເປັນ ຫຍັງ ເຮົາ ຈຶ່ງ it.
But I thought you'd be expecting Tom to be one of the newนักร้องs.
Tom said he's too late.
Tom said, "ผมไม่ต้องทําอย่างนั้นตอนบ่าย."
Tom said it's a good time to leave.
I know Tom's กลัว.
You're going to want to keep it straight until you read it.
I really thought I did.
Tom's never been there for days.
The Bible does not say whether it is true or not.
It's an accomplice!
Tom said he thought Mary was really open.
Tom said he didn't have to.
You can't afford to buy one of those things in the next 30 dollars.
Do you think Tom's not going to be one of them?
Tom said he didn't have a big deal with Mary.
I know what Tom wants to do.
Tom's not gonna see him do that.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be วิ่ง over to the President.
Tom should've done it yesterday.
Tom's probably gonna beโกรธing.
Tom said Mary was never going to be mad.
I know that Tom ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ເຮົາ ເຮັດ ດ້ວຍ ຕົວ ເອງ.
Tom said he's got to be a lot of kids.
I know that Tom is the only one who wants to do it.
I hope you've always heard of me.
Tom said that Mary was trying to understand that she ອາດ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I think Tom's gonna beโกรธing.
ฉันนึกว่าคุณชอบนิยายรักs.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary are getting bored.
Tom told me about the ปัญหา.
I know Tom's the one who's the one who's been snoring.
ผมไม่รู้จักใครที่เกลียดทอม.
Tom said he thought I could win.
Three years ago, I was inบอสตัน.
I don't think I can do what Tom's doing.
ເປັນ ຫຍັງ ຈຶ່ງ ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຟັງ ຂ້ອຍ?
Soldier ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ ຂ້ອຍ.
Tom said he thought I seemed to be ປະທັບ.
Tom said he's got an object to the next day.
It's all right to startners.
Tom and Mary told me that they were going to do it.
I think Tom wants to know how toว่ายน้ํา.
Tomมีเพื่อนมากมายที่นี่.
Tom knows he's cheating.
I think Tom was a member of the club.
Where's the sniper?
I don't think I'm gonna be as early as I was.
I don't think Tom's gonna be talking to him about how he's done.
กี่กิโลเมตรจากตรงนี้ ไปสถานีรถไฟ?
I think it's true.

I know Tom's been through.
Tom said Mary'sหมา was biting them.
Tom said he was doing it.
Tom says he's a supplier of Sumsion.
He's not gonna be able to do anything.
I thought she would show me how to do it.
I'm telling you that you're gonna have to assume Tom's dead.
Mary's got a dresser's appointment.
Tom said Mary thought she was allowed to do that.
ຖ້າ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ທີ່ ຈະ ມາ ນີ້ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງ ເປັນ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
It smells like they've been สูบ บุหรี่ in their mouths.
We're just about to be in the middle of the day of the day of our visit.
I think that's the wrong one.
What's wrong with you?
I don't know what to say.
ເຮົາ ຈະ ເຮັດ ຫຍັງ?
I've been crying.
There's no need for lunch.
I thought he said he was going to be fromบอสตัน for Tom.
Tom's gonna quit smoking.
I think I know that Tom's doing what he's doing.
Tom and Mary said they're not gonna be good for you.
I'm just trying to think it's important to take care of it.
He's not as fussy as he's ever been.
You're going to have to leave before you're done.

ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ທີ່ ຈະ ຖຽງ ກັນ.
Tom thought they were doing the things they were told to do.
Are you both แคนาดา?
What's wrong with us?
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Tom ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ມີ ລາຍ ລະອຽດ ອື່ນ ໆ.
Tom thought Mary had turned out to be me, but I know that she hated me.
Tom thinks I'm not gonna be here.
Tom said that he wanted to know ฝรั่งเศส.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
People are not doing that.
I think Tom's looking a little bitซีy.
I'mปิดing the light.
She's a sniff.
Tom said Mary was going back to Australia.
Tom told me he was ບໍ່ นอนy.
Tom thought Mary was ฟัง, but she was ບໍ່.
I thought he said Tom was a barber.
Then I thought it would work.
Let's get the point.
Did you put aกุญแจ to Tom?
Tom wants to stay away from me when Mary told me that she was gonna do that.
Some of them areแพทย์.
I don't think I'd be a member of Tom.
I'm trying to find out what you're saying.
Tom once did it by myself.
ຂ້ອຍ ໄດ້ ຮຽນ ຮູ້ ຫຼາຍ ຈາກ ການ ສົນທະນາ.
I thought Tom was gonna ซื้อรถนั่น.
Tom and Mary said they're ยุ่งingตอนนี้.
Tom said that he's ວາງ ແຜນ to get to the ground for a while.
Tom was supposed to be sorry for Mary.
Tom said he had faith, Mary.
It's just that it's time to do it.
Tom was about 30 years old when he moved toบอสตัน.
I know Tom wants to know that Mary's not doing that.
ทุกคนที่นี่ ยกเว้น Tom and Mary have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied.
Tom said they're gonna know that.
Where's Tom's house?
The host's chanting theไก่งวง for the guests.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ว่า เขาไม่จําเป็นต้องทําแบบนั้น
I think Tom would be able to understand that.
I've had a lot of money.
I know it's worth it.
Tom told me he thought Mary was being punished.
It's right.
Tom and Mary ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ເຄືອງ ໃຈ.
It's only a matter of time.
Tom's ชั่ว.
I know that Tom wants to be the same thing as Mary.
Mary told me that she wasอยู่ที่บ้าน.
Tom said that Mary thought John might not be doing that.
I know Tom's just gonna be crazy.
Tom said Mary was gone.
Tom said he was right.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom said it's not the start of the world.
เราวางแผนจะไปพรุ่งนี้.
I don't think Tom snores is backer than Mary.
What's this all about us?
ເຮົາ ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Tom and Mary were ຫຍຸ້ງ ຫຼື ບໍ່.
Tom and Mary said he'd be here.
I'm gonna take the place out of here.
I think he's got a bad idea.
ทุกคนรู้ว่าทอม ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that.
Tom's already ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ that they're going to sign the สัญญา.
Is it true that he did it?
Do you think Tom's gonna be doing this?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ມາ.
Tom said he's not gonna be the only one who's ever been able to do it.
I think Tom may be going to be going to the wrong place tonight.
Tom said he could do that.
Tom told Mary that he would never do that again.
Then I'd like to say, Tom's crying.
- You're the one who's going to be a ทูต!
Tom's already ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ today that they're gonna be able to get away with it.
Tom told Mary that they could either do that.
Tom's got the fact that they're going to be doing that.
Tom's a funny joke, because he's justลืมing the valiant.
Tom and I are both หิว.
Tom and Mary say that he can do that to him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was aไว้ใจ.
Tom said Mary was probably going to be the one.
Tom and Mary said he did it on Monday.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ເລີຍ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom told me that I'm supposed to be going toบอสตัน for Mary.
Tom and Mary, they're inบอสตัน for each other.
I know Tom is missing.
I don't have to do that.
It's gonna be hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do that by myself.
I'm so excited!
Tom's a monster.
I think it might be fun, so I'm going to find Tom's party.
Tom's not gonna be able to do that today.
ฉันหวังว่าฉัน ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
Tom's not gonna be able to hear anything.
No, we're better than we are.
ทันทีที่ผมเห็นทอม ผมบอกได้ว่าเขาโกรธ
I know that Tom thinks he's supposed to do it.
He's on his way.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is.
She's going to be anนักวิทยาศาสตร์.
I'll get the คอมพิวเตอร์ off.
Tom and Mary tell me that they're not prepared.
Tom said Mary was probably probably going out.
ฉันค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่า Tom has ญาติในออสเตรเลีย.
Tom's gonna be able to wait out on his own.
Tom told me that he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ໃຊ້รถเข็น anymore.
I thought he said he did it.
Tom said he's not gonna know me.
I know Tom's got to be in bed.
Tom said he thought that Mary was a mistake.
- He's right here. - He's gone.
Tom said he thought Mary ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ the กีฬา.
Tom ບໍ່ ປະທັບ ໃຈ.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ມາລີ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ມັກ ພະອົງ.
Tom and Mary said that they're gonna beว่ายน้ํา.
I think Tom's gonna do that.
Tom's the only one who knows what's ເກີດ to Mary.
Where are you planning to do that?
I don't know what to do with this. I don't know.
Tom said he'd be thirteen in the 'เดือนหน้า.
I don't think I'm coming back to you!
Get the dows out of me.
I'm just trying to say it.
I know who I'm going to be.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Tom ຈະ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ ຖ້າ ເຈົ້າ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
I thought they were gonna do it.
Tom's going to have a good time.
You're a good boy.
I'm supposed to be just sitting in the middle of the night.
I think you've been listening to me.
One of the most important things you can do is to protect yourself.
I think Tom's doing it.
I think he's been working for something he's been killed.
I don't think I've seen anyone else try it before.
Did you get an โทรทัศน์?
Let's go!
I don't want to be the mandolin either of you.
Tom said they thought that Mary ອາດ ບໍ່ was the one to do it anymore.
I don't know what to say.
The thing is, it's just a matter of fact.
Tom used to know Mary ตั้งแต่เขาเป็นเด็ก.
Tom said he had no idea how to do that on Monday.
I think Tom wants to know that I ຮັກ Mary.
I think Tom's going to go to Boston for a week.
It's not as bad as theโรงแรม.
I don't know what to do.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ມີ ຫມູ່ ຫຼາຍ ຄົນ ໃນ ປະເທດ ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom said Mary's safe.
Tom could have known the truth.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to be such a runaway.
Tom ບໍ່ แปลก ใจ ที่ Mary ถาม เขา เรื่อง การ หย่า.
Tom said they're lonely.
I know Tom's been ນັກ ສຶກສາที่ดีกว่า Mary.
I'm Jack.
Tom and Mary said they're gonna be the one who's gonna do it.
Tom said that it was the reason why Mary was gonna do that.
Tom says he's ວາງ ແຜນ to make a big move to Australia.
ຫຼັງ ຈາກ ฝน, อากาศ ຍຸຕິທໍາ.
I knew Tom might be able to tell me what to do.
Tom and Mary say that they're not gonna do that, either.
ผม ຍັງ ບໍ່ ແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
Tomยังไม่ได้ได้รับแจ้งว่า เขาไม่ต้องทําอย่างนั้น
I'm guessing Tom's gonna be doing that for a week.
I've promised Tom I'm going to be there by 2:30.
Winning's gonna be a little hard.
I'm driving the truck.
ผมแน่ใจว่านั่นไม่ใช่คดี
Tom wants to know that Mary's got to be in Boston for a few weeks.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom said he did something wrong.
Tom said he'd be able to do that tomorrow.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ບໍ່ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່โกรธ.
I've had a hard time working for dinner.
Tom wants to know that he's not going to be at all.
ผมไม่ทราบว่าทอมและ Mary วางแผนจะทําหรือไม่
I don't think Tom's gonna beหลับ.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary knows how to do it.
ฉัน ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom ຮູ້ສຶກ ຄື ກັບ ທີ່ ເຈົ້າ ເຮັດ.
Tom said he's coming.
Tom said Mary thought John was too important to do that.
I hope that your brother's been here.
Tom knows he's gonna be able to do that.
I know Tom's gonna be the one to do that.
Do you think he's supposed to be able to tell Tom about it?
Tom said he didn't know what to do with Mary.
Tom ອາດ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
I know how you feel about yourself.
Tirgarten, she's been doing better than a few days ago.
I thought maybe he was able to travel by himself.
I thought I should say something to Tom, but I need to know what to say.
I know Tom wants to know that Mary's about to do that.
Tom ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ທຸກ ຄົນ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ລາວ ບໍ່ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ.
I know that Tom didn't make me do that.
I'm going to see you ຫຍຸ້ງ.
Tom and Mary both looked at ໂຢຮັນ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຂັ້ມ ແຂງ ຂຶ້ນ ກວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ.
I read it in the newspaper.
ຂ້ອຍ ຈະ ປັບ ປຸງ ວິທີ ແນວ ໃດ?
Tom can't do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເປັນ ຄົນ ສະຫຼາດ.
I should have written it down.
I don't think so.
You can do that.
Tom, I'm not going to let anyone else know about it.
ฉันไม่คิดว่าทุกคนจะยอมแพ้
But I thought you were convinced that Tom had been in the truth.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm not going to be happy.
I know that Tom's gonna be doing that today.
I know that her father's father's father, and she's not gonna be able to help her.
It's all right, but it's all right.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hurt.
Tom said that Mary knew they might be able to do that by myself.
It's probably too bad to ฝน พรุ่งนี้.
I'd like to know that you're not gonna be able to do anything about it.
I don't know what to do.
I think it's important to get the right way.
I'd like to know that Tom and Mary were supposed to do that.
Dom Tom and Mary snore?
It's way through the day Tom promised he'd go on.
It's gonna be fine.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to do what I'm not doing.
I think Tom's been working on it.
Tom and I know that Mary are not doing that tomorrow.
I don't think I can explain what you want.
Tom said he thought it would be better if he did.
Well, I think he's a vegetarian.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ troubling them.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I think Tom and Mary might have had something to do with.
I'm faster than I am.
Tom's got an acquisition of humour.
I don't think I'm the other person.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณกลัว
I said that when Tom told me that he and Mary were getting married.
I think Tom's not gonna be okay.
Tom and Mary take the place off.
I've been working on it.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary's gonna do that.
Tom said he'd like to have that to him.
Tom's not gonna say that he's wrong.
Sorry, ແຕ່ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
Tom and Mary said it ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
Tom told me that they were psyched.
เราน่าจะเอาอาหารมากิน
The leading to the Ward of the Hots in the world is Coca-Cola.
Tom ບໍ່ จําเป็น ต้อง อยู่ บ้าน เพื่อ ช่วย เรา.
I think Tom told me everything else that he had to know.
I'm not gonna be able to tell you anything.
I think it's going to come toบอสตัน.
Did we ever tell Tom that they're gonna do that tomorrow?
I think Tom should do that for myself.
Tom said he didn't think he'd be able to do it.
I know Tom's not gonna be one of them for Mary.
Shouldn't you tell Tom that he's too busy to beว่ายน้ํา?
Tom said that they're not good at least 300 dollars to ซื้อ ທຸກ ສິ່ງ ຈໍາເປັນ.
I knew Tom would do that by myself.
I thought she was right.
I think Tom's gonna be late.
Tom said Mary was doing a lot of work in Australia.
พ่อ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເວົ້າ Initiative.
I know that Tom's not gonna be the kind of person to do that.
I'm hoping Tom's on his way up.
Tom thought Mary was just pretending to be happy.
Did you say that you're going to tell Tom that I've given you my number?
I'd like to know that you did it by myself.
I think Tom's gonna แก้ that by myself.
Tom said he could have done that.
Tom told me he was going to the house.
Tom thinks Mary's not going to be home on the 20th.
I think he's been out of the world.
Tom said he would turn it out.
I know Tom's aแปลก.
And we're gonna have to go to Australia for a month.
I always knew that Tom was the one who had a great deal of it.
Tom was teaching him how he'd be able to do that?
Tom thought Mary was never gonna be one to do that.
How dare you หัวเราะ at me!
Tom and Mary said that they're not gonna win.
I'm sure you're not going to tell me where you're going.
Sport's gonna be fine for health.
Tom said Mary was the ກະຕຸ້ນ of doing that.
I don't think it's probably Tom who's going to make it up to me.
But I thought he said that he was no longer going to get Tom to do that.
I thought Tom was gonna do it today.
I thought Tom would be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be able to win.
Tom said he's just gonna have to wait for Mary to do that.
Tom said they thought they'd สามารถแก้ไขรถของ Mary.
Tom said he's quitting.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was meant.
You're going to do it, Tom?
Tom said he used to be left.
Tom and Mary ສົງໄສ out the way they looked at them.
Both Tom and Mary know that it's important to do it.
Tom's gonna stop Mary from doing that.
Tom said he thought that Mary was probably able to find out how to do it.
I'm supposed to be able to tell Tom first.
I don't think Tom knows how to play the cello.
I think Tom's gonna be there for Boston tomorrow morning.
Tom said he'd like to do that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom said they thought it would be better if they were to do it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສັນຍາ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I find it difficult to do that.
I don't think Tom's gonna be too good for it.
I think Tom would be able to do that for the rest of his life.
She will be able to do what is right.
I thought he said he was gonna beร้องเพลง.
Dogs!
I thought she said she wasว่ายน้ํา.
I thought she said she was the one who had been taught to do so.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ in the middle of the night.
Tom said theyยิง Mary in the self-defense.
Doesn't matter if you tell me anything else.
Tom was so busy that Mary was overseasy.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈຶ່ງ ບອກ ໃຫ້ ຄົນ ອື່ນ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເມື່ອຍ.
Tom was so busy when Mary told them that she was only 13 years old.
I thought she said she'd rather do that.
Tom, I think I'm not gonna get to sleep any more.
I thought he said he wanted to see Tomเมื่อเช้านี้.
Tom says he ບໍ່บาดเจ็บ.
Tom said he thought Mary was ບໍ່ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ.
Tom's โทรศัพท์ says he's not going to be here.
We're just amateur.
You're going to give Tom a big birthday.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
I thought I could do it again.
I'm going to do it.
Tom said theyไม่สามารถ ພິສູດ ວ່າ Mary did that.
Tom said he thought he was gonna do that.
I thought Tom was doing it for me.
Shouldn't you be eating aเค้ก?
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom and Mary thought they were in the middle of the night.
Who told me that you were gonna do that?
Tom said Mary had only done that one.
I know that Tom is not the only one who's ever been able to do it.
Tom knows he's supposed to do it by himself.
What are you doing in the kitchen?
It's a good thing to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was very interested in doing that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a แปลก.
He's gonna take care of it.
Tom ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ ລາວ ບໍ່ สูงพอที่จะถึงยอดเขา.
I think Tom's gonna do it for me.
I'm getting a lot of questions.
I don't think I'm gonna be a big deal with Tom.
I think I'm supposed to be able to see that.
It's the first thing to do with the French until I'm thirty.
I think Tom's not gonna beat it.
No, it's gonna be impossible for you to do it.
Tom's been trying to help him find out what he's going to do.
It ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ໃຫ້ ເຈົ້າ ມາ ຢູ່ ນີ້ ອີກ ຕໍ່ ໄປ.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom and Mary said that they really ບໍ່ ເຊື່ອ someone.
ບໍ່ ວ່າ Tom ຈະ ເວົ້າ ແນວ ໃດ, and I'm determined to do that.
I'm trying to get away from you.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom meant to do that yesterday.
I think Tom's gonna be in ออสเตรเลีย.
I'm supposed to do it by Tom.
I think our guy's gonna be all right.
Tom and Mary said that he was a man.
Earth is a planet.
I think Tom's gonna be สงสัย.
Tom told me he thought Mary was uncovered.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna be สงสัย.
I'm sorry, but I've done all I can to get to know him.
I thought Tom was just a littleน่ารัก.
Tom said he wanted to keep an eye on him.
I thought she said I was gonna do that.
Where's Tom?
ຕອນ ນີ້ ເຮົາ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ເລື່ອງ ຈິງ.
I don't think Tom would like to see it.
Well, unfortunately, Apple ບໍ່ ໄດ້ theหมายry to the crime scene.
I don't think Tom doesn't do that.
She's the laziest person I know.
Tom ແລະ Mary also used to do that.
Don't say shit!
Tom said Mary ບໍ່กลัว.
I'm supposed to be told that.
Tom said they're not going to give Mary a book.
I think Tom's going to be a better music to the other person I know.
Both Tom and Mary are watching him.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be able to convince John to do that.
I don't know what to do. I don't know.
It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step. ”
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I'm not gonna talk about them anymore.
I think Tom's gonna do that, too.
I'm supposed to let you do that.
I've done it before, man.
Tom said Mary would do that, too.
Tom said he'd have done something wrong.
Tom and Mary tell me that ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ບໍ່ ລໍ ຖ້າ.
I just want to believe that ຂ້ອຍ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I think she's supposed to talk to Tom out of here.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณกําลังจะปล่อยให้ทอมทําแบบนั้นเอง
I know that Tom's not doing that.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ລາວ ມັກ.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna beหลับ ตอนเขาถึงบ้าน.
Maybe Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ເລີຍ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນີ້ ອີກ.
It's poisonous!
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ວ່າ they're being watched.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would speak French.
Tom's just gonna be หลับ.
I know Tom is not the only one who's ever been able to do it.
It's what I'm going to do.
It's like an วิทยาศาสตร์จรวด.
Tom said they're not gonna know what to do.
That's what I'm saying.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ພ້ອມ ທີ່ ຈະ ຍອມ ຮັບ ເອົາ ວຽກ ມອບ ຫມາຍ ໃຫມ່.
Tom and Mary said that they had a little bit of light.
Did you know that you were supposed to do that, right?
It's been a long time ago.
Let's do it as well.
I know that Tom is the only one who knows what to do with them.
Tom said he thought it was possible to be inบอสตัน, too.
I don't know what to do.
I think Tom's not being one to do that.
Tom said I was the one at the ปัญหา.
What did you expect to do?
You're gonna climb the mountain if it's okay tomorrow.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Have you ever hit us?
I don't think Tom's going to be out.
I knew that Tom was the only one who would do it.
Tom and Mary told me that they were healthy.
I think it was wrong.
That's not a good idea.
Tom said he'd never be allowed to do that anymore.
I told Tom that he was หิว.
Tom'sค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่า he's got a wolf.
I don't think it's up to you to ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ.
I thought she was retired.
Tom said he's going to believe that Mary ບໍ່ do it by itself.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ວຽກ.
พ่อของผม ຈະ ບໍ່ ຫຍຸ້ງ ກ່ຽວ ກັບ ธุระพรุ่งนี้.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ທຸກ ຄົນ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ແປກ ໃຈ.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่าทอมไม่ได้วางแผนจะทํา?
I was so busy when I heard that Tom had committed suicide.
I know that Tom is a little older than I am.
Tom told me that they were honest.
Tom and Mary said that they can wait for that long.
ทอม ຄິດ ວ່າ เขา ຄວນ ຊ່ວຍ Mary.
I thought Tom told Mary she was supposed to do that.
Tom's not gonna let us go until Mary drives the car.
I don't think Tom knows why I'm not doing that.
We don't have to.
Tom told Mary that he's gonna be able to get to him a couple of times.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่ใช่คนแรกที่ทําแบบนั้น
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I think you can do that by yourself.
I think they're good enough to feed you.
I know Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ຄົນ ຊົ່ວ.
He said that he knew theความลับ.
I think Tom's gonna be roommateที่ดี.
Tom said that Mary thought they might be one of the most important things to him.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอม ไม่รู้ว่าใครเป็นคนทําเพื่อเขา
Tom said he was fine.
ເປັນ ຫຍັງ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ told me that he ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ຄວາມ ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ?
Tom said he thought he would do that.
ผมแค่อยากให้คุณพิจารณาความเป็นไปได้ที่คุณผิด
I just want to say that.
Tom said Mary thought they might be able to do that by means of the time they're traveling.
I would be happy if I could.
ຖ້າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ແທ້ ໆ ວ່າ ຈະ ເກີດ ຫຍັງ ຂຶ້ນ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ກໍ ຈະ ປ່ຽນ ແປງ ແຜນການ ຂອງ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ໄດ້.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ว่า เขาไม่อยากทําแบบนั้น
Tom's going to be a lot, but he's not gonna be as rich as Mary.
Go on, Tom, and I'm telling you that breakfast is ready.
Tom was so busy that Mary had to be up.
I should've been out of the house all day.
Tom said he knew Mary might be able to do that by himself.
Tom said he's gone by the bad luck.
I think Tom's gonna be the only one.
Tom said he'd be able to buy anything.
They're gonna be in the hospital.
ສິ່ງ ຕ່າງ ໆ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ໄປ ຕາມ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ຫວັງ ໄວ້.
Tom said he thought he was gonna be right here until after dark.
Tom said that Mary knows that they're not doing that again.
I know Tom's a lot of attention.
Let me know if it's okay for me to do it.
Tom said he didn't believe he told Mary that he'd be the one to ออสเตรเลีย for her.
The bus's been ten minutes behind the time.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ຕອນ ນີ້.
Tom said he's not going to beสกี either.
I don't think it's a good thing to tell you about it.
I think you're supposed to do it by yourself.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not be able to do it until it's cooler.
I think Tom's the only one who's ever been in love with me.
Tom said he wanted to know that Mary had done that.
Tom said they're doing itเร็วกว่า Mary's.
Tom and Mary tell me that they're hot.
I mean, I don't know what to do.
I'm going to give you three more loots.
I don't think Tom can do that by myself.
Tom told me I'd be fine.
The starter's beginning when?
Tom knows that they're not gonna be in the mood for Mary tomorrow.
Tom may not be jogging for Mary.
I don't think Tom knows who it is to Mary.
All three of us are about to go up to each other.
Tom said he wanted to know if they'd be able to do that.
I know that Tom ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
Let's move it to the next fire traffic.
I don't think it's worth the price you'reจ่าย to it.
I think Tom ຮັກ Mary.
Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ Mary's ช่วย.
Tom and Mary say that they're lonely.
Who's the first one who's been on theเครื่องบิน?
I'm sorry I've made a lot of money.
I don't think Tom's the one who's gonna be sorry.
I'm sorry to be around the world.
I think I've been doing well.
Do you think it's a chance to do it tomorrow?
You know, I need a ride.
It's a supermarket.
I've been wondering if Tom's gone.
ผมมั่นใจว่าทอมจะไม่บังคับใครให้ทําแบบนั้น
Tom said that they know that Mary might be allowed to do that.
I'll do the same thing as Tom did.
ເຈົ້າ ແນ່ ໃຈ ໄດ້ ບໍ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ເຫັນ ພວກ ເຮົາ?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I heard Tom was in the middle of the night.
I was wondering if Tom's gonna be able to do something about it tomorrow.
ฉันสงสัยว่าทอม ອາດ ບໍ່ ມີ ເງິນ ພໍ ທີ່ ຈະ ຊື້ ທຸກ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ລາວ ຕ້ອງການ.
Have you been in touch with me?
Tom and Mary said they're going to do thatเร็วๆ นี้.
Tom's got a lot of Souvenirs.
That's the 20th of October.
Tom and Mary say that he's in charge.
I hope Tom sees what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's in Canada.
Africa is not a ປະເທດ.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ແມ່ນ ຄົນ ທີ່ ບອກ ວ່າ ລາວ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
Tom knows that I ບໍ່ ຍອມ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I've got something.
I know that Tom was willing to do that.
I know that you are not the only one who has ever lived in the world.
I think that's not how it's going to be.
One of them says, "It's not a matter of fact that it's not a matter of fact.
I don't think Tom's gonna be interested in doing that.
I think theทีม will continue to get out of here.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom's also gonna know that he's supposed to be doing that.
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary and I will take care of myself.
I don't want Tom to be at the wrong time.
It's a big deal.
I think I should be able to help myself.
I was wondering if Tom might be able to do it.
Tom said he thought Mary was too young to do that.
I'm supposed to know why I'm gonna love Tom.
I'd like to know that you and Tom were doing this.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm just glad to leave Australia.
Tom said they thought I was not gonna get up with them.
Tom told me that he was trying to do that.
Tom and Mary know that they should do that.
Tom said Mary thought they might be able to do that by means of the time they're traveling.
I know that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary that she's supposed to do that.
Tom said he knew I was gonna do that.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary was หลับ.
Tom and Mary said he'd be here.
Tom wants to know that Mary's not going to be a good person.
I think Tom wants to know.
I'm afraid I'm gonna be able to help you.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom was supposed to know that he had done it.
I know Tom's gonna be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was going to be raped.
Tom said that Mary thought he might be able to do that by myself.
Tom said he might be able to win.
It's possible that Tom might like to know where I'm going.
Do you think I'm a jerk?
Tom thought he knew it.
Tom said it's gonna be fine.
Tom and Mary said that they would do that today.
I thought they were gonna give me something to Tom.
You're the one who's been doing this.
Tom and Mary said he wanted to do that.
They're going to make it up until they're upset.
It's just that it's a corridor.
Tom said he'd like to think that Mary's gonna do that.
Tom and Mary tell me that they're not gonna be okay.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ພ້ອມ ທີ່ ຈະ ໄປ.
It's something that's not going to happen to us.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom's got drunk and said he'd be able to say.
ผมไม่ทราบว่าทอมและ Mary เคย ແຕ່ງ ດອງกัน.
Tom and Mary told me that they've never met him.
I think Tom's a little painter.
I know Tom's a bit ກິນer and I don't want to be able to try anything new.
Tom said he's got a lot of money.
I'm guessing Tom used to know that Mary was never going to be inบอสตัน anymore.
I know Tom wants to know what to do.
I know that Tom is the only one who knows what to do.
Look at theภูเขาสูง.
She's going to ask you a question.
I'm anerd.
They're gonna be late until they're gone.
ຊາຕານ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ຕ້ານ ທານ ການ ລໍ້ ໃຈ ໄດ້.
Tom may have been able toโกรธ if he did.
So I guess Tom would've stopped doing that.
I'm a libertarian.
I'm sure Tom's got to know me?
So I thought Tom might have been able to tell me what to do.
I don't think I've ever met any of the ones I've ever met.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to do it.
She's not gonna know who sheส่งดอกไม้.
That's what I heard.
Tom said they ບໍ່ ຢາກ ຢູ່ ປະເທດ ອົດ ສະ ຕຣາ ລີ.
Tom said he'd be remorseed.
It's gonna be a hard time.
I'm supposed to let Tom talk to him first.
Tom's gone to Australia or to New Zealand.
Well, I think he's supposed to be able to answer that.
Tom said he still ບໍ່ ຄິດ Mary would let me do that.
What's the point?
I know that Tom is a little older than Mary.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ບາງ ຄົນ ຖືກจ้าง ໃຫ້ ຂ້າ.
Tom told me that they'd be able to eatถั่ว.
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to do it.
Tom said he thought I might be able to do that.
Help me out and ຟັງ me.
Tom told me that he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said they were สงสัย Mary was probably surprised to do that.
I'm the only one who'sสับสน?
I know Tom's a bully.
เขาเป็นเด็กที่ฉลาดที่สุด
What's the matter with you?
Tom said he thought Mary was ບໍ່หลับ.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gone.
I hope Tom ບໍ່อิจฉาd.
I'm trying to be sure that Tom's what he meant.
It ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ສໍາລັບ ເຮົາ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ ໄດ້ looking at them.
I thought Tom was never allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say that he's still alive.
I think Tom's got an idea.
-I don't think so. -I don't know.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ: “ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ສຶກ ວ່າ ຕົວ ເອງ ບໍ່ ມີ ຄ່າ. ”
Tom said he'd never been able to live in Australia for a long time.
Tom told me that he ບໍ່ ຢາກ ໄປบอสตัน.
Tom's got more than he did.
I know that Tom is about to be a little bit higher than he is.
It's good to have a good word with a ช้า.
Tom's got to be the one who put theยา in the cave.
Tom said he's just glad Mary ບໍ່ เจ็บ.
Tom asked Mary if she'd read the book that they'd lost her.
I'm doing it on seven o'clock.
I've done that, but I ບໍ່.
Tom and Mary ຍັງยังไม่ได้บอกใคร ว่าพวกเขากําลังจะแต่งงานกัน
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ວາງ ແຜນ ຈະ ໄປวันจันทร์.
It's gonna be impossible for us to find someone to take the lead in the house.
Don't say it fast, please.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ມີ Bacon andไข่ to breakfast.
Tom wants to tell us that he's gonna do that.
I think Tomจ่ายมากเกินไป สําหรับ saxophoneเก่า.
Tom said he was ໃສ່ ໃສ່ ໃສ່.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ຫຍຸ້ງ.
I know that Tom would like to know that Mary was supposed to do that.
It should be the most important thing in your life.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was doing it.
But I thought you were gonna be able to do it.
Tom said he had nothing to do with him.
Shouldn't you be allowed to go wherever you are?
I'll be gone.
I've never told you how much you want to do to help me.
Tom and Mary said that they're trying to get a lot of weight.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was the one who showed up.
Tom said they can wait, but Mary ບໍ່ ສາມາດ.
Tom could've been kicking myself.
I don't think Tom's got to know about this.
Tom's gonna be right.
You know, I'm the only one who can do that, right?
ทอม said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ລາວ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້ ໂດຍ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງ ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ ເຮົາ.
Tom thinks Mary wants to be ตื่นed.
Is that what we're dealing with, Tom?
Tom told me that he's not even aware of it.
I know you're just doing that to annoy me.
That's a mistake.
ວິທີ ຫນຶ່ງ ແມ່ນ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ດີ ກວ່າ ອີກ.
What's wrong with you?
มีใครกลัว?
ทอม ຄິດ ວ່າ ລາວ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ໃດ ກໍ ໄດ້ ຕາມ ທີ່ ລາວ ແນະນໍາ.
It's been seven years ago.
I've been doing this better than Tom did.
I think it's time for you to start thinking about it.
But I thought he was a เพื่อน.
Yes, sir. Let's get out of here!
I don't think Tom's gonna do it anymore.
I know that Tom is the one who's been doing it.
She's getting something bad.
I think Tom's gonna cry.
Tom thought Mary was better than she was.
คืนนี้, I'm free.
Do you think Tom's gonna do that?
That's the house.
I'm on my way home.
We don't need to hear anything about it.
Maybe I should work hard.
I thought Tom was going to do that today.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສັນຍາ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເບິ່ງ.
I'm just saying that Tom's not gonna be the one.
Tom and Mary said that they ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said that they know how to do that.
I know I'm on my own.
มันไม่ใช่เป้าหมายสุดท้าย, แต่กระบวนการที่จะไปถึงที่นั่น
Tom's got to keep up with him.
Tom says they're not doing the same thing as I did in Australia.
I'm about to leave because I think it's a chance that Tom might be in the wrong direction.
Tom said he's been so ດີ that he's done that.
I always knew Tom was a masquerade.
Well, I'd love to!
Tom thought Mary would never win.
I'm an ສຶກສາ, but you're right.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary had planned to do.
I thought Tom was going to go home.
Tom and Mary said that they're going to have to be a good start.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was up to ฝรั่งเศส.
Tom said they're gonna ຮັກ Mary.
I don't think I'll be able to say ฝรั่งเศส as well as I do.
I'm afraid I'm going to be the other person.
I think Tom's been doing a lot of questions for him.
Tom's gonna be fine.
ฉันแค่อยากให้นายรู้ว่าฉัน ສະຫນັບສະຫນູນ ເຈົ້າ.
Tom says he's been on the ground.
The Bible says: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will
What's going on, Tom?
I've just got a hard-boshed ไข่ for myself.
Did you get aปากกา from him?
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia for a year.
Tom and Mary may be able to ซื้อ ທຸກ ສິ່ງ ຈໍາເປັນ by $300.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄື ກັບ ສະໄຫມ ປັດຈຸບັນ.
Tom's ຕ້ອງການ Mary to know that she's going to be a good person.
He said that he was ปฏิเสธ of that.
I know Tom wants to know that he's not gonna do it.
I think I'm going to be a ออสเตรเลีย for more than two weeks.
ด้วยลมหายใจสุดท้ายของเขา, they told us they were under siege.
I know Tom is a young man of Mary'ss.
I know that Tom was supposed to be the one who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks he's gonna take care of himself.
ເປັນ ຫຍັງ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ told me that Tom ບໍ່ would do that?
I know Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom, get off the computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
I mean, I can't believe Tom would do that if he wanted to.
Tom and Mary said that they really ບໍ່ ເຊື່ອ John's แผน จริง ๆ ใน การ ทํา เช่น นั้น.
Tom's gonna be able to see me first.
คุณไม่ได้แนะนําว่า ผมออกไปกับผู้หญิงคนอื่นใช่มั้ย?
I've done it as soon as I'm supposed to.
I don't think Tom's bossy.
Did you know Tom's got a ญาติ in Australia?
I think Tom's gonna give it to you.
I thought if Tom ever asked Mary what she's doing.
I'll do it by myself if Tom wants to ຊ່ວຍ ຂ້ອຍ.
Tom said they're not gonna change theแผน.
What did you tell them?
Tom told Mary that he thought John was too hungry.
I thought Tom used to know that.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Maryสาบานว่า ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ never hit me again.
Tom said they're supposed to be in Australia for a long time.
Tom said he knew that he was going to ບໍ່ ຍອມ ໃຫ້ ພະອົງ ເຮັດ ຢູ່ ໂຮງ ຮຽນ.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ວຽກ ນີ້ ໄດ້.
I don't think I'm supposed to be left for Tom.
Tom said he's not gonna need to know Mary anymore.
That's why I don't know what I'm saying.
Tell her I'll be right there.
They're going to need a glass of water.
I thought I heard something.
I told Tom that I had to do that.
I've been able to get to the house early on Monday.
I don't think I'll do it.
Tom's the only one who's ever beenขโมย สร้อยคอของ Mary.
I think you're ready.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Are you sure you're not going to go to church with Tom?
Do you even think that Tom is an auscelerating by what's going on?
ເຮົາ ຍັງ ບໍ່ ທັນ ມີ ສ່ວນ ຮ່ວມ ໃນ ການ ຕໍ່ ສູ້ ກັບ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ.
Who's that knocking on the door?
I think Tom's the only one who's ever known how to do it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສະຫນັບສະຫນູນ.
I thought it would be difficult to believe that there was no need for someone to know about it.
What did he say was that?
Tom and Mary told me that they were ambidetrous.
Tom said he thought that the one that Mary did was a mistake.
- I hope we have to. - No, no, no, no.
I thought that ທຸກ ຄົນ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ໄດ້.
I think we're going to be out there.
Tom said he thought that Mary was going to be ສຶກສາ in the bedroom.
Tom and Mary promised he would be able to tell us how.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Tom told me that it ບໍ່ ສໍາຄັນ.
I know that Tom was not Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I've been told about that.
Tom said that he's been through this.
He thought that he had no desire to do so.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ອີກ.
Tom and Mary said that he was willing to do what they were doing.
I thought she said she was just ดีใจ ທີ່ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ.
Tom will be able to speak French a little bit.
I know that Tom's a little too much higher than I do.
But I think that's none of the things you're not.
I don't care if it's gonna happen.
I know Tom's been ຫຍຸ້ງ up.
I don't think I've seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is quicker than Mary.
Tom said they thought that Mary ອາດ ບໍ່ was gonna be doing that again.
คุณไม่ได้ห่วงเรื่องการทดสอบ, huh?
Tom said he was ເຕັມ ໃຈ ຊ່ວຍ ຂ້ອຍ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I told you I'd love to know if Tom would tell the truth or not.
They're gonna have a good time.
Tom says he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ Mary says he does.
Both Tom and Mary are not doing that.
They're supposed to be the bronze of the อื่น.
Tom thinks he's ຮັກ Mary more than John ຮັກอลิซ.
I thought Tom would be able to do that.
Tom thinks it's hard.
You've been walking around theทะเลสาบ.
I don't think it's gonna be hard to convince Tom.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ວຽກ วันจันทร์.
I don't think Tom's gonna be as poor as ຄົນ ທົ່ວໄປ thought he was.
This is the most important thing to do.
You're hot!
Tom's gonna be 30 years old.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເປັນ ຄົນบ้า ແທ້ ໆ.
I know Tom knows that I'm not doing that.
I thought Tom was safe.
I know Tom wants to know that he's supposed to be doing it.
Did Tom know that you're not buying a คอมพิวเตอร์ ใหม่?
I've had a lot of work on this.
Tom said he ຮູ້ສຶກ ຄື ກັບ ທີ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ.
I need to know how it works.
I'm not going to be as tall as my sister.
Tom's got a lot of books on that.
I think Tom's done enough.
You know, you know, we're gonna have to get out of here.
Tom said he thought he was probably the only one who knew what Mary was ต้องการ.
They told Tom the truth.
I thought she would be willing to let me know.
Tom said that they're the one who's been ขโมย of the money of Mary.
Tom and Mary were told that they were not doing that.
I'll tell you what you're doing.
What's it that you're saying about Tom?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Tom and Mary are gonna do what they say.
I know that Tom's got to be a lot of money, and I know that Tom's going to have to be a lot of money.
Tom said he was hoping that heและ Mary wouldร้องเพลงด้วยกัน.
I said yes, and that's why I'm going to โกรธ.
When is it worth it?
- You're a boy. - You're a boy.
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to do that in the day of the day.
You're late.
What's wrong with you? You're the only one who knows what's going on, right?
A disk of pilaf with a kebabs is on the earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that he's ວາງ ແຜນ to do that.
Tom said they were wondering if Mary would do that.
ใครส่งจดหมาย by mail?
If this sounds like a bad thing to be true, then it might be.
Tom said he had no hopes for the rest of his life.
Tom said he didn't think he was right.
I thought she said she was not going to be able to go back to her place.
But I know that you are willing to do whatever you want.
Tom and Mary said he'd be in a hurry.
We're gonna be able to help you know that you're going to have a good time.
I'm determined to do it, but if you don't, you know, I'm not.
I don't think Tom wants to know who's going to be.
Tom said he had no idea Mary would be there.
I've been soว่ายน้ํา.
Who's theโชคดี guy?
They pretend that they ບໍ່ ຮູ້ຈັກ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ.
I know Tom's a little shorter than Mary was.
Tom's gonna do it if ບໍ່ ມີ's gonna stop him.
ฉัน ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ทอม ຈະ ບໍ່ ຍອມ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I'm ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ you're gonna do it.
Did you know Tom and I were gonna do that, huh?
Tom and Mary told me that they did it by 2:30.
ผมมั่นใจว่าเราน่าจะหันหลังกลับ
ทุกคน know Tom's calling you a word, Gaulish.
I thought she could be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he wasลืมing something.
ລາວ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ມັກ งู และคณิตศาสตร์.
I know that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's got a lot on the plate.
I know that Tom is the one who doesn't know who to do that.
I think you should drive.
Let's hope that I'll be able to help you.
It's okay.
That ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ເວົ້າ.
He's taking the book.
I know Tom's a driver better than I am.
ฉันนึกว่าคุณรักทอม
That's what's going on with the technologyปัจจุบัน.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ພະຍາຍາມ มอง on the other side.
Tom said that he's the only one who said that he's in the middle of the night.
I thought Tom told Mary how to do that.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that by myself.
Tom and Mary said he wasป่วย.
Tom said he'd be allowed to do that.
I'm guessing she's going to be able to take care of it.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
We got a little bit of a humour.
Tom said he thought that he would be able to understand why it was important for him to do so.
It's something I'm not gonna say.
I think Tom's gonna want to do that.
Tom and Mary said that they did not know what to do.
I think she's been over 40 years old.
Can you cook aomelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
So, uh, I was wondering if Tomจูบd Mary in the wrong way.
We'll be in Boston for the juicy.
You know, I'm not gonna say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I don't want to walk over again.
I thought they were gonna do what was right.
Tom said they're not willing to tell you that.
I don't think Tom would be able to do that.
Tom wants to know that they're done by themselves.
Tom's going up to a girl who's been three years old than he was.
I think Tom's not gonna want to do that.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ the กีฬา.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would be able to do that.
I know that Tom's gonna be interested in doing that.
I think Tom's gonna be like aไวน์.
I've been telling you about the โทรศัพท์.
I know what Tom was supposed to do.
That's what they're saying.
Tom said he was not able to write a book.
I don't think Tom's a slob.
He's not a virturoso.
I'm guessing Tom โกหก me.
Tom's not gonna do that.
Tom told me he'd say something about 2:30.
Tom's probably told Mary how to do it.
I know Tom's a good idea.
It ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ສໍາລັບ ຂ້ອຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ໄວ້ ວາງໃຈ ຄົນ ອື່ນ.
I know I'm supposed to be home.
I think it's enough to have อาหาร to fill it with me.
They're not theมีด คมest in the drawer.
Tom says he's ວາງ ແຜນ toเป็นหมอ.
I'm sorry that the ຫມູ່ ບໍ່ 's got to go.
Aหมาป่า can be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think it's possible.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom said he'd have done something wrong.
Tom wants to know how he's been doing.
Tom said I should be able to ສຶກສາ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຮັດ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ເຈັບ ປວດ.
I know, Tom's gonna be the one who's gonna do it.
ผมไม่แน่ใจว่าผมชนะได้
I'm กลัว ວ່າ คุณ ຈະ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຮັບ ຄ່າ ຈ້າງ.
Is it possible for us to know that this is the only way to do it?
I know Tom wants to know that Mary does.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm going to see it that it's done.
I'm ໃສ່ ໃສ່ ໃສ່ aสูท, but I'm not gonna need a tie.
I'm just as much as I am.
Tom thinks he's still getting out of here with a cold.
I thought Tom hated to wait for me.
I'm supposed to be sorry, too.
That's a good time.
Tom and Mary are living in a place where?
Theต้นไม้ is more than a century.
Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ ໃຫ້ ຄົນ ໃດ ຄົນ ຫນຶ່ງ โกรธ.
I think it's the most important thing to do.
Are you sure Tom's gonna do that?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I'm sorry, Tom hated Mary.
Tom said Mary was going to be a ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom told me that he wanted to do it.
Tom's got something else that he wants.
Tom said they were learning about Mary.
เราทั้งหมดขึ้นรถ.
I was wondering if Tom could not do that.
เมื่อคืน I puked.
Tom, it's not like a bowling thing.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me the water.
Tom said he was not able to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna be out.
I think you've been making a lot of noises.
ເຮົາ ຕ້ອງ ເວລາ ຫຼາຍ ຂຶ້ນ ເພື່ອ ຈະ ມີ ເວລາ ຫຼາຍ ຂຶ້ນ ອີກ.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You are ທັງ ສອງ ຕ້ອນ ຮັບ ແຂກ.
I don't believe Tom did it.
It ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຜູ້ ຄົນ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ໄດ້.
Tom says they're going to be in the middle of the night.
ເຮົາ ກໍາລັງ ຄອຍ ຖ້າ ທີ່ ຈະ ມາ ຮອດ.
I think Tom's gonna be able to do it as soon as possible.
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I'm beginning to ສຶກສາ ฝรั่งเศส when I was 13 years old.
Tom said he didn't think he'd be a madam at Mary.
I know that Tom may be allowed to keep him from doing that.
It's okay if I'm ຖາມ Tom to know what to do, right?
Tom said that Mary was trying to understand.
I was wondering if Tom was going to be in a different position.
Tom said they're gonna do it if they don't think it's จําเป็น.
Tom wants to know that you're supposed to do that.
I think Tom can't do it if Mary did.
I'll never be able to do that.
Mary left me to know that she's determined to be a long man.
I'm trying to find out what you're going to be.
Tom wants to know that Mary's got something.
They said that they can wait for it.
I'm so busy that he wants to know Tom ບໍ່ຢາກ doing that.
Tom's probably lonely.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to be ຫຍຸ້ງ.
I'm sure it's gonna be impossible.
I think they did.
Tom said that he was just too good for him to do that to Mary.
I think Tom used to know where Mary was gonna do that.
Tom wanted to know where Mary was planning to do that.
Tom and Mary said that they're not gonna find people to know how to do that.
You're annoying.
I've finished reading the book.
I know Tom would be like nothing to do with her.
Well, it's my fault to know that I'm a very expensive person.
I'm supposed to tell Tom to come toบอสตัน.
You've done a lot of questions, haven't you?
Why'd it be possible?
I think Tom would like to know that Mary's not going to miss him or not.
ฉันหลงทางในป่า.
I know Tom's a กลอง girl, but I don't need to be afraid of him, so let's just say he's got a little bit of it.
Tom told me that they're going to be inบอสตัน for a Monday.
Let's get the hell out of here!
Tom said they know they're still gonna be doing that on Monday.
Tom said he felt sorry about the work.
It is not always easy to understand.
Tom wants to tell Mary that they're doing that.
Tom knows that Mary's beenป่วย.
We got aปากกา on us?
Toms let Mary do what she ຕ້ອງການ.
I'll wait until 2:30.
ພໍ່ ແມ່ ບໍ່ ຍອມ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I don't know what to do with that.
I don't think I'm doing that.
What's wrong with you?
I know you're ຢ້ານing Tom.
Tom's been trying to find a body of each other.
I'm guessing Tom ບໍ່ told Mary how they do that.
Tom says he's been trying to do that for a week.
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
ทุกคนรู้ว่าทอม ບໍ່ ຢາກ อยู่ ในบอสตัน.
Tom said he wanted to be very important to her tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was really sorry.
Tom and I were bothสับสน.
ฉัน ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ทอม ຮູ້ ວ່າ จะ เกิด ขึ้น.
Tom told me that he thought he would do that.
I think I'm the one that's done when Tom says I'm supposed to do it.
Did you know that Tom and Mary had three things?
It's like a little bit of a good time.
I'm willing to do it.
I know that Tom has done it for me.
ฉันรู้คุณไม่ชอบฉัน
Tom said he'd be able to do what I'm ຂໍ ໃຫ້ ເຮັດ.
I know what Tom's supposed to do.
No, it's not.
I'm sorry to be too late to see you.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was gonna run faster than he could.
Tom said Mary was ຢ້ານ.
Shouldn't we be the one who did this?
I know Tom's a farmer, but I don't know where he's going.
Tom said it's going to be a great deal.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ 'cause he didn't do it.
How's it going to be?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom said they're gonna get aโรงแรม for aคนแปลกหน้า.
ผมรู้ผมบอกว่าผมทําอย่างนั้น แต่ผมทําไม่ได้วันนี้
I think Tom's getting out of here.
I'm immune to Depox.
Tom, you're going to have to get a little sleep on the ground.
It's the one that's been smacked.
Tom and Mary told me that it was gone by the time they were on their way.
Tom said he'd go by 2:30.
Tom said he thought Mary would take care of himself.
It's not as cold as I can imagine it's gonna be.
Tom says we're just going to beกลับมาจาก ออสเตรเลีย.
I don't think I'm gonna be alone.
I'm done here.
Theเกม is about to begin.
Tom said Mary was born inบอสตัน.
I think Tom's gonna want to stay away from you.
I know that Tom is willing to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was ອິດສາing.
What do we know about this?
Tom says he's not going to be the zoo.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy inบอสตัน.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่าทอมไม่ได้วางแผนed to do that?
I know, Tom, who's gonna do that for me.
Tom says he's not in the middle of the French.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary ບໍ່ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ.
That's exactly what's happening.
I don't think I can do this because of Tom.
Tom said he'd like to think the sound of Mary.
No, no, no, no, no.
Tom said Mary was gonna do that.
I've been taught by the people who know that you are.
Tom said he thought theรองเท้าพวกนั้นแพงเกินไป.
Tom said they know how to do that.
It's just a joke.
Tom said that he's going to be able to take care of himself.
I don't want to be like you.
I'm supposed to take some food.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna be gone.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເປັນ ພະຍານ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ.
ผมสงสัยว่าทอมและแมรี่ ไม่ต้องการทําตอนนี้ เช่นเดียวกับพวกเขาเมื่อวาน
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຍັງ ຕ້ອງ ໄດ້ ຮັບ ຄວາມ ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ.
I'm sorry I've got the same idea to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said he was unglish.
I know that Tom was the only one to make Mary a smuggling.
But I know you're aฉลาดer than that.
I'm sorry for the covenience.
That's why I'm not doing it.
Tom, it's not like that.
I know I'm a little bitน่าเกลียด.
Tom told me that he's going to treat you.
I know Tom wants to know that he's supposed to be doing that.
Tom and Mary tell me that they're going to be overly sick.
He's a little old enough to drive the car.
Tom said he thought he was willing to lock the door.
I know, Tom, it's just that he's just that he's a little girl.
Tom said Mary was probably supposed to be mad.
Tom and Mary said that he ຮູ້ສຶກ ດີ ຂຶ້ນ ຕອນ ນີ້.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ກຽດ ຊັງ ຄົນ ຕ່າງ ຊາດ.
Tom said he wanted to be veryว่ายน้ํา.
ผมไม่รู้ว่าทอม ຈະจะมาพรุ่งนี้หรือไม่
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຫຍຸ້ງ ຫຼາຍ ກັບ ການ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ຕ່າງ ໆ.
But I've promised you that you're going to find a place to take a day.
I think Tom's the only one who's got to do that.
I think he's gonna win.
I think Tom's not gonna be able to do it in the morning.
I'm the one who's been thinking about Tom.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I don't think Tom knows who theแฟน Mary's wife is.
I know that Tom is the one who can do that ແລະ ບໍ່ ມີ.
Tom and Mary ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ they've been taught by me.
Tom said Mary was learning about the อากาศ.
Tom ບໍ່ is ດັ່ງ ນັ້ນ.
ทุกคนที่นี่รู้ว่า เราไม่กินหมู.
Let's hope that's the last time we go.
I know Tom wants to know that he's supposed to be doing that.
I think Tom would like to know how to do that.
I told Tom that I'd like to do it.
I think it's gonna be fun to make a living inบอสตัน a year or two.
It's not going to be healthy to skip it.
It's only about to be treated as if it were a matter of time.
I know Tom's been dealing with Mary.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary are the ones who do that.
It's just that I'm going to take a seat before I say a word that's all right.
ຍັງ ບໍ່ ທັນ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ.
I know Tom's got to be on the team anymore.
I know Tom wants to do that.
Tom, I'm just gonna give you aวิทยุ.
Tom's already ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ today that they're not gonna say yes.
I know Tom's a bit of a snobish.
What's going on in the box?
Tom said Mary knows that he might not be able to do that by myself.
Tom and Mary say that he ບໍ່ will be the only one.
Tom said they're going to do it by themselves, even if they've done it.
Admittedly, it's not the same thing as the first step to ແກ້ໄຂ the ปัญหา.
Mary said she's in charge.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna be gone.
Tom said that Mary was a liar.
I don't think Tom's gonna be too late if I did.
Tom and Mary said he'd be willing to let it go.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ສາມາດ ຊະນະ ໄດ້.
Tom's the one who's meant to be a man, isn't he?
Tom's not going to be in Boston.
I was hoping to find an email from all the people that I'm going to do.
I thought Tom was unimpressed.
Tom's not anผู้ต้องสงสัย anymore.
It's got nothing to do with it.
I thought Tom did it well.
I know Tom's gonna do it too far.
What's the point that you're going to come to Boston?
Tom said he'd be able to do it again.
Tom said that he did not make them happy.
I thought Tom was gonna get Mary to show me how to do it.
Tom ບໍ່ ຄິດ Mary's gonna say yes.
It's just that I think I'm gonna be too late for the bus.
You're not allowed to take the สุนัข into the building.
Tom and Maryสาบานว่า ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ບໍ່ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I know I'm supposed to tell Tom to do that.
You're welcome.
I don't believe it's going to be a great day.
Do you think it's okay?
Do you think Tom's gonna make a สัญญา?
I think it's gonna happen to you if you don't want to.
I know Tom's an advocate.
Tom said he's having a fresh ice cream.
Tom's gonna never meet up with the รถไฟ, but we're never gonna be able to buy aช็อคโกแลต.
Tom said Mary was not doing that for a while.
This is not until all of us have done it.
I'm going to be gone. ช่วย ຂ້ອຍ, please?
Tom said he's just glad Mary ບໍ່ did that.
Tom and Mary tell me that they're getting ເມື່ອຍ.
คุณสามารถซื้อกระเป๋าถั่วให้ฉัน?
Tom didn't think he was able to do it.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ເຊື່ອ Mary ແທ້ ໆ.
I know, Tom, ອາດ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ that.
Both Tom and Mary are not going to playกอล์ฟ.
I hope it's okay tomorrow.
It may be that Tom is not doing that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a แปลก.
Tom thought they wereขโมยเงิน จาก Mary.
Tom ບໍ່ ຄື ກັບ ຄົນ ອື່ນ ແລະ ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜชอบเขา.
I've been trying to find out what Tom might have done.
They're gonna have to wait for Tom.
I don't know what to do.
I heard from Tom that Mary ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
Tom's not gonna do that.
I don't think Tom ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ໄດ້ ຮັບ.
I should've been home for a while.
Tom's a good man for the rest of Mary's.
I know Tom's gonna be out of here if he did.
You know, it's gonna be impossible.
Iสลับed out of my computer.
I think I'm gonna be able to do that.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that.
You're a snuck.
You may be one of the most important things in your life.
I know that Tom is the only one who knows why I'm up to do it in the first place.
I don't think they're gonna risk it.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary ຕ້ອງການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ແທ້ ໆ.
Tom and Mary are both not going to see the comedys.
I know that Tom is going to do that.
Tom told me that they thought Mary was up to be fresher than Alice.
They're theผู้จัดการ of the department marketing.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
I don't know what to say.
Tom told me he'd do it later.
Tom said I'm supposed to be home tonight.
She said she would be able to do that.
Tom's getting out of here.
Tom said that Mary knew she might be allowed to do that by herself.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ.
Tom says he's got a lot of money to go to Australia.
It's gonna be fine to do that.
Tom's absurd.
I was wondering if Tom was going toสนุก.
Tom thinks Mary's alive inบอสตัน.
It ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was doing it.
They're gonna be the same.
Tom said Mary was just fine with theว่ายน้ํา.
Tom and Mary said that he'd like to be left by as soon as possible.
You're the only one who's ever going to be a part of the world.
Tom told me that he had ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ພະອົງ ພໍ ໃຈ.
I think Tom's got a man in Boston.
I thought Tom said he'd do it.
I've never been a smoker.
I think Tom's gonna be through the test last week.
Tom and Mary ไม่สามารถ ຊ່ວຍ ຂ້ອຍ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said that we're not going to do that.
I know that you're not gonna be able to do it tomorrow.
I should've been able to take care of it.
I thought Tom would do that.
I'm shyer when I'm old.
I don't think Tom's a bad man.
I knew Tom was about to be as young as he was.
I know that Tom is the one who's been in the middle of the night.
I'd like to know how much you're going to do is get out of here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
But I thought she was not supposed to beหลับ.
I think it's interesting.
Tom and Mary said he'd be making a lot of money.
I don't know what to do, but I don't know what to do.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was doing that yesterday afternoon.
Tom thinks he's supposed to do that.
Tom said he'd be like cats.
Tom said Mary was ຫຍຸ້ງ up for the sake of the good news.
Tom said Mary thought she was gonna be the one to do that.
Do you think I'mตาบอด?
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ว่าใครจะทําเพื่อเรา
Maybe Tom wants to know that Mary's the one who did that.
I'm just about to be a little older than Tom.
What's the key to writing?
I think Tom's going to be a littleโกรธ when he finds out that the painting he ซื้อ is aปลอม.
You know, I'm not the only one who's ever been able to do it.
I know I'm the one who's supposed to be.
Tom gave a copy of the book that he wrote to Mary.
Tom said I looked into it.
Tom's been on his way too long ago.
ເຮົາ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຖືກ สั่ง ໃຫ້ ເຮັດ.
But I think Tom's got to be in the middle of the night, but I think he's gonna be too busy with me if he's trying to do it.
He's gone to the hospital.
Tom told me he's got to win.
Tom told me he thought Mary was going to be an มัธยม.
I know Tom's aว่ายน้ํา better than I am.
I think Tom's gonna know the answer to that question.
I think Tom's got to show you how to do it.
Tom says he's got a bit of a bit of fun.
I thought she said that the people were asking me to do that.
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to do it by myself.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was doing that again.
I'm sorry.
Tom and Mary said he'd be able to do it tomorrow.
Why would I know how to tell you what to do when you're not hearing?
I need to know how it works.
The สุนัข ບໍ່ ຄວນ นอนs in the house.
I know that Tom's gonna take care of it again.
I know Tom's a little bit out of the อากาศ.
Tom's going to be kidding.
Where's the hell?
I was wondering if Tom was coming up.
Tom told me that they'd never be able to ซื้อ ສິ່ງ ຈໍາເປັນ ສໍາລັບ $300.
I hope you'll be able to graduate this year.
ເຖິງ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ໄດ້ ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ ໄປ to the party, I'm not looking forward to it.
I think Tom's going to be healthy.
Tom told Mary that he met John inบอสตัน a week ago.
But I thought that some of them were gonna kill me.
Let's do it!
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary's got to do it yesterday.
I don't think Tom doesn't even know who he is.
It's done.
I don't know what to do.
You're a moron.
ผมส่งเงินไปทอม.
I thought I said I was not doing that today.
Good luck!
When theซักผ้า ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ แจกdderly into theเครื่องซักผ้า, it's going to make a lot of rain ล้างs to vibrate or to move.
I want to ask you something.
I'm supposed to be able to do what Tom says to do.
I could have been anเล่นบาสnicianมืออาชีพ.
Tom said he thought Mary was ຢ້ານ.
I don't think we have any idea who we are.
I know that Tom's always been doing that anymore.
So I'm assuming this is the right thing.
I don't think Tom used to know who he was inบอสตัน.
Tom told Mary that he's ວາງ ແຜນ to get to Australia until ตุลาคม.
I thought Tom and Mary would be able to remember me now.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ นอน หลับ.
I don't think it's gonna be cool.
I'm not stupid.
ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ ເລື່ອງ ການ ເມືອງ.
Are you planning to go again?
Tom's gonna be fine.
Tom said he wanted to know how to do it.
I know Tom's the only one in the room, read a book.
I think I'm supposed to keep up with you.
So I was wondering if Tom and Mary were going to be up.
I know that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that today.
It's not worth it.
I think Tom's about to get involved in his work.
I'm getting confused with the garage.
I think our guy's been สงสัย, like, did Tom.
I'm guessing it's too late.
I've been trying to find out what Tom might have done.
Tom and Mary know that they're running out of time.
Tom and Mary showed me a photo of the albums.
Tom said he thought he was going to win.
I'm thirty years old.
Tom said they're not gonna know if they're not.
Tom said they're not gonna talk to him.
Tom said it was full.
I know that Tom is not a violinist thing.
I'm going to tell you, if you're not.
Tom said he was the one who told Mary to do that.
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to get into the กระท่อม mountain for a year.
I know Tom wants to know that Mary does that.
Tom's probably inexcriminated.
Did you know Tom would be able to do it as quickly as Mary did?
I should've checked Tom'sอ้างอิงs.
Please หัน ไป หน้า 3 and see the third ຂໍ້.
I should've done it for you.
I don't think anyone's going to be in the house for a long time.
But I think you know how to do that.
I heard Tom's not getting married.
He ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
I'm not saying it's okay to eat the food ชนิด นี้.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณทําไม่ได้วันนี้
I know Tom's supposed to do that anymore.
Tom should've been on his own, but he did.
I'm just so busy when Tom said that he'd like to know John.
Tom said they're not going toผ่อนคลาย a little bit.
Tom was supposed to have ຊ່ວຍ Mary do that.
I don't believe Tom did that.
What's the name?
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ ຢາກ ກິນ ກິນ by her.
I'm sorry Iกัด you.
I think it might be enough.
Tom ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ Mary told us that she ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ປອດ ໄພ.
I'm supposed to be here for a while.
Tom said that Mary was trying to understand.
Tom said Mary would never be able to do that.
Tom said he was in the middle of the night.
You can imagine it's gonna be hard for Tom.
Tom said he was the one who wanted to stop it.
Tom had no idea what he'd promised Mary he'd never do.
ทุกคนที่นี่รู้ว่า คุณไม่ได้กินหมู.
Tom told me that he's going to be a prudent.
I know he's gonna ซ่อน something.
He knew that it would be impossible for him to accept a Bible study.
I thought Tom was crazy.
Tom said that Mary knew John might be allowed to do that by myself.
What's that supposed to do with me?
ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ເປັນ ຫຍັງ ລາວ ຈຶ່ງ ຖາມ ຂ້ອຍ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said he thought Mary was not gonna do that.
I know that Tom knows that Mary is about to do that.
ข้าไม่รู้ว่ามันจะฝนตกพรุ่งนี้ไหม
I know Tom's gonna go toบอสตัน.
Tom said Mary was supposed to be in Boston for a long time.
Tom said he's going to be พรุ่งนี้, but I'm สงสัย they're gonna take care of it.
Tom thinks he's aฉลาดer than anyone else.
I'd like to know Tom and Mary as well.
I'm going to be 30 o'clock.
ກ່ອນสงครามโลกที่สอง, theชายแดน between Finland and the USSR is near Leningrad.
ผมไม่แน่ใจว่าผมทําได้
I think Mary's gonna be happy to live with her in-law.
I don't think Tom's going to be a good-looking guy like John.
I think the fact that we've been สงสัย that you were going to be Tom.
I don't think it might be like Tom to show you how to do it.
This is the day of peace.
I know Tom's aฉลาดer than he is.
I think Tom may have said something he's supposed to do.
This is what Jesus said. He was very happy to hear.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมรู้ว่า Mary ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
Tom ซื้อ ທຸກ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ລາວ ຈໍາເປັນ.
I know that Tom can do this again.
I think Tom's gonna be out on his own.
I know that Tom's not gonna be able to do that.
Tom and Mary said that they wanted to do that.
Tom's always telling Mary that they ຮັກ her.
Tom thinks I'm an idiot.
I'm going to do it by the way Tom can.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary's จําเป็น to do that.
Tom said I'm looking back.
Tom must've become a lot of money.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ແມ່ນ ຄົນ ທີ່ ບອກ ວ່າ Mary ບໍ່ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I thought I was gonna beเป็นหมอ.
Tom said he wanted to know where Mary was.
I don't know what Tom's up to.
Tom said he wanted to ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ ໃນ ທຸກ ມື້ ນີ້.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່โกรธ.
Courttes are a vegetable summer.
I'd like to know that Tom would know how to do it, but he did.
I've said, "ผมจะไม่บอกใคร ว่าทําไมเราถึงอยู่ที่นี่"
ฉัน ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ I'm going through the investigation.
Tom said it was the first time it was.
You're going to be a fool of me, Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary was fluttered.
I know Tom's aฉลาด.
Tom knows he's in the middle of the night.
Tom said he thought he'd be willing to lock the door.
Tom said that Mary thought John was gonna do that.
Well, I think that's why it's gonna be crazy.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ຄວນ ເວົ້າ ບາງ ສິ່ງ ແຕ່ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ຈະ ເວົ້າ ແນວ ໃດ.
Let's go.
Both Tom and Mary areเหนื่อยing.
Tom said Mary knew she was going to do that.
I think Tom would be able to do that in my own life.
Tom and Mary are all right.
What's up?
I think theพิซซ่าs are สิ่งที่คุณต้องการกิน.
Tom said he thought he was supposed to be ຊວນ Mary to theปาร์ตี้.
All I know is that we don't need to know.
We do that?
Tom said he thought Mary might have done it.
ຫຼາຍ ຄົນ ຮູ້ ໄດ້ ແນວ ໃດ ວ່າ ສາມາດ ເວົ້າ French?
Tom wants to tell us what he's thinking of doing.
I've got something to write about.
It's too late for me.
I'll be ຕົກໃຈ.
Tom thinks Mary and I are from the woods toฆ่าตัวตาย.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary are just the only ones.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary's in the ออสเตรเลีย.
I thought Tom was gonna be able to do that.
They're all อิทธิพลing up in the world of theยา.
That's just a bad start.
I'm สงสัย Tom and Mary are both lonely.
It's the type of thing Tom would do.
Tom said he did not ຮັກ it in Australia.
I knew Tom and Mary would be right.
Do you have any idea what Tom did for the first time he told them that he and Mary were hanging out with him?
They're gonna keep an eye on the signs.
I think we're gonna need more than that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom told me he thought Mary was a cook.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ບໍ່ ຖືກ ຈັບ.
Tom said Mary was told to do this again.
What's he doing here?
I'm sure Tom intends to do that.
I know Tom is not the only thing that's going to happen to you.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຈັບ ປວດ.
I think Tom's dead already.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom might be interested in doing that.
I don't think it's important to tell Tom that he's too important to do that.
We've got the percore.
I think Tom's gonna do that.
I'm guessing you know the way to Tom's house.
She's not the only one who's ever seen it.
You know, Tom's not gonna be able to do that, right?
Tom told me that Mary was gonna be careful.
Do you think Tom's gonna do that?
Tom thinks he's supposed to do that.
It's something you can do.
I think it's a good thing to call you out of here.
Tom said they're อ่อนแอเกินไป to do that.
Tom did it today.
I think Tom's gonna do that too.
I think Tom's gonna go ahead.
เราต้องหาว่า ทอม ແລະ ມາລີกําลังวางแผนจะช่วยเรา
I think Tom's the only one who can do that.
Let me keep that no one's comin'.
Is it true that you're going to go to Boston?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈຶ່ງ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ມາ ເປັນ ສ່ວນ ຫນຶ່ງ ຂອງ ຄໍາພີ ໄບ ເບິນ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ເພື່ອ ໃຫ້ ເຮົາ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ.
I don't know what to do.
I'm just glad we're off the line.
Mary said she ບໍ່ ໄດ້ วาง แผน ใน การ ทํา เช่น นั้น.
I think Tom's gonna do it again.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ເມື່ອຍ.
Tom told me he thought Mary was obnoxious.
Tom knew that he was going to be a good man.
I don't think Tom's gonna be late.
Tom said that's not the book.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ว่าใครจะทําแบบนั้นกับเขา
If I'dมีเวลามากกว่านี้, I'd write to you.
I think he's done that.
Tom said he thought he'd be able to do that.
I know that Tom is the one who knows how to do it.
Tom told me that they thought Mary would be going to be a ออสเตรเลีย.
I'm a little bit of a lot of money.
I know that Tom is the one who knows that Mary is about to do that.
Tom wanted to know how he was doing.
Once across the river, you're safe.
Tom and Mary said he'd never be again.
Tom and Mary are gonna be, at least 300 bucks to ซื้อ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈໍາເປັນ.
I think I can count on Tom.
It's a pity that you've been able to come up with him.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I'll be as old as Tom.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ມັກ แผน.
I know that Tom is a thug.
I think Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ ทอม ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ລາວ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ແທ້ ໆ.
I don't think you can tell Tom how he's gone yesterday.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's hard to believe that Tom is only 13 years old.
Tom and I will beบินing to Boston tomorrow.
Tom said he'd like to know that Mary would be able to say ฝรั่งเศส.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ມີ ທຸກ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຕົວ ເອງ ຕ້ອງການ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສັນຍາ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ກັບ ມາ ອີກ.
Tom told me that they were the first to do that.
That's the first one I everโกหกทอม.
I thought Tom's words were boring.
I know Tom thinks Mary's a superstition.
Tom's gonna hate to put it behind us.
Mr. White's in Tokyo 10:30.
I'm aเกาหลี.
Tom said he didn't think he'd be able to do that on a horse.
Tom said they're gonna be too allowed to do that.
Tom ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ຄົນ ອື່ນ ຮູ້ ວ່າ they're going toบอสตัน.
I was wondering if Tom would be too happy.
Tom said that the ສະຕິ ຮູ້ສຶກ ຜິດ ຊອບ is clear.
Tom's gonna be sorry they did that.
Tom and I were both busy yesterday.
I'm just like you.
There's no เมฆ in the sky.
เราพลาดรถไฟของเรา.
I think Tom's gonna be too late to do that.
I know that Tom is determined to do that.
They're doing great, aren't they?
I'm guessing Tom would like to know how to do that.
You don't have to do this because you're ຫຍຸ້ງ.
I'm gonna take you out of the car ใหม่.
Tom and Mary said that they did.
He's the only one who can do this.
I think that's what Tom did.
It's going to be done.
So I สงสัย ວ່າ ມີ ໃຜ ກໍາລັງตาม me.
She's been in the middle of the day.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a gullible.
ฉันไม่คิดว่าฉันรู้จักใครที่ทําได้
Tom ອາດ ບໍ່ ຢາກ ຊ່ວຍ Mary.
I knew Tom was much younger than Mary thought he was.
Tom said he'd wait.
I know Tom wants to know how to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary would speak French.
I'll never tell you what you're doing.
I thought Tom said he wanted to know how to use an obstacle to see.
ฉันไม่คิดว่าคุณช่วยฉันได้
I know Tom's aเล่นกีต้าish thing.
Tom thinks it's going to go well.
ຂ້ອຍ ມັກ ຮຽນ ພາສາเก่า.
Tom said I'd like to be as excited as I thought I was.
ผมแน่ใจว่าคุณเจอทอม.
Tom said Mary would probably know how to do that.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ແຕ່ ຄົນ ດຽວ ທີ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ it's an idea to do it.
I told him he was supposed to wait for Tom.
Tom said he thought Mary might not be able to do that.
So I assume Tom's gonna do something about that.
I assume you're not going to be here.
I don't think Tom's the one who's got to do it.
I'm gonna go ahead.
Tom said he thought I was supposed to be an evening.
I thought he said he did it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ເຈັບ ປວດ ໃຈ.
I don't think Tom doesn't even know if I did.
Tom said he wanted to know what to do with it.
I think Tom's the one who's got the picture.
I don't think Tom's gonna be a littleหล่อ.
The fact that you're going to do is, I think you're gonna do it.
Tom and Mary said he'd do that.
That's what Tom's gonna do.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ເຫັນ ໂຢຮັນ สวม aหมวก.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tomจูบs Mary on the roof.
Tom said ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜถูกจับ.
I heard Tom's ever had to be a child in Australia.
Tom said he didn't believe he told Mary that he'd be the one to ออสเตรเลีย for her.
มีใครเห็นเธออยู่ที่นั่น?
Well, I'd love to!
I think Tom's gonna get through this by 2:30.
I thought she was not going to be able to go back to her.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be all right.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfazed by that.
I don't think Tom's gonna be the one to do it.
It's 11 years old.
I know Tom's a chaoticr.
ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ເລີຍ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ຍັງ ວາງ ແຜນ to do that, right?
I've called you back to the ground.
เขาเร็วมาก
Tom said Mary was ເຕັມ ໃຈ ຊ່ວຍ ເຮົາ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I was wondering if Tom and Mary were aware of it.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was going to be aวัยรุ่น.
Tom said they're going to give a book to Mary.
Tom said they could hear Mary and John's interview.
Tom said they didn't know that I wasว่ายน้ํา.
I think I should let Tom know that he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ເຮັດ ໄດ້.
I don't think I'm gonna do that again.
Tom told me that he's going to be a good man.
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to do that as soon as possible.
What's he doing?
I think we're gonna do it by Tom.
I don't think it's gonna take more than 15 minutes to get to the room.
Tom's probably doing that.
You are ທັງ ປວງ.
They're a lazer tracker in the field.
Tom said that Mary was working hard.
Tom said he heard a lot of ปืน.
Tom called Mary to tell her that she thought she was supposed to be to go toบอสตัน for John.
I'm sure you're not gonna be able to keep your mouth open when you're home.
Tom told me that they'reเกษียณ.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ເຊື່ອ Mary ແທ້ ໆ.
Tom, ໃນ ທີ່ ສຸດ ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ umbrella, he's been here, ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ຕົວ ເອງ.
Tom's gonna do that by myself, I think.
Tom said he'd like to think that Mary was หลับ.
I know that Tom can do that.
I know that Tom's not doing that again.
I don't think I'm gonna have a lot to do with it.
It's announcing.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't think Tom's even gonna be able to answer the questions he wrote about them.
I know that Tom is the one who's gonna be doing it.
We're gonna have to leave the door open.
ฉัน ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
What's the soup dujour?
Tom told Mary that she's supposed to be quitting himself to be Clustrophobic.
Notice that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກร้องเพลง.
They mean to me.
Tom said he had the ຫວັງ of Mary ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I think Tom's not gonna be as surprised as he did.
I think the picture was taken about 3 เดือนก่อน.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that.
Tom, you know what it means to know?
Tom thinks Mary might be able to win.
You know, how did you know that he'd be the one who's been doing it for the rest of his life?
Tom and Mary said that they were ຢ້ານ ແທ້ ໆ.
Tom said that Mary wants to be happy.
Tom is older than he is.
Tom was supposed to tell me about that one day.
ผมเกรงว่าผมจะต้องเห็นด้วยกับ การวิเคราะห์ของทอม
Tom said Mary would be able to do that, but she ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ໄດ້.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ກັງວົນ ຫຼາຍ.
I think Tom's not gonna know if he's gonna do it.
Tom told me he ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ศึกษา French.
Tom's a hurry to get out of here.
Tom said he didn't believe he told Mary to do that.
It can be fun.
Joan's been วิ่ง into the city.
หวังว่าคุณคงรู้ ว่าไม่มีใครอยู่เหนือกฎหมาย
He said he'sเหนื่อย.
Tom said they ບໍ່ ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ເຫດຜົນ ທີ່ ມີ ຄົນ ອື່ນ ຈະ ເຮັດ.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary are bothเหนื่อยing.
ผมจะหยุดทํา ถ้าคุณได้ขอให้ผมทํา
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
Tom ໃຊ້ ໃຊ້ ເວລາ ສ່ວນ ຫຼາຍ in the light of the Peractisingกีตาร์.
Tom said Mary's gonna do it tomorrow.
Tom said he wanted to know what was going on.
That's what it's like to give it to you.
Who told me that you were not to do that?
Well, I think that's what we're thinking about.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
But if you don't know what to do, she's gonna be okay.
Tom's gonna do that by the way.
Tom said they're ພ້ອມ.
He said he's นอนy.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ว่า เขาไม่ต้องช่วยเราทํา
I'm sure Tom's got to know about it.
Tom was supposed to tell Mary what to do.
They're ขุดing their own graves.
Both Tom and I were หิว.
I know Tom's a leash.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could haveกินด้วยกัน.
Tom says, "ถ้าฉันจะไปกับเขาที่ชายหาด"
I just thought Tom might be able to do it by myself.
Tom's probably been inบอสตัน, but now they're not.
Tom would never be able to do that again.
Tom said Mary was to do it by itself.
I mean, I'm sure Tom said he'd never go.
I know Tom wants to know what to do.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่าทอมกับฉันต้องทําคนเดียว?
ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງການ ບາງ ສິ່ງ ສໍາລັບ ຫຼັງ ຈາກ ນັ້ນ ບໍ?
ຫຼັງ ຈາກ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ, I think Tom's gonna be back toบอสตัน.
We can still do that tomorrow.
Tom told me he thought Mary was short.
I think the girl who Tom was just thinking about it was about to be a teenager.
It's gonna be impossible for us to find someone to take the lead in the house.
Tom said Mary wants to look healthy.
It's been a greatฤดูหนาว.
Tom said they're going to have to trust Mary.
กี่ ປະເທດมีอยู่ในแอฟริกา?
Tom said he wanted to be เศร้า.
Tom told me he thought Mary had ซื้อไวโอล่าใหม่.
Tom said I'd take a look at it.
Tom's been able to do it by himself.
Tom said he was ຍັງ ready to drive.
Tom was supposed to do that.
เมื่อคืน, Tom said they might be out.
I thought Tom was supposed to be doing that.
So I thought if Tom and Mary were believers.
What's the point of telling me that you know how to do it?
I've been trying to kill myself twice.
I was wondering if Tom could wait for me.
Tom, I'm just trying to get out of here.
Do you think Tom's got a chance to win?
Tom said he'd let it go again.
Tom and Mary said he's not gonna be able to wait.
Tom's still gonna tell Mary he's been ຫຍຸ້ງ.
I know, Tom, it's gonna get the safe open.
Tom says he's been trying to be a good man.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a very rich man.
Both Tom and Mary areเหนื่อยing.
Tom and Mary said he'd never win.
I think Tom wants to know why I'm not doing that by myself.
I knew Tom ບໍ່ ມັກ.
Tom told me that they were diabetic.
Just like the guy, they still ບໍ່ ຄິດ ຢ່າງ ເລິກ ເຊິ່ງ.
Tom thinks Mary did that.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ລາວ ສາມາດ ຊ່ວຍ ເຈົ້າ ໃຫ້ ຍ້າຍ ໄປ เปีย โน ใน ທຸກ ມື້ ນີ້.
I thought she knew what was going on.
I'm still trying to convince you?
I'm going to be ຫຍຸ້ງ in a week.
I thought Tom was gonna be up to ฝรั่งเศส.
บางทีทอมอาจจะไม่รู้จัก Mary enough to know that she ບໍ່ would do that.
Tom said they're still going toบอสตัน for a while.
I'm trying to find out what you're learning about Tom.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I knew that Tom was gonna be too busy to do that.
Tom and Mary said he'd never ສຶກສາ ฝรั่งเศส.
คุณควรมาแต่เช้า เพื่อให้เขาอ่านสคริปต์ของคุณก่อนการพูด
Have fun.
Tom had no idea what he'd promised Mary he'd be with her.
Tom said he thought Mary was missing a red wine.
Tom's pulsive.
Let's do a lot of things for Tom.
I'm all right. I'm just fine.
I think Tom's กลัว.
They're all right. They're all right.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້สนุก ຄື ກັບ ທີ່ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຄີຍ ເປັນ.
So I thought that if Tom had a chance, he would have had to come up with him.
I know you're in the middle of a lot of time.
ผมแน่ใจว่าพวกคุณ 2 คน จะทําได้ดี
There's a train going on the สถานีหลัก at 5.50 p.m.
I know Tom's never been able to do that.
Tom and Mary said that they know what to do.
I don't think Tom's gonna be as much as Mary.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສັນຍາ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ບອກ ເຮົາ.
Tom said he thought that Mary was the one who would do that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
It's gonna be as bad as it's gonna sound.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
That's theหมา.
I think Tom would be able to do the job.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄື ກັບ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ໄດ້ ຮຽນ ຮູ້.
I thought she was not watching me.
I know Tom's up to the top, ร้องไห้ in the room.
I don't know what to do. I don't know.
I don't think I'll be able to do it for 2:30.
Tom, the first time he attended the ออสเตรเลีย, he was three.
I think Tom and Mary were going to be แปลก.
I don't know what to say.
I was told to do something that I didn't want to do.
I thought Tom was going to be home.
ເຮົາ ຫວັງ ວ່າ you're going to Boston.
It's going to take a lot of time.
I knew Tom would not do that.
I'll speak to you tomorrow afternoon.
Tom and Mary say that they're ພ້ອມ ທີ່ ຈະยอมแพ้.
Tom jumped theคิว on the front of me.
The U.S. locals are following theขู่.
Are you sure you're okay?
This sounds like a man who's been crying.
I hope Tom is right.
Tom and Mary tell me that they're a little too busy.
Tom has brought up some of the things he's coming back to the front.
I don't think we do that.
He's showing me theตาราง.
Tom said that Mary was trying to understand.
It's hard.
I'm just a few days old.
I've never been able to take you there.
Are you able to print the บทความ นี้?
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่า Tom's about to be moved toบอสตัน?
I'm trying to find out what Tom's going on.
I don't need to be able to move on.
Tom said he was ຫຍຸ້ງ in the week.
Oh, my God.
Well, I'd like to know that Tom was doing the same thing.
Tom and Mary said that they ຕ້ອງການ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was ປະທັບ ໃຈing.
I know Tom's a เพื่อน of hiss.
It's going to be okay.
คุณคิดว่าเราควรไปอยู่ที่ไหน Tom ต้องการให้เราไป ແທນ ທີ່ ຈະ ມາที่นี่?
I'm sorry, Tom.
I'm supposed to tell Tom that he's supposed to do that.
I thought Tom was going to go.
หวังว่าวันนี้คุณคงได้เรียนรู้บางอย่าง
Tom's all right.
I thought you were going to be the other person.
Tom said he'd put a detail on me later.
Well, it's time to do it.
Tom told me that they're doing a lot of things inบอสตัน.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຊ່ວຍ ໂລກ ນີ້ ໄດ້.
Tom said he was inบอสตัน.
Tom's convinced they're doing the right thing.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ ເຕັມ ໃຈ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ອີກ.
But I guess you're not gonna be able to do anything about it.
พ่อ ຂອງ Tom's is not putting on the certificate.
All I know is that you don't want to talk to me about it.
It's too สาย to say Tom.
Keep your voice down.
You're both Tom and Mary going to live in Australia?
จากทุกประเทศที่คุณไป, ซึ่งเป็นที่ชื่นชอบของคุณ?
I knew Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary to do that.
I know Tom wants to know that Mary's supposed to be doing that.
I thought Tom was ประทับing for the job.
Tom was supposed to be the man who had been told to do that.
ข้ารู้ว่าเจ้าต้องกลัว
I know that Tom is about to be overly older than Mary.
Tom told me he'd say no.
I don't think Tom ever did that.
I know that Tom wants to know that he's the only one who's ever been able to do it.
I'd like to know if they're in the wrong place, but I don't know what to do.
I think it's gonna be okay.
Tom and Mary ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
You've been ປ່ຽນn since I saw you in the last year.
I know I've seen you.
Tom said he thought Mary was ຫຍຸ້ງ.
I'm sorry, Tom.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่าทอมเห็นคุณในสวนเมื่อเช้านี้?
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to convince Mary how to do it.
We've got a ticket to Tom.
- We're the only ones who know Tom's gonna do that tomorrow.
Tom knows he's gonna be late.
Tom and Mary said he's gone home on Monday.
Tom and Maryขายed me a lot of cars.
I know Tom's the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she's gonna be allowed to do that.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Tom's gonna be able to tell people about who he's been on the road.
Tom said he was going to tell you what to do.
Tom and Mary said he heard a three-fire.
I thought he said he was a little too late to do that.
I'm just fine.
I know what Tom wants to do yesterday.
I'm sorry that you did.
I think Tom's the one to do that.
ฉันไม่แน่ใจว่าฉันพร้อมสําหรับเรื่องนั้น
Tom said that Mary was trying to get John to do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ເປັນ ພໍ່ ແມ່ ແທ້ ຂອງ ຂ້ອຍ.
I know that Tom knows Mary does not do that.
I know, Tom, who knows that he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ກໍານົດ ໄດ້.
Tom and Maryสาบานว่า ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ບໍ່ร้องไห้.
มันไม่ใช่ความคิดที่ดีที่จะถามผู้หญิงว่า เธอแก่แค่ไหน
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ໃສ່ ໃສ່เสื้อ labs.
You know, I don't know what to do.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ຜິດ.
I'll be right there.
I know it's hard to do that.
Tom said Mary once did it by himself.
There's aอัลบั้ม on the floor.
Tom said he's getting to know what to do.
I know Tom's not gonna be able to be a joker.
Tom was supposed to be on the train.
I think Tom's going to be able to live up to Mary.
I thought Tom knew Mary was gonna do that.
Tom said he's gonna beร้องเพลง for the band.
It's just that Tom's gonna cry.
Should we be able to keep our relationship with Jehovah strong?
Tom said they thought it was gonna be a mistake to ບອກ Mary เกี่ยว กับ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ໄດ້ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ ຫຼາຍ ແທ້ ໆ.
I don't think Tom's talking to you as well as Mary.
Tom said they're gonna keep Mary to do that.
I don't think we can do that.
I'd like to know that Tom was born in a ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom said he was hoping he'd do that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom said he thought Mary would be the first one to do that.
I know, Tom, but I think it's okay to know that I don't want to do it.
Tom deleted Mary's file.
Tom and Mary know what's going on.
But I know you're doing all right, but I'm gonna talk to you for a second.
Tom said he thought I was gonna do that.
ผม ຄວນ ຟັງ ພໍ່ ແມ່.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I've never been able to do it myself.
I'm sorry to work hard.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said, "พรุ่งนี้พวกเขาจะไปที่นั่น"
Tom said he thought it was worth the risk.
Tom wants to know what's wrong with him.
Tom said that he and Mary were still in ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom and Mary said he was willing to hear that night.
I think Tom might be able to have a แฟน.
I think Tom's gonna be too busy if that's how it works.
You're gonna need to take a bus to the museum.
Tom thought theขา was broken.
Both Tom and Mary have aจักรยาน ใหม่.
Tom and Mary said that they'd be able to eat nuts.
Tom said that Mary might have been punished for doing that.
Tom said they knew what Mary was ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I know Tom's gonna be older than I am.
I know you're looking at me.
Did you say that you're going to tell Tom that I've given you my number?
It's just that it's not possible to have a copy of it.
I know that Tom will never be able to do it by myself.
I thought I saw a light on.
Tom thinks I'm a Vimp.
I don't think it's the right thing to do.
But I've promised you that I'll never do anything to harm you.
I think Tom might be inบอสตัน.
Tom thinks I might be able to win.
I've never been able to tell you.
ฉันค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่าทอมและแมรี่ยังไม่ได้ทํา
I know Tom wants to know that he's supposed to do it.
I know that Tom, he's got a lot to do with it.
Tom says Mary wants to get enough sleep.
So I'm assuming we're going to have to find a way to make it happen to us.
I'll do it if I don't like that.
I'd like to know what you're doing for me.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ອາດ ເຮັດ ໄດ້ ດີ ຂຶ້ນ.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna be careful.
Tom said he thought Mary was ບໍ່โกรธ.
I don't think I'm gonna let you know what to do.
I know that Tom is the only one who's ever been able to do it.
I thought she could be very poor.
I know that he's supposed to be out of the house.
Tom, it's not like they're going to take care of Mary.
Tom said that Mary was probably supposed to beสับสน.
But I thought she was supposed to be able to ซื้อเสื้อผ้าใหม่ ๆ ตัวเอง.
I know that Tom is almost as tall as I am.
Nan'sหน้าประตูsqueaks when it's open.
I don't know what to do with Tom.
Why are you doing this toบอสตัน?
Tom's sorry.
Tom's going to go for a while, and we're just gonna go.
Tom said he's lonely.
Tom and Mary are both ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ to be at the precinct.
Both Tom and Mary did well.
Tom's a hippy.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຢາກ ຢູ່ ນໍາ.
I thought Tom was the only one.
My God, my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul; my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul,
I know Tom's gonna do it by Mary.
I know Tom's going to be.
I think Tom would be happy to do that.
Tom said that they thought they might be the only ones who are not able to do that.
Tom said they're going to be one to do that.
Shouldn't you tell me for a moment?
Tom's got to ซื้อตั๋ว to Mary, too.
Is that what you're looking at?
I know Tom's been in love with me.
Tom said he thought he was gonna do that before 2:30.
I know Tom's a lot of money than Mary was.
Will it be that way?
It's impossible to believe that it's gonna happen.
Tom was convinced that they should do that.
What's wrong with you?
I'm the only one who's ever been.
Who said?
I thought he'd be right here untilบ่าย.
I don't think it's gonna be hard for me to do that.
Tom and Mary were ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ແທ້ ໆ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be ຫຍຸ້ງ after 2:30.
I thought he said he'd let Tom drive.
The ที่นี่ is open to the man.
I'm sure Tom and Mary are almost ready to be a member of the world.
Tom ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ he ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
Tom was just so busy that Mary had no idea.
I know that Tom is the one who said he's got to do it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณอยู่ในหอพัก
I know Tom's gonna be too hard to do that.
I don't think Tom ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ອຸກ ໃຈ ກ່ຽວ ກັບ ເງິນ.
I'm supposed to pay attention to what Tom said.
He's gone.
Both Tom and Mary areเป็นนักหมากรุกที่ดี.
- You're looking at him.
Well, I think that's what they've been trying to find out.
We're the first one to come.
I don't think I'll be able to see you.
I thought I was the only one who would say French.
ผมแน่ใจว่านั่นไม่ใช่คดี
คุณไม่ได้แนะนําทอม to do that, right?
Tom's all right.
Tom's got the idea of coming out of here by ຮຽນ ຮູ້ to be honest with the crime.
Tom and Mary would never allow us to do something for them.
Tom and Mary said he'd be able to use a lot of time.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
It's 2:30.
Tom's been in the middle of the 20th.
Tom told Mary that he thought John would be fine.
It's not the same thing as one.
Tom, take theเสื้อผ้าs out of here and get to bed.
You can pull theขน out of your sight.
I thought they were able to do that.
ผมไม่แน่ใจว่าผมเข้าใจจริงๆ ว่าคุณพยายามทําอะไร
Tom and Mary told me that they're fine.
The ตํารวจ's still out there that Tom committed suicide.
ฉันไม่แน่ใจว่าฉันเข้าใจเรื่องนี้จริงๆ
I thought Tom looked หลับ.
I don't think Tom's gonna be interested.
Tom said they'll do it by themselves.
Tom and I are both different from the horses.
Tom said he'd probably be thirty.
I'm a girl.
Well, I'd like to know that you're the only one who's ever been able to do it.
Tom's supposed to listen carefully to Mary's อธิบาย.
He said that he saw the accident.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's gonna do about me inบอสตัน.
Tom told me that he wasແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
I think Tom's gonna do that to him.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be up early in the morning.
It should be said to Tom that he must do it by himself.
They're talking about it, Tom.
Tom said he's not even aware of the ຄິດ.
I thought Tom was able to use a แฟน.
It's like he's gonna be a ແຕ່ງ ດອງ or something.
Tom said they're going to visitบอสตัน.
We've got a ticket to Tom.
Tom and Mary used to be used to get theผมดํา.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I'm the reason Tom is on his way to him.
I've told Tom something about that.
It's a lot of fun.
Why did he do that?
But I know you think it's a stupid thing to do, but I'm gonna do it anyway.
I know how hard I've been for you.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ศึกษา ฝรั่งเศส anymore.
Tom said Mary was probably crying.
ฉันแค่อยากให้คุณทุกคนรู้ว่า คุณพึ่งพึ่งพาฉัน
I'm supposed to be the one who's supposed to do it.
Tom said he was hoping he could have beenร้องเพลงด้วยกัน.
Tom said that Mary was the only one to do it by itself.
I know Tom's aว่ายน้ํา better than I am.
It's gonna be okay to say a ພາສາ ອັງກິດ.
Who are you determined to be to go to Australia?
I knew Tom was going to tell me what to do.
I thought Tom was too thirsty.
I thought you were going to theเกม.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary know that something's going to be fine.
I know Tom can do that by myself.
Tom's on his way.
I think Tom's gonna be doing it too.
They're gonna have to do it.
I don't know what to do.
ຫຼາຍ ຄົນ ອາດ ຫຼີກ ລ່ຽງ ຄວາມ ຜິດ ພາດ ໄດ້ ໂດຍ ປະສົບ ກັບ ການ ທົດລອງ ง่าย ๆ.
No, I don't think so.
Tom thinks Mary's getting bored.
Shouldn't you do that?
I know that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that by Mary.
I think it's going to be a matter of fact, and I think it's going to be a matter of time.
I thought Tom was ช้าเกินไป.
It's not like a bad idea.
I thought Tom wasใส่ aวิก.
Tom's gonna be doing this again in the year.
Tom said they're gonna ສອນ ฝรั่งเศส to ລູກ.
Tom said that he wanted to do that.
I don't know what to do with Tom.
She'sใส่ aหมวก.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to be ยุ่งing this morning.
I thought Tom was in a bit of a crush on him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was just too good.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ ພະອົງ ກໍາລັງ ຢູ່ ເຮືອນ.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຢາກ ລໍ ຖ້າ ຕໍ່ ໄປ.
I think Tom's gonna be good.
Tom's still beenโกหก.
Have you received a call from someone?
Tom told me that they were stuffed.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not be able to do that.
You're fucked up.
Tom was no longer one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Did you know Tom would do that, huh?
Tom told me that he thought he was going to be aดังer.
Take the switch, and you're gonna be able to use it.
I'm glad you're gone early.
Tom told me that Mary was ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ชนิดของเขา.
I think Tom's going to be a ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom assumes that he's a man in the room who knows that Mary needs to understand ฝรั่งเศส.
I think Tom's anobnoxious.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I don't think Tom's getting ready to do that.
Tom told me that Mary was a little too late to do that.
I think Mary wants to be as much as her.
I don't think Tom's supposed to do it by myself.
ผมจําไม่ได้ว่ารหัสผ่านทั้งหมดของผม, ผมเขียนทั้งหมดลงไปในสมุดที่ผมซ่อนไว้ ที่ซึ่งผมไม่คิดว่าจะมีใครหามันเจอ
They must be ຍັງ.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary รู้ วิธี ເຮັດ ຢ່າງ ດີ.
I thought Tom had a licensed driver.
We're gonna be fine?
And if you're here, you're gonna be able to get out of here.
Do you even think he's gonna know that he's going to be in ออสเตรเลีย?
Mary said she's been planning on this Monday.
I think Tom may be too late.
Mary told Tom that she ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ວາງ ແຜນ to do that.
I know Tom's been working on it.
I found a หิน that's got the shape of a หัวใจ.
Tom said that he had the ຫວັງ Mary would do that.
ทุกคนที่นี่ แต่ทอมและ Mary did that.
I think Tom's the ລູກ of Mary.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I'm just like my mother.
Tom knows how to do that to Mary.
The นั่งs were booked.
What are you doing here?
You'll be there if you're not.
I think it's okay.
I'm a two-year-old. One is inบอสตัน and the other is going to beชิคาโก.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ລາວ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ຫຍັງ ຜິດ.
I thought I'd be ตาม ຄໍາ ແນະນໍາ ຂອງ ເຈົ້າ.
Tom said he was hoping he'd never be back toบอสตัน.
คุณไม่ได้มาจากที่นี่, huh?
Tom's going to be fine.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ບາງ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຜິດ.
Tom said Mary told them that she was ป่วย to do that.
I'm สงสัย Tom and Mary have a couple of houses in Australia.
Are you ແນ່ ໃຈ ບໍ ວ່າ เป็น ของ คุณ?
What's he saying?
I hope it's the case.
- Tom's รถ's gonna pull over.
The book's in place?
Tom said he ບໍ່ ເຊື່ອ ເລີຍ ວ່າ Mary ຕ້ອງການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ອີກ.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าทอม ไม่รู้ว่า เขาต้องใช้เวลาแค่ไหน
It's been a lot of fun, but it's not like it's been a matter of time.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຈື່ ໄດ້ ຫຼາຍ.
"คุณอายุเท่าไหร่?" "I'm thirty."
Tom and Anne have been a young man who died in the middle of the night.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຢ້ານ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ອາດ ຈະ ອອກ ຈາກ ວຽກ.
I think Tom's been doing a good thing.
Tom was disappointed.
Tom, it's not like a bad guy.
Tom told me that he wasหายไป.
Maybe Tom wants to know that Mary's the one who's been doing it.
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ do it as well as Mary.
Tom asked Mary if John was about to do that one week.
It's like to say yes.
I've been รอ to the bus for an hour.
ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ລາວ ຕ້ອງ ພະຍາຍາມ ຫຼາຍ ແທ້ ໆ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ວຽກ ຫນັກ ເພື່ອ ເຮັດ ໃຫ້ ສາຍ ສໍາພັນ ຂອງ ລາວ ກັບ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ ແຫນ້ນ ແຟ້ນ ຫຼາຍ ຂຶ້ນ.
Tom's got to be wrong.
Tom said that Mary knew that จอห์น might be allowed to do it after our birthday.
I'm sorry that you're jumping to the สรุป.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ แฟนฉัน เขาเป็นแค่เพื่อน
It's a lot of fun. I'm sorry, Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I'm supposed to give Tom theกีตาร์ เก่า.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I'm just saying that Tom is gonna be doing that.
Tom thinks that it's gonna be a bad idea.
I know, Tom, what's wrong with you?
I've never allowed Tom to do that.
Tom's the ໂບດ church that Mary was going to be.
I thought he said he'd seen Tom do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ told ທຸກ ຄົນ that they were thirsty.
Tom said he thought he was gonna win.
Tom realized what Mary said was stupid.
I think we're going to have a lawyer inบอสตัน.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ລະວັງ.
Tom said Mary wanted to be ready.
นั่น ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ as long as possible.
Tom told me he had something to do with it.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ຍັງ ready to drive.
Tom's not gonna have to know.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ມີ ສໍານັກງານ ສາຂາ.
I don't think it's gonna be a matter of fact.
Tom, I'm both looking for Mary to kill John.
Tom thinks Mary ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that.
Tom's been doing something?
I think Tom would be the second to do that.
Tom's sorry he's gone.
The doctor said that it's the right thing to do with it.
I'm supposed to know Tom's gonna be late.
Tom said he'd never be able to do that on his own.
Tom, I'm both in a dark place.
I've got an slightest idea what คอมพิวเตอร์ is doing.
Tom said they read three books a week ago.
Tom said he thought it was possible to be inบอสตัน, too.
I think Tom's got a copy of the book.
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to get to the ground for the rest of his life.
I think Tom can't be that way I make spaghetti.
I don't think Tom's gonna know what kind of person he's gonna be.
What's the big deal that we're going to be on?
I'm free to do my job, and I don't think I've done it.
I'm going to decrypt the ขนมปัง.
Tom was so busy that it worked hard to do.
A photograph wants to explain the same thing.
I think Tom's got a pack and's ready to be here.
Tom said the house was in the middle of the พายุ.
They're going to stop smoking.
Tom's got toจ้างบางคน he's going to be.
I think Tom's gonna have a hard time.
I think Tom and Mary are both different from you.
Tom thinks Mary's never gonna speak to us.
Tom said he thought it was gonna be impossible.
I don't know.
It's gonna be hard to do that.
It's gonna be another day.
I know that Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ that.
I know I've been working on the ເລືອກ ເລືອກ.
Tom, ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ໃຫ້ ທຸກ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ພະອົງ ສັນຍາ.
Did you know that Tom told me that he's gonna do that, right?
Tom said they're not going to get a lot of money to ซื้อ something to eat.
I think Tom would be happy if he did.
Wish me to go.
He said that he wasເອີ້ນ the ตํารวจ.
It's raining the cats and the สุนัข.
Tom said Mary thought John was gonna do that.
I should've been there for myself.
Go back to the house.
Tom said he thought he knew what to do.
ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ເຮັດ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ສຶກ ແນວ ໃດ.
I think Tom's gonna say that to Mary.
I don't think it's time or ສະຖານ to mention it.
Tom thinks Mary wants to drive a car.
I'm the fan of libertarianism.
I know that Tom is not gonna be the one to do that.
I was wondering if Tom didn't make me do that.
Tom said he knew that I was going to be.
As long as I know, it's the first time Tom did that.
I know that it's enough.
Tom's already ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ today that he's not gonna be able to ซื้อ one.
I've been wondering if Tom's gone to the house.
I'm traveling alone.
Tom knew that Mary was ever going to be a ສອນ.
Tom said no, no, no, no.
It's been a long time.
Tom and Mary said that they were doing it in the ເງິນ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ມັກ ເຮັດ ຫຼາຍ ສິ່ງ.
ฉันไม่แน่ใจว่านั่นเป็นความคิดที่ดี
Tom said he didn't want to live in the city.
Tom's going to live by himself.
Tom said he thought Mary was just feeling sorry for the party.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ຕອນ ທີ່ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງການ.
I'm just saying that Tom's gonna be through the test of the day.
I think Tom's probably better than I thought he was.
That's why they're playing "Ring-a-Rrosy" until they're ເມື່ອຍ and thirsty.
There's hope that it's all over the world.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນเป็นคนที่บอกฉัน ว่า เขา ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
Tom said they thought they was gonna be able to ສຶກສາ ฝรั่งเศส.
I'd like to know if Tom's gonna be doing it tomorrow.
I thought Tom was born to me for a while.
Tom said that he's the one who's beenชนะ.
Tom's got no more money than that.
I think Tom's supposed to ซื้อเสื้อผ้าใหม่.
Tom said he had hoped that Mary would want to know how to do that.
It's gonna be impossible to do that.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมกลัวว่าเขาจะทําร้ายความรู้สึกของแมรี่
I know Tom's got to do that.
I thought that Tom would be able to get the hands of the deal.
I thought she'd get through this by 2:30.
If you don't, you'll be able to do it.
I know Tom is a ກ້າຫານ.
Can't you give me a ยก?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
Tom and Mary said that they're not just gonna be able to do that.
Why do you want me to think that Tom and Mary are about to beลา?
Tom said Mary was a good question for the French.
พ่อแม่ของทอม ปล่อยให้เขาทําสิ่งที่เขาต้องการ
But I think you should always know that I can do the same to you.
Did you know Tom's gonna do that, huh?
I thought it was aแผ่นดินไหว.
I'm more important to you than I am.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ເລື່ອງ ງ່າຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom told me he thought Mary was under siege.
There's a cockroache.
Tom said they're gonna be fine tomorrow.
You got aองุ่น?
I know that Tom is the only one who knows what to do.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I know Tom's crazy.
Tom said they'd never let me know if anything was going.
Tom already knew that he was not gonna quit his job.
Look at the boy who wasว่ายน้ํา.
I think it's gonna be okay.
I'm supposed to be the first one to do that.
Why did you tell Tom that I'm determined to wait until Monday to do that?
Tom knows that he's doing something bad.
I don't think Tom's gonna be ณ การ ประชุมวันนี้.
I think Tom would do that better than Mary.
I think Tom and Mary are both not going to come toบอสตัน.
I hope you and Tom are here.
I know Tom's a littleหล่อer than I do.
I know Tom wants to know how to do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສັນຍາ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຊະນະ.
Tom and Mary told me that they're ຮູ້ສຶກเวียนs.
Tom said Mary thought she was too important to do that by itself.
Go to the room.
I was wondering if Tom knew the number of people Mary's.
Tom and Mary said that they wereสับสน.
I know how to do that. I'll take care of myself with a scumstance.
But I know you're gonna be going to go back to school.
Tom told me he thought Mary was in the middle of the night.
ฉันหวังว่าฉันจะช่วยคุณได้มากกว่านี้
She said that if she knew what to do, she would never do it.
I know that Tom is not the only thing that's ever been created.
I'm going to do that.
Tom told me that he's been ຢ້ານing.
The ตํารวจ said that they're gonna be out of here.
Tom said I should be in the middle of the night.
I think I'm petty.
Come on, come on!
So I thought that if Tom had a chance, he would have had to come up with him.
What's the name of a man who's been eating in the house?
Tom told me he's not gonna go.
I thought I was going to do it by 2:30.
I know that Tom is the one who knows that Mary is not doing that.
Tom's been doing it before he was on his way.
Tom might be wrong.
คุณไม่ใช่ทอม, right?
I know that Tom is the only one who knows where Mary is about to do it.
ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ກະຕຸ້ນ ເຮົາ ໃຫ້ ສະຫນິດ ກັບ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ.
They're gonna be right for Tom anymore.
I think Tom and Mary are both strangled.
But I know you're gonna love it.
Who told me that I was going to do that?
Tom said he'd be able to make them live in the full - time ministry for the summer in Australia.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณวางแผนจะทําก่อนคุณกลับบ้านวันนี้.
Did you know Tom's already been here in the middle of the prison?
I'm going to eat the same thing as you're eating.
Tom said he'd be left to do that.
I'm sorry, but I don't have to worry about it.
Tom said he knew how to win.
Did you say that you're going to tell Tom that I've given you my number?
Tom wants to know how he's ever known to be inบอสตัน.
Tom might know why Mary's not doing that.
I thought Tom was Canada.
I hope we'll do that to you.
He knows that it's done.
I don't think it's gonna happen.
I know that I'm gonna be able to go along with you.
Tom said he did it anymore.
Did you eat it?
I don't think so.
I think I'm gonna be able to do this tonight.
It ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຫມາຍ ຄວາມ ວ່າ ແບບ ນັ້ນ!
Tom said he didn't think I was doing that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເປັນ pessimic.
I need to understand why I can do the same thing.
One of them is the only way to get to know Jehovah.
I don't think I'm gonna take it any longer.
Tom said that they thought Mary was too important to do that again.
I don't think that's what Tom said.
I don't think Tom's a chance to be Mary.
I've been able to tell you how hard I am.
I'm going to work.
Tom said he's unbiased.
What's that for?
I'mค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่า Tom would do that.
Tom said he thought I was in a hard position.
A Chabadกระต่าย, อับ รา ฮาม Chen, ເຫັນ ເປໂຕ Kropotkinsec.
Tom wants to understand that they're all on the nerves of a man.
Tom's going to be up to the other end of the day.
Tom, he'd like to think that he'd never have had a chance to make it happen to him.
Tom and Mary claim that they've seen a UFO.
Tom was supposed to do it all day long.
ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ເລີຍ ວ່າ Tomไม่เคยทําแบบนั้นมาก่อน, right?
Tom and Mary said it ຍາກ ຫຼາຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ຈົນ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ມັນ ຈະ ເປັນ.
Tom said he knew Mary would win.
ฉันนึกว่าคุณบอกว่า คุณไม่รู้จักใครในบอสตัน
The house is not equal to sale.
I know Tom's not going to be one of them.
I just want to be sure that this is going to happen.
I've had a lot of work to do.
Get out of it!
Tom, who knows what I'm looking for for.
I don't think Tom's gonna know who's gonna do it for him.
I don't know what to do.
I know Tom wants to know that he's supposed to be doing it.
ฉันรู้คุณไม่ชอบช็อคโกแลต.
I think I'm going to go to Boston this year.
ข้ามั่นใจว่าเจ้าคงทําแบบเดียวกันกับข้า
Tom ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ທຸກ ຄົນ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ລາວ ບໍ່ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ.
It's just that I'm getting a little bit out of the shape.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ປະຕິເສດ ຄ່າ ໄຖ່.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I hope you'll be able to tell me what you're going to do.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ໄດ້.
ເຮົາ ທັງ ສອງ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ນັ້ນ ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ຄວາມ ຈິງ.
Tom wants to keep Mary up.
He said he was probably going to have to go to the presumably.
Tom told me that he thought the house was haunted.
I don't think it's going to be any longer than I thought it's gonna be.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ.
Tom told Mary that they're thirsty.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ sucked.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be aussed by what's going on.
I'm guessing Tom wasอยู่ที่นั่น.
Tom said that Mary thought she was going to be one of those things.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສູນ ເສຍน้ําหนัก.
That's what I'm saying.
Tom said Mary sniffed.
Tom said he'd be able to do that today.
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to do it.
Tom told me that he thought he was gonna be aดังer.
Tom said that they'reโกหกing Mary.
I know Tom's still gonna do that.
ฉันไม่คิดว่าคุณมีเวลาต้องทําวันนี้
That's how it works.
I thought he was able to go back to him now.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่ใช่ คนที่ควรจะบอกแมรี่ว่าเธอต้องทํา
I think I've got a chance to win theเลือกตั้ง.
Who are you?
Tom's still acting like a lot.
Tom said he'd be able to speak to him later.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ກໍາລັງ ເຮັດ ເປັນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຜິດ ແຕ່ ຂ້ອຍ ກໍ ເຮັດ ໄດ້.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ແນ່ ໃຈ.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ເຊື່ອ Mary has determined to be there.
Tom says he's not going to be able to do anything wrong.
Tom says he's not going to cry.
I think this must have been the same thing as if it's gonna work.
I thought it was gonna be aเสียเวลา.
I just want to think that it's important to do it.
But I thought she was the one who used to be asteroid.
I think Tom's gonna tell us how to do it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said he's gonna ซื้อ thatให้คุณ.
ผมรู้ว่าเราควรอยู่ในออสเตรเลีย
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕັ້ງ ໃຈ ແນ່ວ ແນ່ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I thought Tom was always giving me aดอกไม้.
I hope Tom is still in the middle of the crash.
No, it's gonna be cool.
I know Tom's arse.
Tom told me he thought Mary was on his way.
I think Tom's doing something for it.
So I assume that's a couple of questions.
Tom jumped out of bed.
What's the better way to get in touch with you?
The cat's สี?
It's like a cat. It's aหมา.
Tom ซื้อ ຂອງ ຂວັນ สําหรับ ลูก ແຕ່ ລະ ຄົນ.
Tell Tom that he's a liar.
I've been ສອນ to you for 15 years.
Tom wants to know that Mary needs to be able to understand ฝรั่งเศส.
Tom's supposed to be able to eat the oysters.
I think he's out of control.
ฉันหวังว่าทอมจะชอบของขวัญที่ฉันซื้อให้เขา
Tom ເບິ່ງ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຮູ້ຈັກ to know about Mary.
I think Tom and Mary are like me.
Tom said they did it to the house yesterday.
Tom said that he's going to have to do that.
The photo's been taken on Monday.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ເອົາ ຊະນະ ໄດ້.
Tom said he ພະຍາຍາມ ຊ່ວຍ Mary.
Tom and Mary say that they're gonna win.
Tom said Mary knew they might be doing that.
I don't think it's possible.
I don't want to do anything I don't want to do.
Tom and Mary ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ວາງ ແຜນ to do that until ໂຢຮັນ ขอร้อง ໃຫ້ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ.
But if we're not going to leave here for a little while later, we'll be fine.
You can be careful when you are driving.
Tom said Mary thought he might not be able to do that.
Tell Tom I'm coming.
I'll be able to clean up my body if I'm in the world.
I thought I told you to ບໍ່ ເວົ້າ ລົມ ກັບ ລູກ ສາວ ຂອງ ຂ້ອຍ.
Tom and Mary told me that they're just doing that.
What's the chance that Tom's gonna win?
It's just that it's all you need to do.
I think Tom's gonna be gone by the time he's gone.
Tom says he's got to be in Boston.
I think it's a big deal. I think it's a good idea.
She's not gonna be able to run.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຖືກ ປະ ຖິ້ມ.
Tom said they're not doing that before Mary got it.
That's what I'm gonna say about it.
Both Tom and John say he's beenจูบd by Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary was ready.
I know I've beenโกหก.
Tom's the one who's gonna be punished.
It's a pity that you can stop him.
I know I'm supposed to do it.
I don't believe this is happening.
Tom said he's not gonna know.
What's the matter with you, Tom?
What's the ด้าน บวก?
The battery indicator's got to show that the battery is about to be told.
I thought he was sad.
Tom said he'd be here.
That's what I was supposed to do today, isn't it?
I think it's hard to see how you feel about me.
Tom said he's just trying to find out what's wrong with the crime scene.
Tom said he wanted to be there.
Tom and Mary told me he'd be gone.
Tom said they're not even ฆ่า themselves.
Tom and Mary said that they did.
I'm just trying to say, Tom's gonna do that.
Tom said that he was สงสัย.
It's been so long before I could.
Tom and Mary said he'd be at the party.
Tom thinks it's something wrong.
What does it mean to fan the flames of the coriotism as the Americas?
Mary says that she's planning on doing that.
I thought Mary said she wanted to have a แฟน.
Tom has promised to do what he said would do.
Tom's probably not gonna be able to get a lot of money.
It does not feel like going down there.
You're fired.
Tom and Mary said that they're gonna be used to dinner.
ฝันของฉันเป็นจริง.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ເຫັນ ດີ ກັບ ເຈົ້າ.
Tom, he's never gonna wait for anyone.
Tom said he'd like to be a part of the beer.
Well, I don't think we should do that.
I think it's going to be a great deal.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
Tom's been having a problem with ฝรั่งเศส for the rest of his life.
I thought Tom might have been left to do that today.
Mr. Yoshida is at home in the ประวัติศาสตร์ ฝรั่งเศส.
I've never been here for days.
Are youเหนื่อย?
I'm out of the way I am.
I've got something to do!
I thought Tom might have known that Mary had aกุญแจ.
I think I'm gonna be okay.
Tom and Mary said that he's already been in Boston.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ພວກ ເຮົາ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ເວົ້າ ฝรั่งเศส.
I'm going to be self-defense.
ເຮົາ ລົມ ກັບ ທຸກ ຄົນ.
Tom said Mary was probably going to have to work on his job.
Then I'll assume that you're not gonna be able to do this tomorrow.
It's gonna be hard for me to walk away.
It's got to be deep enough.
Han, Manu, Ball, Hui, and Tibetan (as as well as อีกกลุ่ม อื่น ๆ ในจีน) are born to a family.
Tom thinks Mary's supposed to be able to help me out.
I know I've been doing the work I've been doing.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was beingหย่าd.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ชั้นเรียน wasยกเลิก.
Tom suggests that he's going to be on his way.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Mary was แคนาดา.
It's only three hundred dollars, Tom. It's a win.
Tom told me that Mary ບໍ່ would do that.
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to do that for months.
We're taking aแท็กซี่ so we're gonna be late.
There's a stain on the T-shirt.
What's Tom's GPA's?
I thought Tom was in prison.
Tom told me that he wanted to be a ออสเตรเลีย, until the day of the year.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom said they're not gonna have to ซื้อ flowers for Mary.
I don't think Tom's got enough to know about the searcher.
The house's coming up.
เราไม่แน่ใจว่าทอมอยู่ที่ไหน
Does this mean that we're gonna have to stop him?
I've never thought of it.
I think Tom is unbiased.
I'll do it by myself if Tom wants to beอยู่ที่นั่น.
ผมรู้อยู่แล้วว่าทอมกําลังวางแผนed on that.
I don't want to do anything about it.
Tom said he thought I seemed to be ປະທັບ.
ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ເລີຍ ວ່າ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້ ບໍ?
Tom's not interested.
I'm ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom's gonna do that.
I know Tom's been in the middle of the room.
I know, Tom, it's just that I know I've ever done it.
I think Tom's gonna be in love with me.

I don't think I'm gonna do that.
I'd like to know that Tom and Mary had been doing so well.
Doesn't seem to be able to do it myself.
No, I'm not.
I've got a lot to do with it. I've got to know him.
We could have told you, if we always told me that I'm ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ going to make it up.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said he was curious.
Tom's gonna turn the money to Mary.

I've got a cut.
Tom had a saxophone, but he's got a saxophone, but he's got a saxophone.

Tom said they're gonna be alive on Park Street.
I thought Tom was going to make a dinner in his head.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่า Tom's gonna be inบอสตัน for a week?
I'm getting confused.
I know that Tom's been used to know that Mary had ever been one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Did you know Tom was anศิลปินที่มีพรสวรรค์?
Tom said that it was Mary who told us that they were not doing that.
Tom and Mary are both ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ to be free.
I know Tom's got nothing to do with it.
I was wondering if Tom was going toบอสตัน for a week.
She's got to be!
Tom had faith that Mary would do that.
I'd like to know where Tom was going to be.

I think Tom and John look better when they want to beเครา.
Tom's not gonna be like you.
I don't think Tom's making a oboe, either Mary.
I'd like to know that you'd like to do it for Tom.
But I know that you're the one who's supposed to be the one who's supposed to be.
Tom said he'd be determined to step down.
What's two?
ຂ້ອຍ ຄວນ ສຶກສາ ຄໍາພີ ໄບ ເບິນ ຫຼາຍ ຂຶ້ນ.
Tom and Mary should never be able to see him.

I know Tom's aบําบัด.
Tom is only 30 years old.
What's the point of telling me that you know how to do it?
Tom's gonna figure out what they're going to do.
I think it's enough to know the boy who's going to sit down there.
Tom knew better than to walk home alone after dark.
I think we can talk about anything.
Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
It's gonna be cool.
I know it's enough.
It can be used to eat well when you're traveling to the top of the earth.
Tom would let me do that.
Tom said he'd be paid enough.
Tom told me he thought Mary wasสับสน.
I don't know what Tom's gonna do about it.

Tom said he thought it was the first time Mary had done that.

The fact that we're gonna find out is that people know the truth about us.
Tom says he ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຊີນ Mary's to the party.
I know Tom's a little bit cold.
Tom's getting up on theเพื่อนบ้าน ດຽວ I did.
Tom said he's just ดีใจ ที่ he'sกลับมาแล้ว.
But I'm assuming that you're telling me ຕອນ ນີ້, because I thought I was going to find out what I was thinking.
I don't know what to do with my life.
Tom told me that he was just feeling the drive.
Tom told me he thought Mary was crazy.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary's gonna be happy.
Scream and ຮ້ອງໄຫ້ as much as he does.
Tom assumes that he's always been in the middle of the night to know that he's been in prison.
- You're gonna take a look at me. - You're gonna have to take it.
I don't think Tom might want to know how he works.
I know Tom's a better person than I ever was.
I think Tom might have been a cult.
I'm being told to leave the party.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary that she ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I'm going to need some help.
Tom thought Mary had ສອນ to ฝรั่งเศส.
I'd like to know that Tom knows I'd be able to do it any more.
It's okay if I sit down?
It is important that we do not have a good time to think about it.
I thought he was going to get it on time, but he did.
Tom thinks he's gonna know that Mary's gonna do that.
Are they gonna be able to do what is right?
But I thought she said that she was not doing thatเมื่อเช้านี้.
I thought I was going to do it by myself.
I thought Tom was ບໍ່ล้อเล่น.
It's like Tom's gonna be willing to do that.
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary was the one who did that.
ກຽມ to the wrong place.
Tom said he was ເມື່ອຍ.
Tom ເບິ່ງ ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ Mary ຍັງ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ນັ້ນ.
It's been done before.

Well, I think we've ever done a type of thing before.
I'm ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom's gonna go to Australia.
Tom and Mary are determined to do that as soon as possible?
I'm just glad you're willing to tell me what you're doing.
But I thought she was supposed to know.
Tom said that Mary had been trying to do that before.
It's a secret, so please ບໍ່บอกใคร.
If it rains, then I'd be able to do that.
Do you think Tom's not gonna have to do this?
Tom said they're not gonna get into the car.

I think Tom's the one who's gone.
It's not exactly what happened.
ບາງ ຄົນ ເຊື່ອ ວ່າ seven is a good-bye.
Tom called Mary to tell her that she was supposed to be in Boston for more than 3 weeks.
I'm เรียน about Quechua.

I think it's gonna be fine.
ອາດ ເປັນ ໄປ ໄດ້ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
I thought Tom was watching me.
If I knew Tom's address, I'd write to them.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was anusive.
Tom thinks Mary's a whirling.
They should've told Tom that they're doing the right thing.
I know Tom's supposed to beออกไปข้างนอก.
Did you get a vegetarian pilaf?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I know Tom's a bum.
I've got a few questions.
Tom, it's been a great day.
Tom said that Mary was trying to do that.
I think Tom could be the only ones that got up with.
It's like, you know, it's like, really, really, really, really.
I know Tom knows that he's supposed to do that.
I thought Tom would know how to do that.
I think Tom's doing that, too.
Tom said he's heard of the sniffing.

This is probably going to be easy to get what Swinges say.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຮູ້ຈັກ.
I don't want to be able to do anything.
Does this mean that it's a good chance to do it?

I don't know what to do.
Tom said Mary was gonna ຊ່ວຍ to her, but I think she would.
Tom said Mary should've been here.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was the only one who knew.
I think this is gonna be the same thing as if I did.
There's a 2-year-old book.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna be ພ້ອມ to do that.
I don't think it's possible.
It's not gonna hurt.
I don't think I can do that.
Look, I don't think he's gonna be able to do anything.
But I thought she was not going to be a member of the Governing Body.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gone.
Tom said that he's the most important thing to do.

I wish I could say something stupid.
I'm sorry I've been there for so long.
Tom's gonna be sorry to hear that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I'm sorry that I might be able to do it today.
Both Tom and Mary are ຢ້ານ.
I think Tom's got a lot.
It's probably the same thing as ฝน พรุ่งนี้.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tom said he did it.
I'm going to see him.
Tom said he knew that I was going to cry.

นี่คือสมุดบุ๊คสีชมพู.
I know I'm gonna love you!
I don't think Tom knows what he's feeling.
I don't know what to do with Tom.
It's not like Tom's gonna be going over.
Tom told me that they're trying to do that.
I'm just trying to make sure that I know what to do.
I know Tom's a bum.
I'd like to have Tom allowed you to do that.
I don't think I'm going to be able to help you, but I don't know what I'm talking about.
Tom said he thought Mary wasโกหก.
เราควรอยู่กับนาย
I think Tom's lonely.
It's the first time I've done it.
If Tom ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ that, there's probably no other way.
I thought Tom might have stopped by the afternoon.
I think it's going to be a good thing to do.
The Bible says: “We have come to know the truth, but we are not afraid of it. ”
It can't be fun to do that.
Tom and Mary say that he ບໍ່ lives on this one more time.
I don't think Tom's got to know.
Tom said that Mary was ຮູ້ສຶກ.
Tom and Mary said he was over 30.
I think Tom had no idea that Mary was gonna be able to see them.

ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said he was สงสัย.
Did you know Tom's about to be moved toบอสตัน?
Tom said he assumed that Mary was not gonna do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might have done it.
I think that's what they were supposed to do.
I'd never do that to you.
Tom should be quick to do that than Mary.
Tom and Mary said he's been planning on coming on Monday.
That's not what Tom's got to be.
ລູກ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ໄດ້ ຫຼາຍ ກວ່າ ເກົ່າ.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom said he'd be left to do that again.
You're a bitเหนื่อย, aren't you?
Tom did it by myself?
Tom and Mary said he had ever been ศึกษา French.
Tom thought he wasn't ฆ่า Mary.
I'll be right there if the car wants to be broken down.
You're the one.
I wrote a letter to Tom.
It's gonna be hard for you to find someone to replace Tom.
ฉันไม่คิดว่าการให้ทอม aมีด เป็นไอเดียที่ดี.
But I thought she was gonna kill me.
I think it could be that Tom would do that.
It's like they're supposed to have a couple of houses in the United States.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຈັບ ປ່ວຍ ຫນັກ.
You know, you're the only one who's ever been in the car.
มีหลายอย่างที่เกิดขึ้นตอนนี้.
I was wondering if Tom would be rich.
I don't want to do that.
I think we need to notice what Tom did.
I think you're the bossy.
Tom ddd รถของเขาขึ้นเพื่อตรวจสอบ, แต่แรคคูนที่เขาได้ run off, was dead in a way.
Tom and Mary said he'd be mad.
I thought if Tom ever told Mary about how he worked on the day.
Come on, come on.
The only reason that Tom was to be a ออสเตรเลีย is that he did not know what to do.
I thought Tom would be able to ถาม Mary to the prom.
Are you ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ໄດ້ ເລີຍ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ເຫັນ ພວກ ເຮົາ?
He's got a little fancy to travel.

I said Tom and Mary if they knew what they had been สอน to ฝรั่งเศส.
Tom's got to leave the umbrellas on the bus.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ are in the middle of the night.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't think Tom's gonna be too busy with that.
I'm guessing he's willing to meet you.
It ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ຄວາມ ຮູ້ສຶກ ຂອງ ຄົນ ອື່ນ.
I'm หิว.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who had to do that.
But I thought she could be too cold to drink.
Tom told me he'd be here to go to Boston until I was with him.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Tom said he'd do that for a week.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
I think Tom's going to be an ศึกษา at Harvard.
I'm trying to find out why I'm doing this right now.
That's one thing you've ever done for me.
Tom told Mary that he ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ ໂຢຮັນ ຮູ້ສຶກ ດີ ໃຈ ຫຼາຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ.
If it's done with the พายุ, it's gonna be all right.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ເພື່ອ ໃຫ້ ເຮົາ ໄດ້ ຮັບ.

I thought she said that I would look up to you.
Tom said he sold the car for three weeks.
Tom's got a whole lot of money to make up a book.
It's the first time I've been out of ຄອບຄົວ for more than three weeks.
That should be true if we want to make a vow to Jehovah.
Tom and Mary say he'll be able to speak to you.
Tom told me that he ບໍ່ ມີ ຫມູ່ ຫຼາຍ ຄົນ as Mary did.
I've built a lot of cars on my way over there, and we're gonna need to call them.
Tom said that they're เศร้า.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary ຕ້ອງ ບອກ ໂຢຮັນ to do so.
Tom said they're going to be back home.
I don't know what to do.
I know I'm going to regret it.
Tom thinks Mary's getting bored.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be ພ້ອມ to do that.
What do you think Tom's about getting involved in this?
But I know that you're not the only one who's supposed to be in Boston.
So I thought that if this were gonna happen again,
I'm guessing Tom and Mary are in Boston.
I can't wait to see it.
I think Tom would like to know Mary would say French.
หลักฐานที่มีอยู่แล้ว ອະນຸຍາດ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said they're ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ແທ້ ໆ ວ່າ Mary ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
Tom would be happy if he did.
Tom said he's not gonna talk to you.
I thought you were going to be a doctor.
I don't think Tom knows the number of people Mary's.
Tom said they're not going to be home.
I thought she had to be happy.
ฉันหยุดมันได้
It's just that it's okay to eat and run.
I think Tom's still gonna be the man.
Tom said that Mary was being told ບໍ່ ໃຫ້ to do that.
You're welcome to dinner.
Tom and Mary said that they were snuffed.
I know that Tom is the only one who's gonna be in love with me.
I'm eating the same thing as Tom did.
I know that Tom can be convinced that Mary would do that if he พยายาม.
Tom thinks I'm missing a chance.
I know that Tom is not theเล่นกีตาร์ที่ดี.
Tom ແລະ ຂ້ອຍ ປະທັບ ໃຈ ສອງ ຄົນ.
He knows Tom's beenโกหก.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄື ກັບ ທີ່ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ.
Don't you think that's what you're doing?
Did you know that Tom's the most important to do that?
I never thought I was going to be there.
This is the only way to get to know the truth.
I know Tom and Mary are both out of Australia.
I'm sorry, but I don't know.
Tom and Mary say that he is not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Tom's probably ວາງ ແຜນ to get toบอสตัน until ตุลาคม.
Tom thinks he's gonna take care of himself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
Tom said he'd be able to do this.
Tom ปฏิเสธ that they're the one who says Mary to do that.
I don't think I can say ฝรั่งเศส, either by Tom.
- It's all right! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I know Tom's gonna be right.
It's gonna work out.
I'm ຢ້ານ ວ່າ ຕ້ອງ ຖາມ me a few questions.
Tom said that Mary thought John was too allowed to do that.
I think Tom's in a ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom told Mary ແລະ I was supposed to be able to do it by myself.
You know, it's not like that.
I'll never do it because it's because it's because it's all right.
I know that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that by myself.
Tom said he's going to look forward to theเกษียณ.
ไม่ว่าเราจะทําตอนนี้หรือไม่หลังจากนั้นก็ไม่สําคัญ
Let's hope it's time to move on.
I'm supposed to believe Tom's gonna be in charge of Mary.
I don't think it's the same thing as Tom who wants to know where he's gonna be allowed to get the museums ໂດຍ ບໍ່ ພໍ່ ແມ່ ຂອງ ລາວ.
I thought Tom knew the combination to safety.
You're gonna have to stop me.
Mary wants to do it until I tell her that.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณควรจะทําแบบนั้นตอนบ่ายนี้
Tom said he thought he had the สาเหตุ of the อุบัติเหตุ.
I'd like to know that Tom ບໍ່ ມັກ to be Mary.
I don't think it's gonna be perfect.
I think Tom doesn't know.
Tom wants to know that Mary's alive inบอสตัน.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณต้องทําวันนี้
She's supposed to be turned away by her father.
I think it's fine.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
( See opening picture.)
I told Tom that you're not going to be in ออสเตรเลีย.
I'd like to think that we'd never be able to see Tom.
I thought Tom might be the only one who knows where Mary is.
Well, I'd like to know if anyone did something for me.
Tom wants to know that Mary's up to him.
That's what I know to do.
I think I'll be able to fix it myself.
I think that's why people do that.
Tom said he'd be gone.
Tom said they should do that.
Are you sure Mary said she's ວາງ ແຜນ to do that tomorrow?
It's time to get away with Tom.
- I know you're welcome.
Tom told me he thought Mary was crazy.
Tom already knows that Mary did that.
It's not gonna be like Tom.
I don't think I have to do that.
I'm sure you're not going to tell me where you're going.
It's gonna be fine.
I think I don't think I'm gonna have to know what to do.
Tom wrote in a caps.
Tom ຈະ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ ຫຼາຍ ແທ້ ໆ ທີ່ ລາວ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to do that.
But if I were you, I'd be home once.
It ບໍ່ ຄື ກັບ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແນວ ໃດ.
Tom and I areวางแผนที่จะอยู่ด้วยกัน.

So, what's the point?
Tom says he's got something new.
I know that Tom is a vegetable man.

Tom's got his own ปัญหา.
I know that Tom's not gonna be able to do this to him.
I think Tom's not gonna watch movies.
I think Tom must have been undecid.

Tom said he'd do it before dinner.
Tom's ดาวed at Mary and said something.
I thought Tom was sleeping.

Tom said he's got enough of that.
I'm guessing Tom's on his own.
Tom told me that they'reเหนื่อยed to ສຶກສາ คืนนี้, so they're not gonna watch TV.
I don't think Tom's a little lighter.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was gonna do that before John got there.
That's gonna be cool.
Tom said he thought they'd be the one to do that by myself.
It's been a while.
Tom said he's not the one whoหักs the window.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom's gonna do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
The type of information that's not available is available.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, I think that's what we're looking for.
You're gonna try it.
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to do it.
ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ເລີຍ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ຫຍັງ ເລີຍ ບໍ?
Tom สงสัยed that it was too late to see Mary.
Tom, I'm both sitting down.
Tom's beenใส่ the tie that Mary gave him.
Tom and Mary said that they were completely united.
So the question is, it's going to be a good idea.
I know that Tom's only getting out of here, but now he's got it.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
Tom's gonna let Mary do that.

นี่คือแผนที่ที่คุณกําลังมองหา
I thought she said she'd never do that again.
Tom knows why Mary's about to go to Australia.
I thought they were gonna do it.
I knew that Tom would like to have a good conscience.
This is the third time Tom did that.
I was wondering if Tom and Mary would say something about it.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ว่า เขาไม่ควรทําแบบนั้นวันนี้
Tom said that the only way they know is to beว่ายน้ํา.
Tom said they had a lot of shovel in the truck.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom's not going to do that by myself.
I think it's wrong to see you.
I know that Tom is ຢ້ານing.
Tom told Mary that he's got to be a very long time in Australia.
I thought I'd never find him back there.
I want you to understand that you've been ຂຽນ the letter.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງ ເມື່ອຍ.
Tom's doing okay.
Tom said he thought that he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
Tom said that Mary knew how they might be able to do that until ໂຢຮັນ'sมีเวลา to ຊ່ວຍ.
I think Tom can't be that.
I've never been able to keep this away from you.
I think he's gonna keep me out of here.
I was so busy when Tom told me that he was not doing that.
I hope I'm going to see Tom tomorrow.
It's the only way to fill theสระว่ายน้ํา.

Tom told me he ບໍ່ ປະທັບ ໃຈ.
I'd like to have no idea what a person would like to be on his way.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom also ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ that.
Tom and Mary are about to be about to be a bar on the street.
Tom said he thought I might be able to do that too.
You know, it's not like that.
You know, it's gotta be done today, right?
I think Tom's about to start crying.
She'sพาเขาไป by theแขน.
Tom said he was intimidated.
It's worth the effort.
We don't have to wait for this.
I'm sorry that you'reลากing me into it.
Tom said he'd be thirsty.
Tom told me that Mary did that.
But I know that Tom's gonna be a little bitเจ็บ when he's trying to do that.
That's all we're gonna do?
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna be the court.
I think it's important.
What's Tom ໃສ່s a cape?

That's how people do it.
I'd like to be in Australia for a week.
I know Tom wants to know what to do.
I know that Tom is a little older than Mary.
No, it's going to be a solution.
Tom said that ແມ່ ຂອງ ລາວ ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ຮັກ ລາວ.
Tom should've been there for a long time.
Tom knows he's getting into the real hell out of here.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I don't want to say anything to Tom.
I don't think Tom knows what to do.
That's what you're talking about.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ໃນ ທີ່ ສຸດ ສິ່ງ ນີ້ ຈະ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ.
It's hard to remember what's going on.
Tom's never gonna hurt us.
Tom said that they know that Mary ອາດ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ by itself.

Tom thinks Mary's แฟนของจอห์น.
I'll take it.

The ตํารวจ believed that Tom and Mary were murdered.
It's a guarantee that it's important to use it.
Tom claims that they're ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ in 2013.
I think Tom's a little bit tough.
Tom is the one who's gonna say yes.
I hope Tom is still dead.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom, it's a tough example.

Tom would've done it without Mary's approval.
Tom thinks he's gonna be able to do that.
Tom asked Mary if ໂຢຮັນ had the same goals.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be gone.

I wish I could start crying.
Shouldn't you do it by yourself?
I don't think it's gonna be impossible.
I know Tom's a little bit of aว่ายน้ํา.
Tom's probably been told of the president.
I'd like to think that if we had the cheese left in the refrigerator,
What's wrong with you?

I know Tom's gonna do it from me in the afternoon.
- You're the one who can do this.
Let's see what you're going to say to me.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ເຫດຜົນ ທີ່ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄວນ ເຮັດ.
I think Tom's going to be a little late.
Tom used to know that he was supposed to do that, but he didn't want to.
Tom's a member of the body.
พ่อแม่ ບໍ່ ຍອມ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.

It's something that I'm trying to get out of here.
You're both Tom and Mary, you're gonna need to be?
I don't believe this is how you do it.
I think Tom might have done it.
I don't think it's worth the price you're paying for.
I think Tom's supposed to be home.

The joke's on us.
I am determined to เลิก สูบ.
I thought maybe I'd be able to get out of here.
Tom told me that he's not a snow.
Tom and Mary would never be able to do that for himself.
They will not be satisfied with what they are.
But I'm sure you're gonna do it.

It's embarrassing.
I don't think Tom would like to know why Mary was doing it tomorrow.
It's like a แปลก, isn't it?
I'd like to know that I'm working on an กฎหมาย.
คุณสัญญากับฉันว่าคุณจะทําอย่างนั้น?
Shouldn't we tell Tom that he's the type of guy who's supposed to win?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຕັມ ໃຈ ຊ່ວຍ.
There's a possibility that it's a real thing.
I know that I did the right thing.
Tom said they're going to despise Mary.
I've been thinking that Tom's in there.

I think Tom was trying to get in the way.

Tom said he'd try.

That's what Tom was wrong.

It's something to apologize to.
I'd rather beว่ายน้ํา.
I've been able to do that for months.

I thought it would be difficult to get aตั๋ว.
Tom said he'd do that, too.
I thought Tom was anโปรแกรมคอมพิวเตอร์.
Tom said he didn't know what to do.
I know that Tom's a better starter than Mary was.
Tom's going to be a part of Mary's.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that.
Tom said he'd know anything about the bank robbery.
You know, you know, I'm gonna hate you.
She's going to be fine in the โรง พยาบาล for a month.
Tom says he's seen Mary spanking one of those things.
That's what I'm supposed to do for a while.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Hello again.
The show's on November.
I'm on my way home.
I've been trying to find out what's going on.
ฉันไม่คิดว่ามีใครสงสัย ว่านายไม่ใช่ทอมจริงๆ
Go away and leave me alone!
Shouldn't you tell Tom that Mary is about to do that?
You know, it's gonna be okay to tell me that you want to be a good man.
Tom was just lazier than Mary.
That's what's going on.
I don't think they're gonna be able to stop Tom.
Tomไม่ได้คิดว่าเขามีโอกาสประสบความสําเร็จ แต่อย่างน้อยเขาต้องการที่จะยิงมัน
I'm guessing Tom left to Australia.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຈັບ ປ່ວຍ ຫນັກ.
ผมรู้ผมไม่ต้องทําอย่างนั้น แต่ผมดีใจที่ผมทํา
I don't think I can do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was ours.
Tom and Mary are taking off theช้อนs.
Do you have any idea what it is?
Tom said that he's going to hope that he's ພະຍາຍາມ ສຸດ ຄວາມ ສາມາດ ເພື່ອ win.
ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ໄດ້ ແນວ ໃດ ວ່າ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ?
Tom asked me to do it.
Tom said he didn't believe he told Mary that he'd do that.
Tom said he'd do that.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to the room to listen to the music.
I don't think it's a real thing.
I think it's okay.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ກໍາລັງ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
Tom should have known it.
I know that Tom wanted to know what would happen to him.
Tom told me he thought Mary could play a saxophone.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to ຮັກ two people ໃນ ເວລາ ດຽວ ກັນ.
Tom said he thought I was a สร้าง.
The Bible does not say anything about that.
I thought I was supposed to be able to do it.
I don't think it's gonna happen to you today.
I think it's good for Tom to do that.
Tom's gonna be fine with you.
Tom said Mary would do that.
Rape's got to be able to develop a celebrity post-traumatic all over the years of the day.
I thought Tom would be the one to do that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I know Tom'sช่วยชีวิต Mary.
I think Tom's the only one in the room.
I know Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ that.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ.
Tom told me that I'm ช้า.
I've done it every week since I've done it.
Tom told me he's been over 30.
Tom and Mary show me the letter he was told by John.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna do that.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary would not do that.
Tom was the one who told me that he should do that.
I'd like to know that no one would ever be able to do that.
I know Tom's going to be a better singer than I am.
Tom said he thought Mary might have been crying.
Tom thinks they're the only ones who're going to play the pipes.
Did you know Tom and Mary used to eat themselves?
Tom told me he thought Mary was out.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເມື່ອຍ.
Tom's been writing a lot of books.
Tom and Mary are both not happy to have a steak for dinner.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm sorry I made him nervous.
Tom says he's ວາງ ແຜນ to Australia for a year.
I've been thinking about what Tom's about to ซื้อ.
I think Tom wants to know that I'm เกลียดing them.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was cute.
I think Tom's ever done that.
Let's get us out of here!
Tom said he'd like to be in charge of the week.
Did he do this by the way?
Tom said they're starved.
Tom and Mary said that they would do it.
They're gonna keep an eye on the signs.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ຈະ ເກີດ ຫຍັງ ຂຶ້ນ.
I know Tom's going to be in ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary knows how to do it.
I'd like to know that Tom's gonna be ຫ່ວງed to something like that.
นี่เป็นครั้งแรกที่คุณให้เลือด?
Did you have aชา?
Tom was never gonna find Mary a job.
The bikes have a tyre.
I know Tom's been driving.
Good night!
It's gonna be okay.
Tom is ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ວ່າ ທຸກ ຄົນ ກຽດ ຊັງ ລາວ.
I know that Tom is gonna do that to me.
It's the first time you've been visiting Boston.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
I know I'm in love with you.
I thought she said it was not the perfect one.
He's done it.
Tom and Mary told me that they wereทุกข์ing.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຍອມ ແພ້ ຕໍ່ ມາ.
It was Tom who used to know where Mary was going.
Tom said Mary was going to a ออสเตรเลีย.
What do you want us to do for the fridge?
Tom told me he's out of it.
I know that Tom is the one who works for Mary.
I've read a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary wasสับสน.
They should have told Tom that he would do that.
I think Tom's gonna be safe here.
Tom thought Mary might be left to do that again.
ไม่มีใคร ຕອບ ຄໍາ ຖາມ ຂອງ ຂ້ອຍ.
Tom told me he's got to be determined to do that.
I think Tom can get home by myself.
Should we be at least thinking about it?
LENGLISH เป็นผู้พยากรณ์ของพระเจ้า.
He did it, as soon as he thought he would.
So I was wondering if Tom and Mary were going to be out.
I'm so busy with Tom, you know.
But if you've been able to find out what you're saying, I'm not going to be able to say it.
Tom said he ບໍ່ 'cause he's not gonna be able to hang out with Mary anymore.
Tom thought Mary might be able to do that anymore.
I don't know what to do. I'm trying to get Tom to do that.
He's so busy.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
What've you seen?
Tom told me he thought Mary ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
Tom said they thought it would be better to beออกไปข้างนอก.
This ອາດ ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ສໍາລັບ ເຈົ້າ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ຕາມ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຄໍາພີ ໄບ ເບິນ ບອກ ໄວ້.
เราอยู่ในเขตเดียวกัน.
I thought you both know Tom and Mary were allergic toถั่ว.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເປັນ ຜູ້ ຮັບ ໃຊ້ ຂອງ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ.
Tom and Mary said that he wasตกลง to do that.
It's a day to sleep!
This is a good time to get out of here.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ຕໍ່ ໆ ໄປ.
He can speak to a Russian, for example.
Tom said he didn't have that, so I've given it to him.
I'm ຢ້ານ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ມີ ຂ່າວ ດີ ອັນ ໃດ ແດ່ ສໍາລັບ ເຈົ້າ.
I know that Tom's not gonna be able to eat the ເຂົ້າ Mary's made of it.
Tom said he thought I was grateful.
I was wondering if Tom wasn't gonna be a big deal.
Tom's got to be reluctant to do that.
Tom's speech is like aน่าเบื่อ as Mary's.
Tom's a dead man, and it's not like he's been trying to find out what he's doing.
Tom knows that Mary's beenโกรธing.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ອີກ ຢ່າງ ຫນຶ່ງ.
Call me something else, I'm so late for dinner.
ເຮົາ ບໍ່ ເຫັນ's adversaries.
Tom said he'd rather ບໍ່ ໃຊ້ ເວລາ ຫຼາຍ ປີ ທີ່ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I think Tom's gonna be at the house of an American when he's visiting Boston.
I don't think Tom would be doing that anymore.
I know Tom's been trying to do that.
I don't think Tom's gonna be toบอสตัน for him.
I think Tom's innocence.
I think Tom was supposed to wait untilอย่างน้อย 2:30 before he left.
I thought Tom was going to be late for the day of hisประชุม.
Tom said that Mary was trying to understand how he was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
That's the most important thing to do.
I think Tom's gonna listen to me.
I'll have to pay for it.
Tom said they thought it could be inบอสตัน, too.
I'd like to have someone stops Tom.
I don't know if Tom and Mary were to do that, either.
I guess Tom and Mary are a lot.
The world is not as concerned as it is.
I think Tom's missing.
ฉันรู้คุณไม่อยากทําอย่างนั้น แต่คุณต้อง
Let's hope that's enough time.
Tom was one of thoseugliests who did.
I'm so glad I'm on my way.
I think the fact that we've been สงสัย that you were going to be Tom.
Let's put on a sculptureของคุณอย่างรวดเร็ว เราสาย.
Tom told me that he's a starved.
Tom told me that he knew how to speak to ฝรั่งเศส.
I'm sure Tom's right.
I thought I'd let that happen.
I thought it was aแปลก that Tom did not find Mary's party.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unbiased.
I don't think she's supposed to be in the middle of the night.
Tom said Mary might have been able to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might be allowed to do that anymore.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณรู้จักทอม.
ເຮົາ ຈະ ພິຈາລະນາ ບັນຫາ ນີ້ ຕໍ່ ໄປ.
I don't think Tom's got us to know.
Why not?
Tom thinks he's gonna be able to do whatever he ຕ້ອງການ.
I know what you're doing, but I think you're gonna do it.
I know Tom's gonna be able to do it tomorrow.
Tom told me that they thought Mary would be interested.
The Bible says: “The one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly
I'd be as if I had to, like, as Tom did.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ລາວ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ຕ່າງ ໆ ແບບ.
ຖ້າ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄປ ຂ້ອຍ ກໍ ຈະ ບໍ່.
- Are you up to a place where you live?
Tom and Mary say that they're too busy to be.
I know Tom wants to know that I'm supposed to do it.
Tom thinks Mary ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ມັກ of them.
Tom said he's got a lot of money.
Tom said he did that.
I think she's gonna be okay.
I know that Tom had to be willing to do that.
Tom told Mary that he's not just the one who taught me how to do it.
The คอมพิวเตอร์'s here to be done.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
She's got to be honest with me.
You're the one who used to be a liar.
Tom knew he was supposed to do that.
I think Tom's gonna be ตื่น too early in the morning.
I think Tom's gonna be stupid enough to do something like that.
I don't think Tom's going to be up to Australia.
I don't think Tom knows what he's supposed to be doing.
Both Tom and Mary can do that.
I thought she could.
Tom's poopy.
You know, it's gonna be like a real thing to do.
Tom said he'd be able to win.
Tom was trying to understand why he was following us.
What the hell do they mean?
I know I'm on my own.
ເປັນ ຫຍັງ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ເຮັດ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ບອກ ໃຫ້ ເຮັດ?
Tom ຕັດສິນ ໃຈที่ดีที่สุดคือ ปล่อย Mary to ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom can't do that if Mary asked us to ບໍ່.
I thought he said he wanted to know what's going on.
It's hard to do that until Tom said it would be.
I don't think Tom's gonna be going to ออสเตรเลีย with Mary.
I'mเหนื่อยing.
I'm 18 years old.
He's not going to be here.
Tom may have used to think about how he works.
Let's hope you're ປິ່ນປົວ.
I know that you are the only one who can do this.
I'll say French, you're not gonna be able to do it.
Shouldn't you listen to Tom for a while?
Tom said I should let you drive.
What's wrong?
What's Tom ໃສ່ing theหมวกs?
Tom says he ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ໃສ່ ໃສ່ ເຄື່ອງ เสื้อเก่าของจอห์น.
I think we can do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was doing that.
Theนาฬิกา's beenหยุด.
Tom, I'm both kind of in Boston.
Tom said he was an artist.
I don't think Tom's gonna be talking to you.
I think he's got enough money.
Shouldn't you hear me?
I'm going to give you ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງການ.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมกําลังคาดหวัง Mary to do that to them.
I know Tom's anนักเขียน.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ກິນ ຫມາກ.
Tom said he wanted to do it.
I thought we were gonna be able to do this.
I think it's a good chance to know if it's gonna rainคืนนี้.
ผมรักคุณและผมจะทําเสมอ
Yes.
I know Tom's not going to be a bad one.
I think I'm the one who's the only one who's ever done.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຕັມ ໃຈ ຊ່ວຍ ເຮົາ.
It's open to the interrogation.
Tom said that he's done.
I know it's gonna be hard to do.
What's the matter with you?
It's up to me.
I'm a bit out of shape!
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่าทอมกําลังเจอคนอื่น?
It's gonna be hard for us to find someone to replace Tom.
ຂ້ອຍ ຄວນ ລະວັງ ຫຼາຍ ຂຶ້ນ.
Tom and Mary realized that they wereน่ารักing.
I thought we had an idea that if we were going to make it, we would be able to do it.
I'd never say that I ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ฝรั่งเศส.
Tom's just as easy as Mary.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງການ ເພາະ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ບອກ ນັ້ນ.
I thought Tom was going to be out of the world.
Tom told me that she had no idea where Mary was going to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be embarrassed.
ฉันหวังว่าฉันจะมีโอกาสไปบอสตัน.
I'm just glad we're back.
Tom says he's not gonna be able to trust Mary, but he's not gonna be able to give up.
I think it's a good idea.
Tom will protect himself.
Do what Tom told me to do.
วันเสาร์ is the first day of the week.
I knew that Tom would always know how to do that.
Tom told me that they thought Mary was going to be crampy.
I know, Tom, what's the only way he's been able to do it on Monday.
Who's the "ser"?
But I've promised you that I'm gonna keep going.
Tom said that they know that Mary ອາດ ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ອີກ.
Tom thinks he's gonna put some umbrella on theรถไฟ.
I'm upr than Tom.
I know that Tom's gonna be aฝรั่งเศส. I'm สงสัย if Mary can, too.
I know Tom's gonna be quick to do that than Mary.
There's a celibacy out of here.
Hello, คุณชื่ออะไร?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ບໍ່ ມາ ຢູ່ ນີ້ พรุ่งนี้.
Tom says he's got a lot of fun inบอสตัน.
So I'm assuming it's by the fact that Tom's a little bit.
I've always been สงสัย that Tom was a little ravenous.
I know that Tom is the only one who knows what I'm about to do.
Shouldn't you be able to do it again?
ເຮົາ ເຮັດ ວຽກ ທຸກ ມື້ ແຕ່ Monday.
I know that you're the one who does that.
Tom said he wanted to stop it.
I know that Tom ແລະ Mary is a ແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
I should've been doing it yesterday.
It's hard.
That's why Tom was going to ออสเตรเลีย.
I thought she was ຕື່ນ ເຕັ້ນ ແທ້ ໆ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ກໍາລັງ ແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
Tom told me he might be crying.
I thought he'd never find the other ones.
I'm the only one who used to know that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I thought it would be hard to believe that Tom did it on purpose.
I thought we could be ຫຍຸ້ງ at the wrong time.
Tom said he thought he was supposed to do it by himself.
I don't think it's an exception.
ฉันรู้คุณไม่ชอบฉันมาก
I think it's announcing to do what it's like to be taught by Jehovah.
Tomมีหลายอย่างที่เขาต้องการทําวันนี้.
Tom said something else ຄືນ about that.
Tom's been thinking about how he's got to be.
I know I'm supposed to do that.
Tom said he's not gonna get toบอสตัน any longer.
I'm guessing Tom's gonna be on his way.
Dogs, who's dead, can't beกัด.
I don't think Tom's going to be as crazy as the ບາງ ຄົນ ຄິດ.
I don't think I'll do it myself.
Tom ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຮົາ ຈະ ຊອກ ຫາ ໃຜ ຈັກ ຄົນ ທີ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້ ສໍາລັບ ເຮົາ.
She's avoiding them.
Tom, it's not as simple as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do this by myself.
Tom said Mary would have had to do that.
I think Tom's got to be wrong.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ລາວ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເປັນ ຄື ກັບ.
Tom was the reason Mary moved toบอสตัน.
I should have known myself.
Tom said Mary was looking forward to being retired.
I can't tell you that when you're moved toบอสตัน.
I've been in love with someone.
It's the first time Tom ever cried out about that.
Tom was missing by the man.
I think we're gonna be crazy.
He's got a friend.
I think Tom's gonna ຂໍ ໃຫ້ ເຈົ້າ ແຕ່ງ ດອງ him.
Tom said that Mary thought John was too allowed to do that for himself.
I don't want Tom to do that.
Tom said he wanted to be so อนุญาต to do that.
I'm guessing Tom's getting involved.
What's wrong withkilos?
Both Tom and Mary are okay.
I'm a despicable human beings.
I'll never forget the day when you and I will be here for you to join me.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ແຕ່ ຄົນ ດຽວ ທີ່ ວາງ ແຜນ ຈະ ຢູ່ ນໍາ ເຮົາ คืนนี้.
Tom and Mary are both ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ to be free.
Tom told me that they're นอนy.
Mary's been trying to find a body of hers.
Tom thought he wasขโมยจักรยาน Mary's.
I'm puffing off the flag.
Tom said Mary was probably supposed to be ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom said they ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that.
I'm three years older than I am.
When is this birthday?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຈັບ ປວດ.
This is a good idea.
I'm not gonna be able to see you.
ผมไม่ทราบว่าทอมและ Mary ແຕ່ງ ດອງไปแล้ว
I've been trying to kill people.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom and Mary said he would like to.
I'm getting it.
I thought she said she was สนุกing doing that.
Where do you understand how to do that?
I'd like to have Tom and Mary ຮູ້ຈັກ ຮູ້ຈັກ ຮູ້ຈັກ on aบอสตัน.
I've been on an อาหาร for more than a year.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ເຕັມ ໃຈ ຊ່ວຍ ເຮົາ ໃຫ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
Tom thinks Mary's got a driver's license.
I know Tom's a little bit of aggressor.
Tom ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ he's never gonna be able to buy anything.
Tom said Mary was supposed to do that.
I'd like to know how much you're going to do.
Tom says they're not buying a อากาศวานe.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่า Tom was แคนาดา?
Come on, guys.
I'm guessing Tom's going to be home, หลับ.
Tom and Mary tell me that you're not doing that again.
Tom, throw up.
Tom ບໍ່ ມັກ of the สี.
Tom's got to get your hands on the head.
I'm a farmer.
It's gonna be okay to be ແຕ່ງ ດອງ by Tom.
I don't know what to do.
Tom and Mary said he wanted to know.
Tom wants to be inบอสตัน as long as he does not.
Tom said he's a Canada.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
So I guess Tom was supposed to be ແຕ່ງ ດອງ by Mary.
Tom said that he's the only one who knows what to do.
I was wondering if Tom and Mary were doing it yesterday.
I think Tom might be doing that as a result of the day.
Did you let ລູກ of this happen to you on the street?
I don't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom loves to believe that Mary can do that.
There's a cat under theโต๊ะ.
I think Tom's the one who needs to know.
I don't think Tom knows when it's gone.
Is it really Tom's about to be moved to Boston?
Tom said they ບໍ່ ຢາກ ຢູ່ ປະເທດ ออสเตรเลีย anymore.
I thought she looked ເມື່ອຍ.
Tom said I looked up to it.
I think Tom's gonna make Mary do that.
I'm very interested in a หมากรุก.
I don't think I'd be walking in a ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom said Mary was supposed to do it by himself.
พ่อแม่ฉันตาย ตอนฉันอายุ 3 ขวบ.
I think Tom's been in the wrong place.
ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເຈົ້າ ກໍາລັງ ເວົ້າ ເຖິງ ແມ່ນ ຫຍັງ?
He's going to be.
I know, I'm gonna need to talk to Tom tomorrow.
I think Tom's got a แฟน.
Tom said Mary's tooกระหาย.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ມັກ ທີ່ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I'm peeling apples.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ສຶກສາ ฝรั่งเศส.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ຄື ກັບ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ.
Tom told me that he's the one who's supposed to be able to do what he's supposed to do.
Tom told me that I should say yes.
Tom ບໍ່ press the button.
There's something left in the fridge.
Tom said that they know that Mary ອາດ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I know Tom's not gonna be able to do that.
Tom said he'd like to know that Mary's gonna be able to answer ฝรั่งเศส.
I don't think it's what I'm going to do with it on time.
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be ยุ่งing พรุ่งนี้.
Tom said they're trying to understand why they're gonna do that.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຢາກ Mary to do that.
Tom said he'd like to be in charge of coming in.
I don't think Tom's the one who doesn't know what to do.
Tom told me that they'd never be able to ซื้อ ສິ່ງ ຈໍາເປັນ ສໍາລັບ three hundred dollars.
ทุกคนรักสิ่งฟรี.
I don't think it's funny.
If Tom did, I would, too.
I know Tom's gonna be in the middle of the night.
Tom and Mary said they're เตรียม to know that.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ແມ່ນ ຄົນ ທີ່ ບອກ ວ່າ Mary was supposed to do that.
I thought he said he could not do that.
Tom said they were wondering if Mary was not doing it or not.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ວາງ ແຜນ ຈະ ໄປ.
Tom's a little girl.
Tom and Mary said that he ບໍ່ ຄາດ ຫມາຍ ແທ້ ໆ ວ່າ ມີ ໃຜ ເພື່ອ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said it was Mary who told us that they should do that.
Tom ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary was the only way to get out of here.
I don't think I'm gonna hold it up for any time.
Tom wants to be as tall as Mary.
Tom said he wanted to think of Mary's heat.
I know you're a little bit of a lot of money.
You'reโกหก!
I told Tom that I found it.
I think Tom's about to talk to Mary.
I've promised Tom I'm not going to talk to him.
ເຊື່ອ ວ່າ ທຸກ ຄົນ ສົມຄວນ ໄດ້ ຮັບ.
Tom told me that he might be able to get ณ the ประชุม.
Tom wanted to know what to do.
The fact that she was in the wrong place is, and she had no idea how much she wanted to do it.
Tom said he knew that Mary was the one who did.
I thought Tom and Mary were gonna kill จอห์น.
Give me a light on, please.
Tom said ออสเตรเลีย was a better house to visit.
I thought Tom was on the ຫຍຸ້ງຍາກ.
I've been listening to him.
It's done.
Tom's words were so long for three hours.
I thought Tom was right.
Maybe I'll be able to make sure I'm in the middle of a quart of Tom.
Tom's just gonna stay away.
I don't think we're gonna be able to see the films more than once.
I don't think so.
Tom ຕ້ອງ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ບາງ ຄົນ ສົນ ໃຈ.
I think Tom's gonna be in Australia for a long time.
Tom told Mary he'd never be back here.
I don't know what to do.
I'm guessing Tom will never be able to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's ต้องการซื้อ.
He's gonna stop me.
I think Tom's not gonna be the best.
I think it's gonna be fun to make it to us to live by ออสเตรเลีย a year or two.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมน่าจะทําแบบนั้นมากกว่าที่เขาเคยเป็นเมื่อวาน
I think Tom's doing something he's gonna do.
The road is so cool when it's rained.
I'm still going to be ຫຍຸ້ງ in the afternoon.
I think it's gonna be a lot of money.
Tom said he thought he was able to do that on the 20th.
Tom and Mary said he wanted to know where John was planning to do that.
I know that Tom might be left to do that again.
Tom gave me the piece ofเค้ก.
I know Tom's aggressman.
เรารู้ว่าคุณทํางานให้พวกเขา
ทุกคนที่นี่ ยกเว้น Tom has done that.
I think I should do this myself.
But I think that a man has something to do with Tom.
Tom knows he's been doing it all night.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would do that by itself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was going to be a favor.
I thought it was safe to take care of him.
Tom said he'd let them do that.
I'm an มหาวิทยาลัย.
I think Tom ບໍ່ did it, but I'm gonna be fine.
You're the one who's gone?
Tom and I are both loyal.
I think I've made enough spaghetti for myself.
I know Tom's the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she's gonna do that.
I don't think it's gonna be a good idea to do it on my own.
Are you saying that you don't want to do it?
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that.
ผมรับรองได้ ว่ามันจะไม่เกิดขึ้น
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to the head.
Tom said he'd put a book to Mary.
It can be hard for you to bear.
I think Tom might be able to understand why it is important to do it.
I know Tom's a freaky boy.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ມີ ເຫດຜົນ ທີ່ ຈະ ຢູ່.
Tom and Mary know that they're ສ່ວນ to blame.
I'm just trying to find out what Tom's been planning on doing.
Hardly, people can't expect Tom to win.
Don't you want to ask me a word!
I think Tom thinks it's hard to think about it.
Tom and Mary will be รอ to the apostle Paul.
What's the point?
Tom knows he's going to ວາງໃຈ me.
Tom told Mary that he's got to be in the world for a long time.
I hear you've been voting.
Tom, you can't do that.
I don't think Tom doesn't even do that.
Tom's about to be open.
It ບໍ່ ມີ ເຫດຜົນ.
Tom told me he thought Mary was beingหย่าd.
Tom told me that they were the ones who were.
Tom said that Mary was trying to do that by myself.
Tom said he'd be fine with the French.
It is not salt.
Have we seen Tom?
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
สุนัขs look up in the area where I do.
ພະອົງ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ສັ່ງ ໃຫ້ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຮັດ ຕາມ ຄໍາ ສັ່ງ ທີ່ ຢູ່ ໃນ ຄໍາພີ ໄບ ເບິນ.
I know it's true.
Tom said they're gonna do that.
I'm สงสัย Tom and Mary are not doing it as soon as possible.
I know Tom's gonna be able to talk to him about it.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary are not allowed to make it tomorrow.
But I know that you're willing to deal with it.
Tom and Mary said that they're working on self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary was careful.
Tom's been used to the living room, sofa.
I've been looking for both Tom and Mary, just like aนิยาย.
Tom knew I was doing it yesterday.
I've been thinking about Tom and Mary as well as I've been doing this before.
Tom said that he was prepared to do that.
You're going to have a picnic if it's okay tomorrow.
สัญญา me how much you want to tell us.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said he's working out.
I think Tom might be able to do that.
Tom did it when he could.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said that the rest of the house is equal to the sales.
I'm getting used to it.
I think I can do that.
I think we all have to do whatever we want.
I think Tom and Mary were in Boston at least one time.
ฉันไม่คิดว่าฉันรู้จักใครที่นี่
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຢາກชนะ.
Tom knows that Mary's a สอน.
Tom told Mary that she's supposed to quit pretending to be a good man.
Can we please just leave?
I know that Tom is about to be one of the young ones he is.
I know Tom's going to be a good man.
Tom thinks I'd be left to do it myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know, Tom's gonna be cool.
I think Tom's gonna be lonely.
I don't think it's like Tom doesn't even know what he's doing.
I'm so busy that Tom ไม่ได้อยู่ที่นี่ yesterday.
Mary's got to take care of her to theแบน ใหม่.
Tom and Mary said that they're talking to ฝรั่งเศส a week ago.
I don't think you can tell Tom how to do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາບານ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
He's walking right there, ຕົກໃຈ.
I'll be glad to hear what I'm supposed to say to you.
Tom told me that he'd be the one to meet.
I'm sorry to be careful as I'm supposed to be.
Tom, you don't think it's okay.
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself.
I think Tom needs to be like one of them.
Tom said he heard the noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is going to be.
I know I've done the same thing.
You're so ແປກ ໃຈ ທີ່ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ, aren't you?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຢາກ ຟັງ ว่า พวก เขา บิน ได้.
What a sunshine!
I've seen Mt Fuji.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ theสะพาน wasปิด.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I thought Tom would've been พบ Mary by now.
Tom said he'd like to know if Mary did.
We're supposed to assume that Tom is a guilty man.
Watch yourself.
Mary said that she ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ວາງ ແຜນ to do that.
They're gonna keep telling Tom how to do it.
I thought Tom did it when he was 13 years old.
Tom said he thought he could win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said that I was the only one who had been listening to him.
Enough!
I thought Tom knew I was going to do that.
Did you know Tom did that?
I guess it's just that it's just as if he did it.
Both Tom and Mary were born toบอสตัน when they were ລູກ.
This is the only way to do this is to make sure that it is necessary for you to share your faith with others.
That's probably against me.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ told me that they're going to need a lot of weight.
The house is not a big deal.
I'mค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่า Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่าฉันยังวางแผนที่จะเข้าร่วมทีม?
Theห้องน้ํา ບໍ່ สะอาด.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said that they were safe.
Tom said he thought he'd never be able to convince Mary to go out with them.
Tom thought Mary was the first one to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a bit more serious.
It's one of the things I've done to you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough toสนุกกับ ดนตรีแบบนี้.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ.
ยกเว้น Tom, that's what he did.
She's been ป่วย for three weeks.
Tom says he's not able to say ฝรั่งเศส anything else.
It's a big deal.
Tom's got a อธิษฐาน.
Tom said he thought he could take care of himself.
I'm the one who said Tom was the one who took the lead.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I've left the umbrella in the sub-section.
It's been a bad thing.
I'm guessing Tom's gonna be interested in doing that.
I promised Tom that I would do that.
I thought Tom would never take care of it.
It's not the only one who's ever been able to do it.
Tom said it's gonna be fun.
Tom, it's hard to ເຊື່ອ ຟັງ.
Coopttes are green.
I've never been taught by Mary.
I don't think I'm gonna be alone with you.
Tom knows I'm gonna be gone early.
Tom Tossssed theหมาs of the world.
เรื่อง นี้ เกี่ยว ข้อง กับ เรา อย่าง ไร?
Why do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom wanted to know that I was supposed to do that.
That's just ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເປັນ ໄປ ໄດ້.
It's just that they're gonna do something.
ผมค่อนข้างมั่นใจว่าผมทําได้
Tom said that they and Mary were gonna be alive in the day of Christmas.
What's going on in the entrance of the entrance?
Tom did not find it hard to be okay.
Tom told me that they're gonna be out of here.
Tom said that they ບໍ່ ພິສູດ Mary do that.
Tom and Mary told me that they were getting bored.
Tom said he's not gonna be late.
Tom thinks Mary's on the inside.
I know it's not enough to be able to get some food to the picnic.
What's wrong with you?
I'm guessing Tom is a reluctant to do that.
Tom was never likes to be a man.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said he'd rather be able to speak to us for a week.
To what end?
Tom said he thought that Mary was an assurd by what was going on.
He did this. He did so.
He's got to take care of it.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຈົ້າ ເປັນ ຄົນ ທີ່ ຕ້ອງການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສັນຍາ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ບໍ່ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I thought Tom would do that.
We've been working for the last year.
Can we take a picture of me?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
It would be wise to do that.
Tom told me that they ບໍ່ ມີปัญหาเรื่องนั้น.
Tom said that Mary's supposed to be here by himself.
Tom's got to be in love.
For a long time, it's been a long time since it's gone.
- Thank you. - Thank you. - No, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom said he was fired.
คุณคิดว่าเราควรไปที่ที่ Tom ต้องการให้เราไป ແທນ ທີ່ ຈະ ມາที่นี่?
He's got a big หู.
I don't think Tom's not doing that by myself.
I'm just trying to keep it from Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told us that they were not doing that.
Tom was the one who was in the middle of the prison, ໂດຍ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງ Preparole.
So I'm assuming that theปืน I heard was the one that killed Tom.
It's just that it's all right.
Tom told me he thought Mary was too high.
I know Tom's a millionaire.
Tom said he thought that it would be safe.
I don't think I'll allow Tom to do that.
No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry I did that.
I think Tom's not eating meat.
หวังว่าเราคงไม่มีปัญหากับทอม
That's what I'm saying.
It's the first time Tom ever cried out about the noise.
I'll never tell you anything.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Mary was a แคนาดา.
I think Tom's a chaufficin.
Tom and Mary say that ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ຊ່ວຍ ເຮົາ ໄດ້.
I don't think it's analogy for you to do it.
Tom says he's probably the only one who knows where Mary is.
But I know that you're gonna like Tom to do that to you.
I thought Tom was ทิ้ง to Mary a month ago.
I think Tom's not gonna be one to do that.
Tom's gonna do one of the things he did.
I don't think Tom's going down.
I don't know what to do with Tom, but I don't know what to do.
Tom said Mary thought he might be allowed to do that.
I knew that it ອາດ ເບິ່ງ ບໍ່ ສໍາຄັນ ຫຼາຍ.
He said that ยา wants to be safe.
I know it doesn't seem like we're gonna have to keep up with you.
I think Tom's going to call him.
I'd like to know that you're a superstitious person.
Tom said they thought it would be a mistake to ບອກ Mary ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ໄດ້ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ.
Tom thinks Mary may be able to say it.
It's done enough to decreas the guy.
That's never gonna happen if you're done when I told you to do it.
I thought Tom was not going to come to Boston with me.
I don't do it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
มีใครมี kleenex?
Tom told me that he thought he was going to be aดังer.
เราได้ทําไปแล้ว
Tom's a Hemophiliac.
I'd like to say something.
Tom said they're not willing to talk about anything else.
Tom said that he knew how to do that.
Tom, I'm both right.
I'm guessing you're going to have to drink too much.
I was wondering if Tom and Mary would do that.
What's your mother's name?
I think Tom was supposed to be the one who's supposed to be speaking.
Sami knows what I'm saying.
ฉันไม่แน่ใจว่า ฉัน ພ້ອມ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນີ້.
Tom said that I'm gonna be able to ສຶກສາ ฝรั่งเศส.
What's wrong with you?
We've got a big head.
He's not going to sleep.
I've never beenจ้าง by Tom.
Tom, you know, did you do that?
Tom's been eating more than I've been.
Well, it's been a mistake.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ໃຜ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said Mary was probably probably willing to do that.
มีใครไปออสเตรเลีย?
Tom said he didn't think I was doing that.
Tom says that they ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ສະແດງ ໃຫ້ ເຫັນ ວ່າ ເພື່ອ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
It's just that it's gonna be enough to have a good time for him.
Tom said I should be in the middle of the night.
I knew that Tom would never be able to do that.
Tom said I should go homeเร็วๆ นี้.
Tom and Mary are going to be in the middle of the night when they are careful.
Tom's gonna do that.
ผมไม่ทราบว่า Tom told Mary that he's gonna do that.
I'm not going to visitบอสตัน again.
And by the time we ສອນ and ສຶກສາ, it's time for us to get to know Jehovah.
I think Tom is conceited.
I don't think Tom doesn't even know if he did.
I know that Tom wants to know that Mary's not gonna be able to do it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຊົາ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom's incompetent.
Tom thinks Mary's wearing a drink, like a ปลา.
I know what I want to do, but I'm glad that I did.
Tom said he thought that he would never be able to live with Mary.
Tom and Mary said he told me.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมเป็นนักกอล์ฟ บางทีเขาอาจจะสอนคุณให้เล่น
นึกว่าคุณรู้จักทอม ແລະ ມາລີ ແຕ່ງ ດອງกัน
I knew that Tom would be able to do that because he had no faith in God.
I suppose you're not going to be a member of the Governing Body.
What's the point of doing so?
I think Tom understood everything.
I know that you are willing to do what is right.
Tom's downstairs.
I know, Tom's gonna be in touch.
It's not a business.
Mary's got a series of postcards.
I know Tom would be able to get a lot of money.
Tom said he's ເຕັມ ໃຈ ຊ່ວຍ.
I'm guessing you're not gonna call Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary goes back toบอสตัน.
I was wondering if Tom wasจูบd by Mary tonight.
I don't think that's what we're looking for.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ทอม ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເປັນ ນັກ ສຶກສາ ທີ່ ບໍ່ ດີ.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that.
It's hard to นม แพะ?
Do you think he's gonna find a way to theแคมป์site?
Tom wanted to know if I had threeแมวs.
I should've been out of here while I was on my way.
What's wrong with us?
I thought I told you to get the door off.
The grandmother's texting is faster than he is.
You're both Tom and Mary in Boston?
Let's hit theความชัน!
What's wrong with you?
Tom knows they're making the ເລືອກ ເລືອກ.
I thought she said she'd do that to Tom.
Well, I think that's what they say.
So I thought I could tell Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interesting.
What's wrong with you?
Get out of here.
I know it's hard.
I've been thinking about Tom and Mary, who'd probably be too busy to do that.
I thought she might beหิว.
But I thought Tom told me I was going to go on.
You know, Tom's gonna be staying in Australia for a week?
Tom said he wanted to know what Mary was going to be with us.
ເຈົ້າ ຍັງ ບໍ່ ຢ້ານ, right?
I thought she would say that.
มูลค่าของสุขภาพ ไม่สามารถประเมินค่าได้
It is because of that.
I don't think Tom knows what it's gonna be.
Tom said they're ສຸຂະພາບ.
I know Tom's gonna be fine.
Tom already knows Mary's about to do that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Give it up!
Tom said he'd be able to do that again.
Tom was supposed to show him how to do it.
Tom said he and Mary left early ເພາະ Mary was ຮູ້ສຶກ.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຄິດ Mary should do that.
Tom told me he thought that Mary was uninvolved.
Put theกางเกง on.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ພ້ອມ ທີ່ ຈະ ເວົ້າ.
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to be doing that.
I've been saying that I've been circumstanced to Tom ตั้งแต่ครั้งแรกที่ I met him.
What's wrong with the Africans?
Where did you put the โทรทัศน์?
Tom said Mary was probably not comfortable.
It is true that the earth isรอบ.
Tom, you can't be honest.
Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ ໃຫ້ ຜູ້ ຄົນ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ລາວ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເວົ້າ French.
Look at the girl.
Tom told Mary that she's supposed to be quitting him to be accuped.
I told Tom that you're not going to be in ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom thinks it's a mistake.
I know Tom's a very simple man.
Tom thought Mary was downstairs.
I don't think I'm gonna do it.
Tom said he was ພ້ອມ to do what was จําเป็น.
Tom says he'sเป็นหนี้ing Mary in a lot.
Tom said he thought I was สร้าง.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to eat dinner with you.
It's not safe to be late for me.
You know, you know, Tom's got this whole thing?
Tom knows that Mary's not a stan.
Tom and Mary said that they wanted to win.
Tom told me that they've been told.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows that if he's the only one to do this, he's gonna be able to do it.
Tom and Mary said that they're hard to win.
He said he's gone.
I've been ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ to do that again.
I'd like to know that you were dating Tom.
I think Tom might have been able to ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ.
I know you're not going to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary that they ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
All right, guys!
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ว่า เขาไม่ควรทําแบบนั้นวันนี้
Tom and Mary say that he ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
Toms, hopes that they're not gonna be able to make their lives to ออสเตรเลีย for more than a year.
What do you want to say?
Tom said Mary knew that he was ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing it until วันจันทร์.
I know what Tom's house's got to do with the sales.
I don't think Tom's sad.
I think Tom's gonna win.
I don't think I'm gonna do it by myself.
I want to know how much I want to do to you.
Tom said that ທຸກ ຄົນ he ຕັ້ງ ໃຈ ແນ່ວ ແນ່ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
Tom told me he thought Mary was strict.
Tom said he thought Mary might do that by herself.
ເຮົາ ຕ້ອງການ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ຫຼາຍ ຂຶ້ນ ເພື່ອ ຊ່ວຍ.
Tom said he thought it was gonna snow tonight.
I've promised Tom I'm going to be home early.
Tom said they're gonna look at it.
Tom said that it was hard for him to think it would be.
You're not gonna be able to help.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ ແທ້ ໆ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ.
Tom's speech is not as long as Mary's.
ผมไม่ทราบว่าทอมจะ ເຕັມ ໃຈ ທີ່ ຈະ ສະແດງ ໃຫ້ ເຫັນ ວິທີ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ປະຕິບັດ ຕໍ່ ຄົນ ອື່ນ ແນວ ໃດ?
I'm sorry I hurt you.
ທຸກ ໆ ຄົນ ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຢ້ານ ແຕ່ ເຈົ້າ ກໍ ຍັງ ຮັກສາ ຄວາມ ສັດ ຊື່ ຕໍ່ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ ໄວ້ ໄດ້.
ทอม ຢ້ານ ວ່າ ພໍ່ ແມ່ ຈະ ເລີ່ມ ຖາມ ລາວ ແລະ ເພິ່ນ ຈະ ບອກ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ກ່ຽວ ກັບ ທຸກ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ລາວ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ.
Did you read the book yesterday in ฝรั่งเศส?
I'm a dorcel.
Tom wants to know that I'm in the ออสเตรเลีย.
You could've gone.
Tom said he'd like to see the smell of Mary.
He's still in love with me.
But I thought you were a game of binomic better than you.
I'm glad to see that Tom's going to be very happy again.
I thought Tom was out of here.
I know that Tom can be fundled with Mary to do that.
I think we're going to have a good time.
Tom said they're trying to ซ่อน Mary.
I think Tom's gonna do it for me.
Tom's the one who's ever been on the street.
I'm sure Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ ແທ້ ໆ to do that.
Tom said he thought that Mary might be able to do that week.
I know that Tom is the one who said he's got to do it.
To tell the truth, I'm not going to be any of you.
I think Tom's gonna do it by Mary.
That's why Tom's running home, isn't it?
I thought she'd be here for Mary.
Tom said he had hoped that Mary was trying to do that.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't think Tom's got to do that by the way.
Tom said he'd know Mary's gonna be able to speak French.
Tom told me where he's going to be aบอสตัน.
Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ມາ ນີ້ เขาอาจโทรมา
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ມ່ວນ ຫຼາຍ ກັບ ການ ຫຍຸ້ງຍາກ.
I know Tom's late.
Tom told me he was going to be home.
Tom told me that they had gone through a book.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
ใช่แล้ว!
I think I'm gonna be able to do that.
I'm just saying that Tom wants to have a brother.
I think Tom's the one who's not doing that.
So I guess it's gonna be impossible.
So I thought, if Tom and Mary were telling the truth,
What's the matter with you?
It's not gonna be too late for the shipping.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ອາດ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເປັນ ຜູ້ ຮັບ ໃຊ້ ຂອງ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ.
Tom said he thought Mary was a cook.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຍັງ ບໍ່ ຍອມ ຮັບ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
ทุกคน, except Tom, who knows that they ບໍ່'re supposed to be to be toบอสตัน.
I know that Tom was the only one who knew what Mary was doing yesterday.
I know that Tom is the only one who's going to be a good man.
But if I've spoken French better, then I'll do the job.
What's wrong with you?
Tom and Mary said he'd be able to do that.
เต่าเหล่านี้ไม่ได้เป็นต้นตอของแคลิฟอร์เนีย.
Tom told me that he thought Mary ບໍ່ ຢາກ ໄປบอสตัน.
He said he was แคนาดา.
But it was not easy for him to accept the Bible’s message.
I know Tom's a prisoner.
Tom's ຫວັງ Marys was trying to find out what John was ຖາມ to do.
Tom said he had hoped that he'd be able to ซื้อ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ລາວ ຈໍາເປັນ by $300.
Tom said that Mary thought she was the only one who had to do that.
Both Tom and Mary are สมทบing a กองทัพ when they are eighteen.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Tom was the one who used to be a disciple of Mary.
Ya hafta smells roses.
Tom said he'd like to be like the สุนัข.
Tom told me he thought he was gonna win tomorrow.
It's a lot of fun to be.
Tom thought Mary's ชุด was kind of ເຫມາະ ສົມ by the way.
What are you doing here?
Tom said he's just glad he did it.
I thought Tom was doing it.
I don't think they're gonna do it.
Did you know that Tom and Mary might have had to do that?
Tom told me he thought Mary was almost ready to drive.
I'll be right there.
I don't think Tom's nosy.
I'd never do that.
I believe that the only way to make it is to do it.
Tom's gonna be quick to do that than Mary, even if he's not gonna be too difficult.
I know that Tom told Mary that he's not gonna do that.
ในความเห็นของฉัน, คุณผิด.
Tom told me he thought Mary was cute.
I don't think I'm going to be out of here this time, because it's gonna be cold.
Tom made it clear that he ບໍ່ ຢາກ Mary to the party.
Tom and Mary said that they ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing this.
Tom said he didn't think he'd be willing to buy Mary a birthday.
I thought Tom would be able to play pokers with him.
I don't think anyone can do that.
I thought he'd been out of control.
I know Tom's aฉลาดer than I am.
Tom said he wanted to be Mary to do that.
I don't think Tom's gonna be interested in going toบอสตัน for him.
Tom said he thought Mary was a cook.
Tom, it's not like that.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่ใช่ครูประวัติศาสตร์ ผมคิดว่าเขาเป็นครูวิทยาศาสตร์
Who's Tom?
Tom assumed that he'd always know what to do.
We're in the middle of the night.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมจะไม่บอก Mary how they're gonna do that.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ແມ່ນ ຄົນ ທີ່ ບອກ ວ່າ Mary ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
Tom wants to know about the plan.
Tom told me he's got something to take care of.
I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.
Tom said he knew that Mary was not doing that.
Tom told me he'd be ຫຍຸ້ງ on Monday.
I don't want to focus on the boy.
I know that I'm going to be in prison.
That's just it!
I think you can do this by yourself.
Did you know Tom would be able to win?
Tom said he thought Mary was in danger.
Well, I think we're gonna do it.
ເຮົາ ຈະ ຮູ້ ໄດ້ ແນວ ໃດ ວ່າ ທ່ານ ທັງ ຫຼາຍ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ โกหก ເຮົາ?
But I thought that you'd ທັງ ຫມົດ hold me, Tom was one of the newนักร้องs.
Tom wants to know that Mary's in pain.
I'm going to go to Boston if I can.
Are you planning to take a picture, right?
I don't think Tom knows what he's done to ซื้อ.
He is “the God of all comfort. ”
Tom said he knew Mary was having a good time inบอสตัน.
The rest of the world’s lives are in danger of becoming a part of the world.
It's been a while.
I thought it would be hard to do that.
So I'm guessing Tom ບໍ່ was willing to do that.
I'm ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ຫຍັງ ຜິດ.
I know Tom's not gonna be able to do that anymore.
Tom said Mary was happy that he ບໍ່ ໄດ້.
คุณไม่ใช่ผู้หญิงในเมือง, huh?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຢູ່ ຫັ້ນ.
สวรรค์ know that he's been doing this after all.
I think Tom's not gonna see it.
What's the matter with you, Tom?
It's okay.
Shouldn't you look at Tom'sใบหน้า when I tell them about what Mary did?
Tomไม่สามารถออกจากถุงเท้าของเขา.
I don't think Tom can win.
I think Tom ບໍ່ ເຫັນ me yesterday.
Why do you want me to think that I'mโกหก?
A is a หนัก on its own turf.
Tom's got the fact that he's going to be going to make it.
I'll make you a sandwich if you're not one.
It would be better if he were to be gone.
Tom said he's not gonna be able to do that.
คุณจะไม่ยอมแพ้ใช่ไหม?
Tom said he'd never come home this morning.
ຄົນ ສ່ວນ ຫຼາຍ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າมากกว่าค่าเฉลี่ย.
Tom told me he thought Mary was tickleish.
Tom told me he thought Mary was going to be gone by the time he was going to make it.
He's been in the United States last year to brush up the อังกฤษ.
Tom said Mary might have done it.
Tom wouldn't be able to do that in a day.
Tom, he's never gonna say he's got a boy.
I know that Tom's not going to be aร้องเพลงที่ดี.
I know what you're thinking about him.
Tom said they're not going to ປ່ຽນ that.
What do you want me to say?
It's been a matter of fact, but it's not a matter of fact.
I don't think Tom should beร้องเพลง.
So I thought Tom had this right now.
Tom told me that he's not interested in getting into theพิพิธภัณฑ์ on his way.
Tom's got all theseเล่นs.
I know what Tom was doing yesterday.
Tom and Mary said that they wanted to know the meaning of it.
Tom said he didn't find somethingแปลก.
Tom, I'm both out of the car.
I think Tom's gonna stop.
Tom said he wanted to say ฝรั่งเศส.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສູນ ເສຍกุญแจ.
Tom said they could do it.
Tom's not going to be home until 2:30.
He's gonna get what I'm saying.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was going to be up to the bedroom.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's gonna do by myself.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom told me that he was ປະທັບ ໃຈ.
What's going on?
I know Tom's gonna do it tomorrow.
I think Tom's been working as much as Mary did.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ຖືກ ລໍ້ ໃຈ ໃຫ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
The atomic of the เหล็ก is 26.
Is it the first time you ever had a skateน้ําแข็ง?
I'm gonna go get dressed.
It's a disaster.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ມີ ອາຫານ ການ ກິນ.
I don't think I'm going to be one of the most important things in my life.
คุณไม่ได้ตอบฉัน.
I think Tom's still gonna have to do that.
Both Tom and Mary ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ໄດ້ it.
Tom thinks Mary might do that.
I thought I could do that.
Dom Tom and Mary know that you've done that?
Maybe Tom wants to know that Mary's got to do that.
Tom thinks I'm a loser.
Tom knew that they'd be able to do that.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be gone.
I think Tom ບໍ່ ຄາດ't go on his way too long.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສະບາຍ.
Tom's one of the bad guys I know.
I'm not going to make a mistake.
Tom says he's gonna be a ฝรั่งเศส, but he's gonna say it.
Do you think Tom thinks it's gonna be impossible?
Tom said he didn't even think he'd be able to snuff this ລູກ ຊາຍ's hard.
I know Tom's a littleฉลาด.
นานแค่ไหนที่คุณคิดว่าฉัน ต้องอยู่ในบอสตัน?
Tom and ເມຍ have something to do with it.
Tom said he knew that Mary would do that.
I'd like to see you, and I'd like you to do it.
Tom said he thought Mary was ช้าเกินไป.
I feel like I'm going to do something else.
I hope you've got a lot of work on your own.
Tom and Mary told me that they were getting bored.
I know Tom's gonna be the only one.
Tom said I felt like that.
Tom thought Mary was the one who did it.
I don't think Tom ແລະ Mary's gonna be a ແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ: “ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ໂລກ ນີ້ ມີ ແຕ່ ຄວາມ ຫຍຸ້ງຍາກ ຫຼາຍ. ”
Tom and Mary said that they would be able to do it.
Theพิพิธภัณฑ์ is not open on Monday.
Tom told me he thought Mary was in a hard position.
I think we're gonna need to talk to you about it.
Tom said that they let Mary win.
Tom said he's not the only one who did this.
I know Tom wants to know that he's supposed to do it.
Tom wants to know that Mary's beenรอ.
Tom's the only one who's got to say ฝรั่งเศส.
It's been worse, it's fine.
Tom and Mary are both ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ ທີ່ ຈະ ຢູ່.
Look at me, you're the one who's going to be wrong.
I thought she was gonna หัวเราะ.
I know Tom wants to know that he's supposed to be doing that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said that theระเบิด keeps doing it.
I'd like to know that you'd like to do it for Tom.
Tom thinks Mary's going to be out of the house.
He said that he was ມ່ວນed by the French.
Tom wants to tell us that they're not gonna do that.
Tom said he's getting a little sleepy.
I thought Tom hadจ่าย to Mary, but perhaps I was right.
Pleaseตื่น at me at 6 o'clock.
I thought that's why Tom gave me that.
Where's Beer?
I thought Tom told Mary she should do that.
I don't think Tom's gonna do something.
Tom said that the อุบัติเหตุ ของ Mary is exactly what he's doing.
Tom thinks it's a stupid question.
Tom said he'd be ພ້ອມ to talk.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't think I'll be able to eat it.
Tom said he did the same thing.
He's done well.
Tom told Mary that he ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ ໂຢຮັນ ຮູ້ສຶກ ດີ ໃຈ ຫຼາຍ ທີ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ມື້ ນັ້ນ ຈະ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ.
Tom said they were forced to do that.
Tom's getting bored.
Well, I had to get rid of it, but I had to get rid of it, and I had to get rid of it.
Tom told me he's got to be late.
I don't think I'm gonna have a chance to be happy for you.
- You're the one who's got to be the one who's ever seen.
They don't want to live in a field.
I'd like to know that Tom's not even cooking.
Tom thinks it's a chance that Mary's not gonna be ณ การ ประชุม.
What's wrong with you?
Tom ບໍ່ ຄິດ Mary's been so glad that it's gonna be impossible.
I'm just trying to keep my eyes open.
I don't think Tom's gonna be too busy to do that.
I know that Tom and Mary can't be used to present themselves.
I'm going to eat it.
Well, I think he's out of here.
I thought they were all ຫຍຸ້ງ.
Tom knows that Mary is not gonna cry.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna be ອິດສາ.
I'm not gonna be able to do it again.
The boss said he was fired.
Let's go. We're going to get you out of here.
I know Tom's gonna be a prudent.
I think Tom ບໍ່ 'cause he's not going to be late.
Get off the dog!
Tom said Mary was probably probably pessimic.
ผมสงสัยว่าทอมอาจจะไม่มีเงินพอที่จะซื้อทุกอย่างที่เขาต้องการ
Tom might be one of the first ones to do that.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ ว่าฉันไม่สามารถทําอย่างนั้นได้
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຂຽນ ຈົດ ຫມາຍ ຫາ ເຮົາ.
Tom and Mary said he was a artist.
Tom's the only thing that's been found at Mary's party.
Mary told me that she'd leave the สามี.
Tom told me he's not gonna be here.
You've been able to make a long time.
Tom's probably worried about the man's name.
I was wondering if Tom knew that Mary was not doing that.
I don't think it's the man's fault.
Tom's gonna wear you a little bit better than me.
Did you get an idea of what the world's new year is?
Tom said they know how to do that.
I thought she said that ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຈະ ຢູ່ ຫັ້ນ.
I'm ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom's gonna know the answer.
Tom told me that he was going to be depressed.
It's been a matter of fact that Tom did that.
That's the line!
ພໍ່ ແມ່ ຂອງ Tom told us that ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ຕອນ ຍັງ ນ້ອຍ ที่ จะ ແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
Tom said he didn't think he was doing the same thing.
Tom said, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I thought Tom had to beโสด.
Tom told me that he's tooกระหาย.
I think he's supposed to be aโรงแรมเดียวกัน which he's been in the first place.
Did you think that's what they're trying to say, Tom?
I should've kissed Mary.
I thought you said you saw Tom do that.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not be able to do that.
It's not something I'm going to have to do with you.
Tom, I'm both right.
เลือดของเราทั้งหมดผ่านไตของเรา ประมาณ sixty times a day.
I think it's hard to do that.
She's pressing จมูกs against the glass.
I don't think that's what Tom's thinking is going to be.
เราน่าจะไปบอสตันเมื่อเดือนที่แล้ว.
Tom was supposed to do that as a result of his own.
I think Tom's gonna be able to marry someone like Mary.
No, I'm not. I'm sorry.
Tom didn't think it was the first time Mary had done that.
I don't think it's gonna be okay.
It's been anticipation.
So I thought Tom was gonna be able to quit the job.
If I can prove that Tom did, then I'm gonna fire them.
I've been eating sushi when I got it.
I'll never be able to kill the กฎหมาย again.
I don't think I'm gonna convince Tom that I'm gonna do it.
Tom, ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ບອກ ຄົນ who they are.
Tom told me that Mary's gonna be the first to do that.
I thought Tom was taken toบอสตัน.
Tom said he knew that Mary was ບໍ່ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ.
Tom said he'd never be able to get any money in theของขวัญ he'd given to Mary.
I don't think it's fair.
So I was wondering if Tom and Mary would be safe.
I think we're gonna do it until now.
Tom and I are both different.
Tom said that they're gonna know what to do.
I'm wondering if Tom and Mary were born.
Mary told Tom that she had the right to do something about it.
Tom said he'd consider the idea of it.
Tom is ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ວ່າ Mary needs to be.
I'm sorry to tell Tom how to do it.
Tom said that Mary was the only one to do it by itself.
Mary's got a blind spot.
Mary's been working on a ແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ ທີ່ ໄດ້ ຢູ່ ໃນ ນີ້.
I think Tom's not going to be aussed by what's going on.
I know that Tom's not just the same thing as จอห์น.
Tom's supposed to let some of the things he's been in for him.
I was wondering what Tom's เพื่อน would be like to talk about.
ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ໄດ້ ແນວ ໃດ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ເຄີຍ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ?
Tom said Mary ບໍ່สนุก.
Tom thought Mary was unpopular.
Tom and Mary said he'd be able to do that.
Tom was planning to do that yesterday.
Tom promised he'd be going to ออสเตรเลีย with Mary in ตุลาคม.
I know Tom's a little crazy.
I know that Tom may be able to tell Mary that.
I'm sorry I've allowed you to wait for so long.
Tom said he didn't believe he told Mary that he was willing to do that.
I thought I'd be with Tom.
It's anticipation.
I was wondering if Tom was so กลัว.
Tom said, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He said that he had ever been ศึกษา of ฝรั่งเศส.
I'mเป็นหมอ.
It's like I've been trying to avoid Tom.
I don't think Tom knows Mary would do that.
Tom told me that ພໍ່ ຂອງ ລາວ were just a ສອນ, too.
The ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ ຍັງ ບໍ່ ທັນ ອະ ທິດ ຖານ ເຖິງ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Tom was the one who had to do that.
Tom's been talking about how he's done to Mary.
I'd like to know where Tom's been.
I'm pretty sure Tom's right.
I think Tom did what he said.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ຄົນ ທີ່ ยืมรถของฉัน.
Tom was ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ວ່າ Mary ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I'm willing to buy Tom a ปัจจุบัน.
Tom said they didn't want to give me a little bit of money.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่ใช่ คนที่ควรจะบอก Mary ว่า เธอควรทําแบบนั้น
Tom said he thought that Mary was going to be such a runaway.
Tom told me that they thought it was gonna rain ມື້.
Have you heard of Rusor'sล่าสุด?
Tom told me he thought Mary was uncovered.
He's got to go back to his house, and he's gonna be a good friend.
I think Tom's on his way.
It's not gonna happen to you because you're not gonna be able to do anything wrong with it.
Is that the car of you?
Tomกําลังตามหาใครสักคน ที่สอนฝรั่งเศสให้เด็กๆ
Tom said he's got enough to do that.
Go and see if Mr. Wilson's home.
I think Tom's okay.
ผมไม่ทราบว่า Tom told Mary that they're gonna do that.
Tom's still alive.
Tom and Mary ຄວນ ບອກ ໂຢຮັນ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a cook.
Red, yellow, and blue are สี.
I know Tom's a กลอง.
Tom thought Mary was going to be a ออสเตรเลีย.
It's like Tom's fault.
I know Tom's got to be a little lighter.
In a little bit of an effort, Tom's gonna work.
I'm supposed to do it เมื่อหลายเดือนก่อน.
สะพานนี้ถูกสร้างขึ้นจากหิน.
I don't know what to do with Tom.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I know I've done the same thing, but I don't want to rub it in!
Tom's theที่ดีที่สุด.
I don't think Tom's gonna mind.
Both Tom and Mary are กลัวสุนัขของจอห์น.
So I guess Tom's not gonna do that.
Mary knows she's awake.
I think Tom's gonna be a little bit cooler.
I'mเกรงว่าทอมจะไม่มา
"Let me alone," she said, "Sudience.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
ຂ້ອຍ ຄວນ ເລົ່າ ເລື່ອງ ນີ້ ໃຫ້ ຄົນ ອື່ນ ຮູ້ ກ່ຽວ ກັບ ພະເຈົ້າ.
ข้ารู้ว่าเจ้าต้องกลัว
Tom told me that he thought Mary had been living inบอสตัน.
Tom and Mary say that he ບໍ່ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກที่นี่.
Shouldn't we be in a little longer?
Tom said he thought Mary ອາດ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
ฉันหวังว่าฉันจะดีในการพูดคุยกับผู้หญิง as Tom was.
I know what's going on.
I know that Tom's not gonna be doing that.
You're gonna take the lead in the marathon.
Tom's a germaphobe.
ฉันไม่คิดว่าใครจะชอบทอม
All right, let's do this to you.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna be able to go back with us.
I think Tom's the only one who's ever been in love with me.
Tell Tom he's supposed to be visiting ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom and Mary said that he was disappointed.
I'm going to have a lot of work to do.
They're walking down.
I'd like Tom to have a อภัย to Mary to do that.
Tom's got a car, but he won't be able to use it.
Let's go for the ramen.
I'm ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ເປັນ ຄົນ ທີ່ ສັດ ຊື່.
Tom told me that I'm anสุดท้าย.
Tom ອາດ ບໍ່ ເຕັມ ໃຈ ເຮັດ ຫຍັງ ເພື່ອ ເຈົ້າ.
I thought she said she'd rather do that.
I thought Tom was gonna be able to get out of the way.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าทอมและ Mary would probably haveอยู่ในบอสตันหรือไม่
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ he'd ever do that.
I hope Tom's going to heaven with me.
Water freezes at 0 องศา Centigrade.
The ขนมปัง I ซื้อ at the supermarket ບໍ່ รสชาติดี.
In Japan, the ปี ใหม่ เริ่ม ต้น ใน เมษายน.
I thought Tom was going to need a little help.
That's what Tom and I'm ຢ້ານing.
I thought Tom was out of nowhere.
They're a busier than a couple of them.
No, no, no, no, no.
I know Tom's a deal.
He's gonna stop her.
Tom says that ພໍ່ ແມ່ ของ ລາວ ยอม ໃຫ້ ລາວ ເຮັດ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ລາວ ຕ້ອງການ.
Did you know Tom's daughter was a child when he was a child?
I thought Tom knew that Mary was gonna do that.
I think Tom ບໍ່ ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ອະທິບາຍ ຂອງ ເຈົ້າ.
Tom said it's gonna be okay.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be advisable.
I think Tom was ແຕ່ງ ດອງ ใน เวลา นั้น.
Tom said he wanted to do it today.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to tell Tom.
Tom told me that he was scared.
ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຢູ່ ໃນ ຫມູ່ ບ້ານ.
What's going on?
To get the แหล่ง, you're gonna be veryว่ายน้ํา against the น้ํา.
I know that Tom's a little bit more than Mary was.
I thought it was Tom, but it was John.
What's going on?
Tom said he thought he could pass the test.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that on purpose.
หวังว่าคุณคงมีโอกาสทําแบบนั้น
Tom turned out to be a lot of money.
I don't think I can say ฝรั่งเศส.
Tom told me that he did that to her.
Tom doesn't even know how to play with theหมา.
I'm going to be full of time.
Tom said Mary was supposed to be doing that in the อื่น of the apostle Paul.
I'm supposed to be told to believe what Mary said.
I think Tom may have left.
I said I'm going to do that.
ຈື່ ໄວ້ ວ່າ ເຮົາ ທຸກ ຄົນ ຢູ່ ໃນเรือ ດຽວ ກັນ.
I thought that you were willing to tell Tom how to do that.
You're aอัจฉริยะ.
Tom and Mary thought that they could have an answer.
I think Tom might have done it.
Tom said he wanted to ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
Tom says he's not gonna get into a movie.
ฝรั่งเศสไม่ใช่ภาษาของฉัน.
I think Tom and Mary were determined to do that one week.
I'm still getting someลม.
Tom wants to know that he's supposed to do it by himself.
Doesn't mean that I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it.
Tom told me that Mary was a ແຕ່ງ ດອງ inเดือนที่แล้ว.
Tom's promised to pay for Mary three hundred dollars to ทารก.
You startled me!
Tom told me that they'd be careful.
Tom and Mary said they've been สอน to ฝรั่งเศส before.

I'm new to go.
I know what Tom used to do with what Mary ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
Tom said he thought Mary might be able to do it too.
Tom and Mary told me that they're not looking for trouble.
I think Tom's on his own.
I know what I see in the future.
Tom and Mary said he'd be able to do it tomorrow.
I know Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ແຕ່ ຄົນ ດຽວ ທີ່ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I think we should wait for 30 minutes.
I've been working on it. I've been trying to find out what you're doing.
I'm supposed to know Tom and Mary are gonna be them.
Tom told me that he and Mary had spent the summer on the beach.
They're all right, but they're not going to be a good idea.
I'm สงสัย Tom and Mary can do that.
That's right.
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to do it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ກໍາລັງ ຈະ ມາ.
I don't want to go ahead of you.
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to get to the ground for himself?
I know Tom's gonna be quick to do that than Mary.
I know Tom's a sniff.
I don't want to do that.
It's a habit of making a mistake.
Tom and Mary are both ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ ຍ້າຍ toบอสตัน.
Tom and Mary said he was thirty.
It's time to think about the past.
Tom's still gonna do it.
Tom and Mary said that he'd be able to do it anymore.

Tom told me that he ບໍ່ ມີ ສັດຕູ ใด.
Tom said he wanted to know how toว่ายน้ํา.
Tom said they could do that.
ผมแน่ใจว่านี่คือที่ซึ่งผมจอดรถ
I thought he had to go on to work on his own.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to get married.
Tom told me that he was in the military.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary can't be seen by the way.
Tom said he had hoped that Mary would know how to do that.
Tom says he's ວາງ ແຜນ to Boston for a year.
I think Tom was ลืม to do that.
Tom said he knew Mary might be allowed to do it by himself.
I know you're still alive.
You know, I'm older than I am.
Tom and Mary had allowed ລູກ to do that day.
I think it could be cocaine, but it's just aแป้ง.
I told Tom that he was ยุ่งing.
ເຈົ້າ ອາດ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນີ້ ໄດ້ ອີກ ບໍ່ ດົນ.
Tom's gonna be working out in the middle of the night.
I don't think I'm better than ฝรั่งเศส.
Tom said he's got a piece of เอกสาร that's จําเป็น to be done.
Tom, it's gonna be a lot of money.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນີ້.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຄິດ Mary was supposed to do that again.
เงินของฉันอยู่ไหน?
Tom and Mary said that they can't afford to ซื้อ ສິ່ງ ຈໍາເປັນ ສໍາລັບ $300.
I know I'm annoying.
Tom would've been doing it if he had done it.
I know Tom is the only one who can do that.
It's something that's going on in her.
I've always beenสับสนed by the brothers.
I know that Tom was ບໍ່ ຢ້ານing theหมาของ Mary.
I thought Tom was going to work out again.
I was wondering if Tom could've been able to do that.
I'm gonna do my best to keep up with Tom.
Tom gave Mary roses.
Tom said he didn't think I was doing that.
I know I'm the one who's done it.
Tom said he wanted to know more about it.
They're moving overtooks.
Mary said she ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ວາງ ແຜນ to do that tomorrow.
I'm going to see.
Tom said he knew that Mary would never be here until they were present with her.
Tom told me he's got something to do.
ฉัน ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom was supposed to do that again.

ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ພະຍາຍາມ ເອົາ ຊະນະ.
Tom and Mary said that he was right.
I thought Mary said she ບໍ່ got a แฟน.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
But I know that you're willing to do it.
I thought she said she hated Tom.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to do it by 2:30.
Now, I'm saying it, I can smell it, you know.
Are you suggesting that I'mโกหก?
Tom talked to Mary.
Tom said Mary was never too late.
I don't think Tom's gonna know who Mary was going to do that.
You're working out your father's work.
I'm guessing Tom's gonna go toบอสตัน.
It's not safe to ดื่ม น้ํา.
I know what to say to you.
You can tell me.
Mr. Tattuya, deals in the ข้าว.
It's just that it's the case.
Tom told me that he'd be able to do that.
I think he's got to pay attention to it.
I don't want to know what to do.
Tom said I'd be happy to see you.
ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ປະສົບການ ທີ່ ດີ ຫຼາຍ.
Tom said he'd like to hear something.
I was familiar with the way they asked questions.
I know Tom ບໍ່หล่อ, but I still want to say that he'sน่าเกลียด.
Tom told me he thought Mary was aน่าเกลียด.
I don't think I'm gonna do it again.
The ตํารวจ's gonna be on the inside.
ພະອົງ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຕອບ ຄໍາ ຖາມ ຂອງ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ.
I know that Tom was an ausched by what he was about to be administrative.
I think Tom's going to be out there and let's have our own father do it.
Tom says he's out of the way.
Tom said that he knew Mary would be able to do that.
I'm European.
Tom said he thought that Mary seemed to be depressed.
Tom said I looked ຫຍຸ້ງ.
I don't think Tom ສັງເກດ ເຫັນ ວ່າ ເຮົາ ຢູ່ ຫັ້ນ.
It's not as crazy as it sounds.
Tom said he'd like to be a long time ago.
ฉันไม่แน่ใจว่าฉันจะช่วยได้มาก
But I thought she was supposed to be theออสเตรเลียอาทิตย์นี้.
I think Tom's too late.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna be sympathetic.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສະແດງ ໃຫ້ ເຫັນ the albums of this guy.
I guess you can do that.
Tom knows that Mary's gonna scoff at us.
Tom said that he ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ ມັນ ຈະ ເປັນ ໄປ ໄດ້ ທີ່ ເຮົາ ຈະ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said that ທຸກ ຄົນ he knew nothing to do with it.
Tom and Mary told me that they were to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was getting hungry.
I thought Tom was gonna be able to do it.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary ແທ້ ໆ ທີ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ เมื่อเช้านี้.
I thought Tom was very interested in theกอล์ฟ.
You've got the place where you've been?
I think there's something wrong.
One of them is the only way to get to know Jehovah.
I think Tom's life is better than Mary's.
I don't understand.
I'm an introvert.
I'd never get toบอสตัน.
Tom said they're trying to convince Mary to do that.
You're right.
I knew Tom was doing it today.
I thought you were going to tell Tom ฝรั่งเศส.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ເຖິງ ເລື່ອງ ນີ້.
Tom said he knew Mary might be left to do that ໃນ ອະນາຄົດ.
Tom left about 30 minutes ago.
Tom said that he was just too good for Mary to do that.
I'm a graduate of all the high school, so I'm going to be able to ຕອບ the building, and I'm going to do it.
I thought Tom was downstairs.
I know Tom's gonna do what he says.
ผมรู้ว่าคุณไม่โง่พอที่จะเชื่ออย่างนั้น
Tom said they ສົງໄສ out if Mary and I can do that by myself.
Tom's supposed to be in the middle of the night.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าทอมเป็นคนประเภทที่จะทําแบบนั้น
I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary that she was supposed to do that.
I think Tom's gonna be fired.
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ບາງ ຄົນ ຕ້ອງການ ຂ້າ ລາວ.
Tom's gonna be on his way to the next three days.
Tom just wanted to do it again.
So I'm guessing Tom was a little bit of a mistake.
Tom told me that Mary was killed.
I'm ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ໄດ້ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ສາມາດ ເອົາ ຊະນະ ຄວາມ ຫຍຸ້ງຍາກ.
I don't think you're gonna tell Tom how to do it.
( ຄາ ລາ ຊີ 6: 4, 5) ຄື ກັບ ບາ ເຣ ຊີ ລາຍ ເຮົາ ຕ້ອງ ເປັນ ຄົນ ຖ່ອມ.
I'mค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่าทอม สามารถช่วย Mary.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຈົ້າ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນີ້.
I'm learning about the ອະນາຄົດ.
What's more important than that?
I know that Tom is the one who said he's gonna do it.
I know what Tom wants to do by myself.
นั่น ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເປັນ ແບບ ນັ້ນ!
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເປັນ ຄົນ ຢິວ.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນີ້ ຈະ ເປັນ ເລື່ອງ ທີ່ ສໍາຄັນ ຫຼາຍ.
Tom thinks Mary packs up in theกระเป๋าs.
I know that Tom would do that better than Mary.
It's aching.
Tom's about to ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ ວ່າ he's gonna be going to make sure he's going to be right there.
Tom and Maryตกลงจะอยู่ที่นี่ตอน 2:30, แต่พวกเขายังไม่อยู่ที่นี่.
They're done by the way?
I know that Tom's gonna be the only one who can do this if he does.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ claimed that he ບໍ່ร้องไห้.
Did you know Tom would be like to do that, huh?
Tom said he thought he had enough time to do that.
I've done everything I've learned to do.
I know that the Bible is not the only true God, but that does not mean that he is the one who does the will of God.
Tom told me he thought Mary was the first one to do that.
I know Tom's a bit of arbitrious.
I know Tom's gonna do that from me.
I thought they were gonna be okay.
I thought it'd rain that ທຸກ ມື້.
Tom and Mary tell me that they're going to get depressed.
Doesn't want to be sad about it.
ຂ້ອຍ ຄວນ ຄິດ ເຖິງ ຕອນ ທີ່ ກ່ອນ ຫນ້າ ນີ້.
What does it mean to know?
Tom says he's not too busy when he's gone to heaven.
I'm in charge of the crime.
- Why are you doing this?
I'm sorry to tell Tom that I'm meant to do that.
I'll be able to write a letter as long as I don't have time.
I don't know what to do.
I'll give you an answer to that very day.
I don't think Tom would be able to do that.
I know Tom's a little bit out of the อากาศ.
I think Tom's gonna be here.
Tom's about to do that.
Tom and Mary say that they're หิว.
I don't think I'm gonna have a lot to do with it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຫຍຸ້ງ ຢູ່ ກັບ ການ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ຕ່າງ ໆ ໃນ ຊີວິດ.
I'm supposed to be true.
I know that Tom is the one who said that I don't want to do it.
I don't know what to say.
He's got a โทรศัพท์.
I don't think Tom's gonna have to tell you how to do it.
Tom promised Mary that he would do it again.
Who knows I'm coming?
Tom and Mary said he's not gonna know what to do.
I've had a lot of money on my own.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
He said he was แคนาดา.
The fact that you're going to do is, I think you're gonna be able to do it.
I think Tom's gonna beว่ายน้ํา better than Mary.
I'm not gonna let you do that.
Tom told me he's got a lot to do with it.
They're still poisoning Tom.
I know, Tom, I know I don't want to do that.
I've got it!
I've got a lot to do.
Tom told me that they thought Mary would be the most powerful thing.
Tom said that Mary knew how she might be allowed to do that by herself.
I know that Mary ຮັກ ຂ້ອຍ.
I've enjoyed telling you.
I'm trying to find out what you're planning on doing with Tom.
Tom says he's not even gonna be a concert.

Tom's probably tickleish.
Tom said he'd be in charge of coming up on his way all the way out of the world.
Tom told me that he was hoping that Mary was gonna be okay.
Tom thinks it's gonna be fun.
It's been a while.
I don't think Tom's still gonna be there.
Tom said they're gonna wait for Mary.
Tom ພະຍາຍາມ do that, แต่ทําไม่ได้
Tom ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ຄົນ ອື່ນ ຮູ້ to be sad.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna be in the hospital if he did.
You've done it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I don't think Tom's gonna get Mary to do that.
Tom said they're not giving a book to Mary.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ.
Tom's gonna be willing to tell Mary that.
I think Tom's gonna be all right.
They're the ones who're going to make it.
I think Tom and Mary are both crazy.
I was wondering if Tom would.
- Tom's house's been burned by fire.
I don't think I'll do it any more than I thought.
You're gonna have to do that, aren't you?
คุณควรจะถามทอม how they do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ໄດ້ ຮັບ ຄວາມ ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ.

Tom said he'd never be able to put flowers to Mary.
I was wondering if Tom knew Mary ບໍ່ was doing that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້ ແລ້ວ.
Tom and Mary said that they were ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ແທ້ ໆ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
It's all right for you to know that you're not gonna be able to do anything.
Open the door, please.
Tom said that they knew Mary might not do that by themselves.
To the person who has been สงสัย, if the becon's beams must be burned as luxurious: คืนนี้เราพิสูจน์อีกครั้งว่า กําลังที่แท้จริงของ ชาติของเรา ไม่มาจากแขนของเรา หรือขนาดของทรัพย์สมบัติของเรา, แต่จากพลังของอุดมคติของเรา: ประชาธิปไตยและไม่มีความหวัง

I'm sorry.
Tom says he's just gonna be able to do that.

In the United States, people play a version of Mahjong.
Don't say a rubbish!
It's gonna be hard to figure out what's going on.

Tom wants to tell us that he's not doing that.
Why would it be possible for us to explain it to you?
Tom said that they thought they might be the only one who knows what Mary ຕ້ອງການ ເຮັດ.
This may be the case.
Tom told me that they're just doing that.

Shouldn't you write it down?

If I ບໍ່ do it, we're going to have to do it.

Tom said he'd wait for it any more.
The letter is not decorated.
It's not allowed to be left with your sister's lounge.

That's the first thing you need to do.

เมื่อคืน I puked.
You know, I ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຫມາຍ ຄວາມ ວ່າ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said that Mary may have been able to get it done by now.
So, I guess we're gonna do it today.
It's too สาย to ປ່ຽນ theตาราง.
I'd like to know where Tom was an uncle of Mary.
- Tom's father's making them ขายมอเตอร์ไซด์.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ເລີຍ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້ by itself.
It ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ໃຫ້ ເຮົາ ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ ໃນ ຕອນ ນີ້.
Tom said they're gonna do it by themselves.
They're gonna be fine. They're gonna be fine.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
We're the only ones who know who's got a fire.
Tom said he thought he wanted to do that.
I thought I'd make a little detour.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I'm the reason Tom did that is because he's the other man in the ครอบครัว.
Tom says they're theหมา-tired.
Tom assumes that he's the one who's done all he's ever been in prison.
I'm the one who's supposed to tell me what you're saying.
I thought Tom would like to know the answer.
I think you're supposed to be able to do it with Tom.
I thought Tom was going to pass the test.
I mean, it's not like Tom's gonna be the one who's gonna be able to say that he's gonna be a part of the world.
Did you know that Tom was the one who wanted to do it?
If it's true, Tom's gonna be right there.
I've been determined to do that.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ວາງ ແຜນ on his own.
Tom worked as a result of his own.
คุณแน่ใจหรือว่า ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ໄປออสเตรเลียกับคุณ?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ເຮົາ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ຊະນະ ໄດ້.
You can't say that Tom's going to be a whirlwind.
ฉันนึกว่านายเป็นเพื่อนฉันซะอีก
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary knew how to do that.
When the juicy comes, I'm gonna be in the middle of a กีฬา ใหม่.
I'd never believe that.
Tom and Mary are both ແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
Sami's got to be ລູກ.
Tom said they're working hard to do that.
Tom's supposed to be toบอสตัน by theเครื่องบิน.
Tom's just a little weird.
I thought I could do it.
Tom's been eating the sandwich that Mary had done for me.
ฉันมาที่ออสเตรเลียเมื่อ 3 ปีก่อน และฉันได้อยู่ที่นี่ตั้งแต่นั้น
Tom wants to know what to do with Mary's life.
I think I'm gonna win the game.
You're supposed to take down theรองเท้าs of your way to the entrance.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna say that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ໄດ້ ຍິນ ກ່ຽວ ກັບ ຂ້ອຍ.
Tom and Mary said he'd be ຢ້ານ to do that.
That's why it's important to be honest, but why is it so important?
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຖ້ອຍ ຄໍາ.
I'd neverทรยศ you!
Tom and Mary told me that they're having aปวดหัว.
Tom and Mary say that they're getting used to it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said that they want to know how to use it.
I think Tom's gonna be out on Monday.
Tom and Mary are going to be sorry that they did.
Can we tell me what Tom and Mary are going to do?
I think I'd like to see Tom again.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary did on Monday.
Tom's supposed to be able to keep this simple.
I know, Tom, I think I know what I want to do.
ผมไม่ทราบว่าคุณต้องการที่จะทําอย่างนั้นในขณะที่คุณอยู่ในบอสตัน.
I know that Tom's not a drumer. I think he's a spyer.
I don't know what to do.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ thought John would do that to Alice.
I hope Tom ບໍ່อันตราย.
Tom said he thought Mary was getting mad.
I thought Tom might be doing that by myself.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna be กลัว.
Tom said they're not going to be one of them.
Tom's been doing it on his own.
I know that Tom and Mary are bothโสด.
I'm gonna need you to get out of here.
Tom said Mary's supposed to be home tonight.
I've done it before.
Tom สามารถมากับเราได้ ถ้าเขาต้องการ
I know that you were aโรแมนติค of Tom.
Tom said they're gonna do that to you.
I'd like to tell you what to do when Tom told me that he'd do it.
That's the question I've been able to learn from you.
Tom knew I was in the middle of the night.
What's wrong with you?
I was so busy that Tom ບໍ່ was the only one who had to do what he was supposed to do.
Tom's got a lot more money than I had.
I don't want to read it.
I know that Tom is older than I am.
Tom said he didn't believe he'd be willing to ซื้อ Mary a birthday.
That's what Tom's gonna say.
They're going to have to do something ກ່ອນ ທີ່ ຈະ ອອກ ໄປ.
Shouldn't we get to the house today?
They did the same. They were just like a bad idea.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอม ไม่ยอมให้ Mary do that.
ผมสงสัยว่าคุณไม่ต้องทําอย่างนั้น
I don't think I'm gonna read it.
I thought you were the one who wanted to do it.
Tom's been ຢ້ານing to get the fuck out of here.
You're not playing?
Tom said he'd never be a ตํารวจ.
I don't think I'm going to be drinking this morning.
Where did you leave Tom?
Tom told me that they were ambidetrous.
I'm sorry that ຫມູ່ ຂອງ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຢູ່ ນີ້.
ทุกคน, like Tom and Mary, are in charge of taking the lead in the year.
Tom said he thought Mary would be interested in doing that.
I don't think Tom's gonna let Mary do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ອາດ ຈະ ดึกดําบรรพ์.
Tom's been on his way up.
Tom said they're not going to be here.
I don't know.
ผมไม่ทราบว่าทอมและ Mary วางแผนed to do that.
Tom and Mary say that they're used to be gone.
Tom said they're hoping that Mary can do that anymore.
Tom said he had hoped that he would continue to do that.
I thought Tom said he'd be able to ແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
You're done, right?
I know I'm doing it on my own.
Tom said Mary looked หลับ.
You're both Tom and Mary in Australia?
Tom and Mary are determined to be here by themselves.
Tom said Mary thought she was gonna do that.
Shouldn't you know how to take care of it?
I thought I'd be going toบอสตัน on Monday.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said he'd do that tomorrow.
Tom was probably the one who took the lead in his life.
Tom says he's not the one that Mary did.
Tom said he thought Mary had done it.
What's going on?
Tom said he ບໍ່ ເຊື່ອ ເລີຍ ວ່າ Mary did it by himself.
Let's get out a Polycard.
I think Tom's supposed to be on his way to Australia to visit me.
I thought Tom was not buying a car.
I don't think it's gonna be a matter of fact, but I don't think it's okay.
Tom said that she's not the one who's going to be able to do it.
I don't think Tom's gonna stand by that.
I know Tom's anผู้จัดการ.
Tom said that they know that Mary ອາດ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ by itself.
Tom said Mary was in the hospital.
Tom ສົງໄສs out what she could do to Mary.
It's just that it's hard to do it.
Tom said that Mary knew she might be allowed to do that.
That's just a little bit of aวาด.
It's ฉันสาบาน I'd never do anything like that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom said he was hoping that Mary would go to the party.
Tom and Mary say that he's not like beer.
Tom knows I ບໍ່ do that.
Tom said he's done.
It's not worth it.
I know that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ເຮັດ that.
But I think Tom might be able to do that anymore.
Tom told me he ບໍ່ ເຫັນ Mary.
I thought he said he'd be able to do that.
I think it's good for Mars.
Tom's ຄວາມ ຄິດ about to move so they're going to ใกล้ Mary.
I know Tom's aโค้ช.
Tom said Mary was too young to do that.
I know Tom's doing this to him.
Tom and Mary are both in thirteen.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to be a ออสเตรเลีย.
That's why Tom's been here for aออสเตรเลีย, because he's the only one who's ever been able to do it.
I thought you said Tom did it.
I don't think I'm gonna do it.
I don't think it's gonna be hard for Tom to do that.
It's like snowing.
I'm supposed to know.
ครั้งสุดท้ายที่คุณอาบน้ํา?
I think Tom's gonna be fine with the ฝรั่งเศส.
Let's see if I can run a little bit on the pillow.
I know, Tom, it's just that I'm up to you.
I think Tom had the same idea that they were going to make them dinner.
I know that Tom was a bit off the อากาศ.
Tom was determined to do that by Mary?
You want to know that the door is locked?
Theเค้ก that Tom baked was a ton.
He's a น้ําตา of the ສຸກ.
I don't think you're gonna need Tom's.
I think Tom's been ຢ້ານing to hurt Mary's ຮູ້ສຶກ.
I know that Tom is the one who's been doing it.
I've changed my life.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณซื้อไข่ไปแล้ว
ฉัน ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າทอม ຢາກ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນີ້.
Tom's gonna be able to speak French enough to get Mary out of here.
I think Tom really did it by myself.
I don't think Tom's gonna beກຽມ.
If it's a cold, it's gonna get rid of it.
Is everything okay?
I know Tom's gone.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
They're going to be as good as they're ever going to be.
I thought you were Tom.
I said, ถอยไป.
ฉันไม่คิดว่าทอมชอบคุณมากเท่ากับคุณ
You're gonna let Tomว่ายน้ํา, aren't you?
I thought Tom would do that.
Tom and Mary said they're ยุ่งing to do that.
But I thought they were able to take care of me.
I think Tom will do it as much as I can.
I'm sorry to start with you.
I'm sorry I've been letting you go yesterday.
I knew Tom would be able to do that.
Tom said that Mary knew she was able to do it until วันจันทร์.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ລໍ ຖ້າ ໃຫ້ ພວກ ເຮົາ.
Tom said he thought Mary was doing it.
Tom and Mary say that he ບໍ່ lives to be here by himself.
Tom's got a TV สี.
Tom's got to be out of town.
I don't think I've seen Tom do that.
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ບອກ ຄົນ ອື່ນ ກ່ຽວ ກັບ he's ວາງ ແຜນ to do that.
You can do this to yourself.
Tom should be telling Mary they're going to ออสเตรเลีย.
อังกฤษ กลาย เป็น เรื่อง ที่ ผม ชอบ.
I've been thinking about Tom and Mary's alive inบอสตัน.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่าทอมจะอยู่ที่นี่?
Tom said that he knew Mary might not do that.
What if it's going to work?
I'm just trying to find a way to do it.
Tom ເບິ່ງ ບໍ່ ຄື ກັບ ດີ ໃຈ ແທ້ ໆ ທີ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ມັນ ຈະ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ ກັບ Mary.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຫັນ ບາງ ສິ່ງ ທີ່น่ากลัว.

Tom thought he was wrong.
I know that Tom's gonna want to know if Mary did it by myself.
She's eating.

ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຢ້ານ.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Mary ຢາກ ເຮັດ ຫຍັງ กับ เขา.
I've been to ออสเตรเลีย every summer since I was thirteen.

Tom ຢ້ານที่จะยอมรับว่าเขาไม่รู้
Tom said he'd never have been able to do that again.
Tom and Mary said he was out of love.
Tawnyowls have grey or brown plumbage.

I think Tom's supposed to be ຊ່ວຍ.
มีใครเห็นทอมที่นั่น?
I'm pressed for the rest of my life.
I'd like to know where Tom and Mary worked.
She used to take care of her family.
That's how he's gonna say it.
Mary said that she's ວາງ ແຜນ to the finish.
Look behind you.

Tom said he thought he was going to do that by myself.
I said, uh, Tom, if someone was up to the room,
Tom said Mary knew they might do that by myself.
I don't think Tom should do that.

I think we should be able to do it by ourselves.

ผมอยากรู้ว่า เวลาที่คุณวางแผนจะทํา
I've lost my credit card.
I know that Tom and Tom are gonna be doing that.
Tom's been gone for almost three years.

You're going to be in the world for the rest of your life, aren't you?
I thought Tom was going to do it today.
ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ໄດ້ ແນວ ໃດ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ຈະ ເວົ້າ ແບບ ນັ້ນ?
I don't think Tom's gonna know who he's in Boston.

Tom said Mary was supposed to be in Australia for a year.
I'm ຢ້ານ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ມີ ຂ່າວ ດີ.
Doesn't even seem to be able to tell me that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຄືນ ມາ.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna be ready by the way he was.
Tom's supposed to beช่วย Mary.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຕັມ ໃຈ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I think it could be that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that.
Tom, he's not in the same position.
I don't think Tom would like to know if Mary's not even looking for him or not.
I don't want Tom to be able to give it to you.
I don't think he's going to be a part of the world.
He said that he would not be able to do so.
Tom and Mary found a glove off.
We're going to have a good time.
I know that Tom is the only one who's ever been able to do it.
Tom said that it sounds like an act of love for them.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ທຸກ ຄົນ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າเหงา.
- They're gonna get you out of here.
Tom's not gonna go on.
ເຈົ້າ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ວຽກ ຫນັກ ເພື່ອ ເຮັດ ໃຫ້ ສາຍ ສໍາພັນ ຂອງ ເຈົ້າ ກັບ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ ແຫນ້ນ ແຟ້ນ ຂຶ້ນ.
I'm so busy with Tom ບໍ່ ສະແດງ.
I thought, too, that's what Tom wants to do.
It's just that I'm going to use a cup of coffee on the floorcloth.
Tom said that he'd be fine.
I'm ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom's gonna do that if he says something about us.
I don't think Tom knows what's gonna happen.
Tom thinks Mary doesn't want a chance.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ຢາກ ອອກ ຈາກ ຄວາມ ຕ້ອງການ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ.
I thought Tom said that Mary would do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was in charge.
What's the matter with you?
Tom told me that Mary was the one who did that.
Tom told me that they're ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ ບໍ່ to ກິນ a lot of shit.
Tom would've had a lot of money to do with the murders of the mother.
I'm so busy that he wants to know that Tom's gonna be aฝรั่งเศส.
It's okay to smoke it.
I'm aเพื่อน, right?
Did we tell Tom?
Tom said they didn't have Mary to do that by itself.
Let's ฉลอง!
Tom told Mary that he thought John was in ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom told me that he was late.
Shouldn't you tell Tom about it ขณะเขาอยู่ที่นี่?
Tom told me that he's willing to be treated.
Have you ever thought of someone who's not evenฆ่าทอม?
Tom said he thought he was doing that for me.
I thought she said she was just going to do that.
You can beจมน้ําตาย.
Tom told Mary that he was just trying to be one of the most important things to him.
No more American slangs on Tatoeba, stat!
Tom said he ບໍ່ ເຊື່ອ ເລີຍ ວ່າ Mary was determined to be on his way.
I know Tom's gonna do it for me.
The weather's gonna take care of it as soon as possible.
Tom, I'm both... I'm both ມັກ to beว่ายน้ํา.
Tom says he ບໍ່ ຢາກ ໄປ เต้น with Mary.
Tom said the pain started 3 เดือนก่อน.
Tom told me that he'd be gone by the time he was going to make it.
Tom pretended he wanted to hear that Mary was seeing them.
Tom thought they're gonna need to know Mary.
I'm going to New York for a week.
ເລື່ອງ ນີ້ ເປັນ ພາສາ ທີ່ ຍາກ ຫຼາຍ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
ฉัน ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom's got to do that again.
Tom's still beenทรมาน.
เมื่อคืน I puked.
ทุกคนที่นี่ ยกเว้นฉันทํามัน
Tom is almost as tall as Mary is.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was going to be in the hospital.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm guessing you've already read it.
I think you're supposed to be doing it untilบ่าย.
Tom said that he's willing to believe that Mary's not gonna be the one who's ວາງ ແຜນ to her.
I think Tom ບໍ່ ມັກ ເຈົ້າ.
I was so busy that Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ຄື ກັບ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I thought Tom was supposed to win.
I can't tell you what you're doing.
I don't think I have to do that.
I know Tom's a little bit of a นอนer.
I think Tom's going to treat you.
It was the first time I met the museum.
Tom said he's going to have to let John drive.
Are they gonna be able to do more in the future?
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry to find out what kind of person you're doing.
Terrific!
I'm sorry, it's fine.
I'd like to hear that Tom was doing that.
Tom is about three years older than Mary.
It's important that you do it very well.
I think Tom was just pretending to beหลับ.
But I'm sure you're gonna say it.
Tom said they thought that I might be able to do it by myself.
I'm guessing Tom's going to be a lot of work.
Tom and Mary tell me that they're not able to be able to use the cash.
I knew Tom could win.
You're welcome.
Tom's got a collection on him.
Come on.
Both Tom and Mary need to say ฝรั่งเศส.
ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ is what it means.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຂົ້າ ຮ່ວມ ກັບ ເຮົາ ໃນ ເວລາ ທີ່ ເຫມາະ ສົມ.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary are gonna hate it.
Tom said they didn't think that Mary and I were going to be able to help him find out what he was going on.
You can see it on the top of the mountains.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຖືກ ປຸກ ໃຫ້ ຟື້ນ ຄືນ ມາ ຈາກ ຕາຍ.
Shouldn't you be able to do that without Tom's ช่วย?
We're gonna have to wait for him to be on theล็อบบี้.
I know that Tom's about to tell Mary to do that.
I've lost three kilos.
That's why it's not for Tom.
I know, Tom's almost as tall as I am.
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ອ່ານ ທຸກ ສິ່ງ as well as he does.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I knew Tom was going to help her.
I'm afraid they're gonna start again.
I'm sorry.
That's a very interesting thing to say.
What's wrong with you?
I'm familiar with the plan.
I don't know what to do with that guy.
She's getting old enough to get ใบขับขี่.
ความฝันของเขากลายเป็นความจริง
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສັນຍາ ວ່າ ຈະ ເຮັດ พรุ่งนี้.
I think that both Tom and Mary are ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ in Australia.
What do you think Tom's gonna do something?
I'll be fine if the ฝน's too late.
I don't think Tom's tired of hiking.
Tom could've been เสนอ to the ประชุมวันนี้, but he ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເປັນ, so he did.
Tom and Mary said he'd never beยอมแพ้.
ອາດ ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ເລື່ອງ ຍາກ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ຄື ກັບ ທີ່ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ມັນ ຈະ ເປັນ.
Boys, listen!
He said that he had no เหยื่อ.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tom thought he was ອ່ອນແອ.
Tom said he didn't have to.
Tom and Mary thought that they were the ones to do what they were going to do.
I don't think it's a good idea.
I know Tom's a เลือก.
The แผล ยัง ไม่ หาย.
I don't think Tom wants to know who's going to be.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary would do that.
I don't want to do this.
Tom said he thought Mary was one of the most important ones to do.
I'm supposed to be able to clean up my mind.
Tom said he thought he was almost too difficult to do that.
- [Grunts] - [Grunts] - [Grunts]
มีที่ไหนบ้างที่เราสามารถพูดคุยส่วนตัวเกี่ยวกับเรื่องนี้?
I guess I could.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເປັນ ຄື ກັບ ຄົນ ທີ່ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເປັນ.
I think I'm gonna be ຫຍຸ້ງ out for a week.
I think I'm the one who's ever seen.
I am so happy.
I think Tom's got a man who lives in Boston.
Both Tom and Mary responded to John.
But I know that he really wants to be a part of the world.
Tom said he'd never hear from me.
Tom said he'd like Mary to know where to drive.
ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ເວົ້າ ແບບ ນັ້ນ!
Let's go for a second.
I'm สงสัย Tom and Mary have both left behind to Australia.
Tom thinks it's gonna hurt.
It's not worth it.
It's a hard fight.
Tom's gonna stay away from me if you want to.
Tom knew Mary was with John.
- I'm sure I'm going to speak to you.
Tom said Mary was supposed to be at the party for a long time.
They're putting theบูตs on.
I thought he was on his way to Tom.
It's been a long time ago.
I don't think it might be Tom who's going to go through the night.
I'll do it.
Tom said he thought he was gonna do that tomorrow.
Tom was supposed to be doing that one week ago.
Mary said she ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ວາງ ແຜນ ຈະ ໄປ.
Tom told Mary that she was supposed to be home.
I think Tom has to be the next.
I'm supposed to be here.
I thought Tom was หิว.
Tom thinks that even though he's a little bit too hard, he can win the race.
Tom's parlor was likened to when the ลูกขุน พบ เขา ไม่ ผิด.
What's wrong with Tom?
Tom assumes that he's always been in the middle of the night to know that he's been in prison.
It's something that I'm doing well.
I thought it was true.
So we're going to make a mistake.
Shouldn't you ever agree with the invitation?
I don't know what to do.
I know that Tom's going to be a brother.
Tom thought he'd be willing to tell Mary how to do it.
Tom told Mary that he thought ໂຢຮັນ ບໍ່ ພໍ.
I ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ເຮົາ ຊ່ວຍ.
Tom and Mary told me that she thought she was supposed to have a lot of weight.
I know what you're doing.
But if you're not in the pen, I'll let you know.
I know what Tom wants to do.
I think it would be hard to do that.
Tom told me that he thought he could do that.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Mary was the one who did that.
I know Tom's a little higher than I am.
I don't think so!
I'm supposed to be a star.
Tom said he's going to hope he's not going to be able to get home by himself.
Tom told me he thought Mary had ever been the lead in the band of John.
If it's possible, we can't do it if it's possible.
I think Tom must have done that.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ອະນຸຍາດ ໃຫ້ ເຈົ້າ ເຮັດ.
Tom's eating.
Tom said Mary was ເຕັມ ໃຈ ຊ່ວຍ ເຈົ້າ.
I know Tom's a littleหล่อer than I do.
Tom and Mary said he'd be glad to know that.
Tom said they're gonna be ຫຍຸ້ງ at 20th.
I think I can do that better than I can.
I was wondering if Tom and Mary were going to be.
Tom and Mary said that they can wait.
Tom said that theทีม had to be faithful.
I thought Tom was not gonna start.
I don't think Tom's gonna be.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่สามารถเล่นกีตาร์.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ຄວນ ຂໍ ໃຫ້ Mary ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
He's an acelebrity-creaming of everything.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom loves to believe that Mary's ສາມາດว่ายน้ํา.
It's gonna be impossible for you, isn't it?
Tom could have been the one who was responsible for his job, but I still ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ ລາວ ເປັນ.
Tom, I know I'm working hard.
Tom told me he's going to be there too.
I mean, it's a good idea, Tom's not doing it.
I think it's a risk that we're gonna take.
I'm sorry I ບັງຄັບ ໃຫ້ ເຈົ້າ ເຮັດ.
I thought I said I'd rather do that myself.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna be กลัว.
Tom ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ແມຣີ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ລາວ ຮູ້ ວິທີ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom Weppelly said he'd do that.
Tom should've told Mary that she did the right thing.
Call me!
Shouldn't you tell Tom where he is?
You're going to have to think of the แนะ นํา.
It's good to eat. It's good to eat.
The paint's dry.
Tom's probably gone.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is.
Hi, I'm Tom!
Tom said he'd never be ແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຄິດ Mary's gonna do that.
Tom's probably going to be the same girl who's beenเดทed for three years.
You're gonna get away with me that ง่าย, Tom.
Tom's gonna give him everything he's ever said.
Tom and Mary said he was right.
I'm a drug addict, just like me!
I think I ບໍ່ ສົມຄວນ.
I think Tom's right here.
I'll be damned.
Tom was so busy that Mary ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ.
I don't think Tom knows I ຮັກ Mary.
ขอบคุณ ที่มา.
I thought Tom was gonna be there as soon as possible.
Both Tom and Mary are gonna be.
I thought she said she'd be able to see Tom to do that.
Don't hang up!
I'm probably gonna be a little bit better than Tom.
Tom's going to be so bad.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่า มีโอกาสที่ดี ที่เรื่องนี้จะเกิดขึ้น?
I thought Tom was gonna be at Mary's party tonight.
Tom's the only one that's in the corridor who ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເວົ້າ ฝรั่งเศส.
It's not worth it.
I'd like to know if I had a chance to do it.
I know that it's gonna be hard to do.
Tom's still missing something.
I know that you're the one who's got to do it.
Tom said he had hoped that he would be able to win.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would be able to do that.
It's not a big deal.
Tom thinks he's in a รัก.
I don't want to have Tom to do that by myself.
Tom said that Mary was gonna do that.
Tom wants to know that Mary's alive in Australia.
I thought Tom might have thought Mary was gonna do that.
I'm about to send Tom a birthday.
I'd say ฝรั่งเศส as well as I am.
Tom has told me the things.
I know Tom wants to know why he's not doing it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເຮັດ ໄປ ແລ້ວ.
I should've listened to you.
Did you get a umbrella?
Tom and Mary said he wanted to know.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom said he'd rather die than do that.
I think I'm gonna tell Tom everything.
I know Tom wants to know who's gonna be.
I thought Tom was bassed.
Notice that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that.
Mary said she's ວາງ ແຜນ to the พรุ่งนี้.
ຂ້ອຍ ຕ້ອງ ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ວ່າ ຕົວ ເອງ ມີ ຄ່າ ຫຼາຍ ສໍ່າ ໃດ.
Tom baked Mary a birthday.
I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary that she should do that.
Tom said he's got a lot to talk about.
Tom said it's supposed to be cool.
I think Tom knows when Mary's been hurt.
Then I'm guessing he's going to be the one that's going to be there.
I think we need to see him.
But I know that you're completely stupid enough to believe that.
I don't think we can do that.
Tom learned that it was nothing to do with it.
Tom said they're ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ວ່າ Mary ບໍ່ won.
Tom said he wanted to be Mary to take care of himself.
Tom's been in a ออสเตรเลีย for three years.
I'm sure Tom's been planning on doing that one week.
Is it true that Tom was trying to hang himself?
Who's going to say stupid?
I'm going to say my brother.
That's what Tom's gonna do to you.
I know that Tom is not gonna hurt me.
Tom, he's got to be honest with him.
We could just tell us.
Tom was just pretending he ບໍ່ ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ฝรั่งเศส.
Tom said Mary was ເຕັມ ໃຈ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ເພື່ອ ເຈົ້າ.
I think it's interesting.
Tom's getting away with it.
Tom told me he'd be inบอสตัน for a week.
Tom left me to know that he's ວາງ ແຜນ to be a ออสเตรเลีย for three weeks.
Tom and Mary said he'd do that.
ฉันทําไม่ได้!
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's gonna do.
I know what Tom used to do.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to come up with him when he's in Boston.
I don't think you can tell Tom what Mary did.
Tom's got to think about it for days.
Tom's doing a lot of work on the ร้าน, he's not going to be any longer than he's ever been.
It's just a matter of time.
Tom says they ເຂົ້າ ໃຈ ເຫດຜົນ ທີ່ ມາລີ ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
Forget it.
Tom said more than he was.
I thought Tom couldn't be the one that Mary gave them.
Tom said he thought Mary's gonna do that this morning.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນเป็นคนที่บอกผม ว่า Mary ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I hope that my son will be สงบ.
I'm gonna rip you in with the watery มือ.
I thought Tom might beโกรธing him.
I think Tom's old Mary's.
Tom said he thought he was supposed to do that.
Tom and Mary told me that they're not safe.
Tom thought he'd hear them say they were 'em.
I don't want to believe that's true.
It's a เพลง I've been told when I was born.
The road is a long way.
Tom's a ช่างไม้.
Tom said Mary was probably supposed to be a ออสเตรเลีย in the วันจันทร์.
It's gonna be hard to do.
I thought I'd continue to do that again.
Tom's gonna be too disappointed when he's not eating theสลัด which he's done.
You're both จากบอสตัน.
I don't think Tom knows that I'm the แฟน Mary's.
You'reโกหก her!
I don't know what to do, but I think Tom's not going to be a ສອນ.
I think it's an exciting time.
They're taking the forks off.
Tom and Mary said that they were ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ແທ້ ໆ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ໄດ້.
I think Tom's not gonna be able to do that.
I've got a bad idea.
Tom told me that he's not gonna do that.
Tom told Mary that he's determined to get intoบอสตัน for a long time.
I know Tom's a musician.
I think that's what people do.
I don't want Tom to know what to do.
ທັງ ສອງ ทอม ແລະ ຂ້ອຍ ຕ້ອງ ຊ່ວຍ.
You're going to be hungry, aren't you?
ผมสงสัยว่าเราเคยอยู่ในอันตรายใด ๆ
Did you know Tom's gonna win?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ snore.
The doctor said that the Ailment is scrutiny.
Tom told me that he'd never do that if I did, neither would I.
I know that Tom is gonna be left to do that.
Tom and Mary said that he ບໍ່ meant to hurt me.
I think Tom's gonna be in the middle of the day.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's not saying.
Like this guy, we're gonna need to get out of here.
Are you ແນ່ ໃຈ ບໍ ວ່າ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງການ ຈະ ເຮັດ?
I'm the only one who can do that for me.
I thought I heard aหนู in the kitchen.
I know that Tom would do it.
Tom's got a glass of it.
This will be done. ”
Tom said he thought Mary ບໍ່ ປະທັບ ໃຈ.
I thought about it.
Tom said he thought that the เศรษฐกิจ was in the shape of it.
I've been walking in Boston when I was 13 years old.
It's been a long time since I was born.
I think Tom's a lovable.
I'm going to have to ซื้อ รถ ใหม่.
In 1497, John Cabotd สํารวจ Canada.
Tom and Mary told me that they cried.
I think Tom's a good time for this.
Do you think it would be hard for me to do that?
Tom told me that he didn't do that.
But I know you're not the only one who's ever gonna be able to do it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was gonna win.
I think Tom's gonna be fired to do that.
I've been planning on doing that yesterday.
Tom's been thinking too much about what he's supposed to say.
Tom and Mary said they're gonnaร้องเพลง.
There's a park near the house.
ผมหวังว่าคุณจะได้โอกาสอีกครั้ง
This is the only way to get to know the truth.
Tom told me that he's not going to be able to go to the school tomorrow.
You know, you know, Tom's a thief.
Tom's got no idea to be back to Boston.
Mary made a สามี of breakfast.
It's a very good time.
I think Tom might be able to do that.
I can still remember it.
You know me.
Don't say anything.
I'll do it ໃນ ຕອນ ນັ້ນ.
Tom and I were both ยุ่งing.
Tom told me he'd leave the wife.
It's probably gonna be hard for Tom to win.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Tom was doing that.
I mean, I ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ Tom told me I was not doing it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້เกษียณ.
Tom said he'd be able to do it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom told me that Mary wasหิวd.
Tom and Mary thought that they knew the woman.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
He said he's gonna beat him up.
I think you should let Tom know that he's the French.
I know Tom wants to know about Mary.
I'm sorry, Tom.
I'm gonna hold on to the heat.
Tom and Mary said he wanted to know.
I'm just so busy as I am.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເປັນ ຄົນ ແບບ ໃດ.
I don't think it's about who you are.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณวางแผนจะทําวันนี้
What's Tom going out to Mary?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງການ ບາງ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຈະ ກິນ.
Tom, ຊ່ວຍ ຄົນ ທີ່ ຂໍ ຄວາມ ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ ຈາກ ພະອົງ.
I know Tom's a member.
I think Tom's gonna be on his way.
There's a book that's not a date.
ເຮົາ ບໍ່ ມີ ທາງ ຕັ້ງ ໃຈ ຄອຍ ຖ້າ ທີ່ ຈະ ຢູ່ ນີ້ ອີກ ດົນ.
I know Tom's not an oldฟัน.
But I thought she was supposed to do thatตอนนี้.
Maybe Tom wants to know where he's probably gonna be fired.
Tom was not walking down, but Mary had hoped that he would come out and go.
I don't think Tom knows how to เต้น.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tom, I know I'm on my way home.
Four times two is eight.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຄິດ ເບິ່ງ ວ່າ ການ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ເປັນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ສໍາຄັນ.
Tom said that they were all right.
I think Tom's never gonna talk to me again.
It's not the ลม that's up to you.
Tom's not gonna go on until 2:30.
Tom's the only one who knows who's been to Australia.
But I'm sure you're not going to tell us what you're doing.
That's why he's wearing a scotch.
Hurry up, Tom.
We should be able to make a call.
If they're not here, they're gonna be able to do a good job.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ.
I'm going to have a negative word.
Tom and Mary said that they're not gonna do that.
Tom, I'm both busyตอนนี้.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ອິດ ສະຫຼະ ທີ່ ຈະ ເລືອກ.
I don't think Tom's gonna be the one to do it.
Tom said it was like Mary was having a good time.
Tom told Mary that he ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ ໃນ to do that.
อย่างน้อยคุณควรบอกทอมและ Mary that ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ອີກ.
I know Tom would've been crying.
I think Tom's not gonna make it to ออสเตรเลีย.
I think I can handle it myself, but I do.
It's gonna be nice.
Tom assumed that he'd always know that Mary was going to do that.
I know that Tom wants to know what Mary's doing by myself.
Tom says he's gonna be veryว่ายน้ํา right now, though, as Mary.
That's a movie idiot who's ever seen.
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to be here.
- What's wrong with you? - Yeah.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was in charge of going toบอสตัน for him.
Let's go to the park where it's noisy.
I think Tom's got to do that.
I thought I'd be long gone.
Where are you going?
Tom and Mary said'd overstayed วิวิสa.
She's dreaming of a dream in the night.
Both Tom and Mary areเหนื่อยing.
I think both Tom and Mary are under 30.
Tom and Mary said that they wanted to know what to do.
I'm sorry, I'm pretty ອຸກ ໃຈ.
Tom's got some tithes that Mary showed up.
I don't think Tom's record said it for himself.
These are the things that are done to you.
Tom and Mary said that he had a plan to go to the where he was.
It's what it's like to eat.
Tom said he'd be able to do it again.
Tom said he thought he'd be able to do it until ตุลาคม.
Tom says Mary's a นอนy.
Tom said he'd never go out early.
I thought Tom was going to be a fool.
ผมไม่แน่ใจว่าผมทําได้
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to see that.
ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ໄດ້ ແນວ ໃດ ວ່າ Tom ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້?
Tom's got a good word for the ຄອບຄົວ.
Tom can see what Mary ບໍ່ is.
Tom said he had hoped that he would know how to do that.
Both Tom and Mary have been เงียบs for a long time.
I'm getting to know it.
Even if I had a lot of money, I'd be able to ซื้อคอมพิวเตอร์นี้ทันที.
We're mounting it.
Tom and Mary said that they're not going to be able to do it on time.
I think Tom would like to know if Mary would be able to speak French.
Tom told me that he's not gonna be the one who's gonna be able to help him.
The price of the ข้าว is rose by three percent.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said that they've been told that they've been told about the future.
Tom knows that he's not gonna be able to fix it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tom's gonna do that if he doesn't know why.
I hope Tom knows that he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
They're getting drunk.
I'll do it for you if I don't have enough time.
I know Tom's got to be inบอสตัน.
Tom said he thought it was gonna raining on Monday.
Do you think Tom's not gonna do that?
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna be the hesent to do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ວຽກ วันจันทร์.
I think Tom's been expecting someone.
I know Tom's a little lighter than Mary was.
Tom said he didn't know what to do.
I know Tom wants to know who's not doing that.
Tom said Mary was wrong.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງການ ເງິນ.
Tom said they thought that Mary was on his way to the ออสเตรเลีย.
Wait!
I told Tom that I'd be doing a lot of things in Australia.
Tom did that on purpose.
I thought Tom's got a party in the wrong place.
I know Tom wants to know that he's not doing it.
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to do that.
Who's the photographer?
ฉันรู้ ทอมเป็นเจ้าของปืน แต่ฉันไม่รู้ว่า เขามีปืนมาก
I need to understand.
ฉันโชคดีที่ฉันยังทําได้
They're taking the โทรศัพท์ away.
ผมคิดว่าทอมคงช่วยเราได้ ถ้าเขาไปที่นั่น
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕື່ນ ເຕັ້ນ ຫຼາຍ.
They're the แพทย์.
Tom and Mary should be used to use their own language.
Tom and Mary said that he'd like to be a good man.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said he was getting bored.
Tom's got to get out of the house.
I don't think Tom's gonna be drunk with him.
I'll watch TV.
I don't think Tom knows when the ประชุม begins.
Tom and Mary told me that they ບໍ່ would do that.
I think Tom would like to know that the world wasขโมย.
Tom and Mary are about to be taken toบอสตัน for a while.
Let me out of the หญ้า.
Tom and Mary said he was so lonely.
Tom said he was supposed to be there.
Is Tom the only one who ever lived in Australia?
As a กฎ, we're three o'clock in the morning.
Did Tom really think I ເຊື່ອ that?
I'm playing Volleyball.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ ໄດ້.
ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ that.
I don't think we do that.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ຄົນ ທີ່ ຮັບ ຜິດ ຊອບ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ.
Tom said he thought Mary wasหิว.
I thought Tom wasอยู่กับ Mary.
I know that Tom's not gonna be the one to do that.
ສິ່ງ ນີ້ ອາດ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ ກັບ ຄົນ ອື່ນ.
I know Tom's the only one in the apartment.
I'm a woman.
That's what I'm doing.
Tom's supposed to be coming home.
Tom said Mary was probably supposed to be early.
Tom told me he thought Mary was fine.
ผมรู้ว่าคุณไม่ได้ทํามันตอนนี้.
ເຮົາ ຮູ້ ແລ້ວ ວ່າ ເຈົ້າ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
I think Tom's gonna be okay.
ทอมรู้ว่า เขาต้องทําบางอย่าง แต่เขาไม่รู้ว่าอะไร
I'm sorry, Tom did.
Tom said he was hoping he could win the race.
Tom wants to know that he's ວາງ ແຜນ.
- You're the one. - You're the one.
Dom Tom and Mary know that they're willing to go?
Tom said they thought they'd be able to do it by 2:30.
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to go, too.
Tom loves to believe that Mary will take care of himself.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna do that.
I don't think it's gonna be hard to convince Tom to do that.
Tom said he thought he was gonna do that.
Tom's ສຸກ.
Both Tom and Mary were incarcerated.
Tom said they thought Mary might be allowed to do it by itself.
I'm gonna hear it.
Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied.
I don't think Tom knows the whole thing.
I think Tom just wanted to see me.
Put on theเสื้อ.
The same is true of me.
I'm the musician ທໍາອິດ ໃນ ຄອບຄົວ.
ບາງ ຄົນ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ຄວາມ ຮັກ ແທ້ ບໍ່ ມີ ຢູ່.
It's been a while, and it's been a while.
Tom told me that I'd be able to use an คอมพิวเตอร์.
That's the first one I met in Australia was Tom.
They're all gonna need help to get to Boston.
Tom and Mary tell me that they're looking for it.
They know that Tom means a business.
Tom said Mary was trying to leave John to do that after the birthday.
I don't think this is the right thing.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ບໍ່ ດີ.
Tom said he's just gonna be happy to have a big deal with Mary.
Tom said it was one of the reasons why Mary was not doing that.
It's a bad day that's how it works.
Tom told me he thought Mary was downstairs.
I know that Tom thinks he's supposed to be doing that.
Tom and Mary are gonna be able to take pictures of theพรุ่งนี้.
They're the ones who are in the middle of the night.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ເຊື່ອ ເລີຍ.
I'mค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่าทอม ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ว่าผมกําลังจะทําแบบนั้น
Tom's got to be a bit ເມື່ອຍ when he's home.
I'mค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่าทอมไม่สามารถพูดฝรั่งเศส.
Tom's gonna be right there.
ฉันไม่คิดว่าคุณกินมัน
Tom said they're going to have to do that.
I thought it was hilarious.
Tom's doing a lot of work on the ร้าน, he's not going to be any longer than he's ever been.
I thought he said he wanted to talk about it.
I don't know what to do with Tom.
Tom told me that they're รีบed over Mary.
I don't think Tom's gonna need to be.
Tom told me he thought Mary was out of fire.
It's not a matter of fact that it's worth it.
Tom knew how to do that?
Tom convinced me that you were the one who had to be the most important person in the world.
Tom thought Mary ບໍ່ would do that to them.
That's what's going on.
I think Tom's been taken toบอสตัน in the summer.
What's the matter with us?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ກໍາລັງ ຫຍຸ້ງ ຢູ່ ກັບ ການ ປະຊຸມ.
I know that Tom's up to theกระเป๋าhouse.
คุณคิดจริงๆ เหรอว่าคุณสามารถโน้มน้าวทอม ให้ซื้อมันให้คุณ?
I don't think we're going to see anyone do that.
Tom said he'd say he'd be a ฝรั่งเศส.
I'm supposed to be from theฟัน last week.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເປັນ ຄົນຂີ້ ອາຍ.
I don't think Tom's acalypse.
I'm scooped.
Tom and Mary gave me a lot of cars.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ເຫັນ Mary for a long time.
Both Tom and I were the ones who did it.
Tom told Mary that I was in the middle of the night.
I know that Tom and Mary are both trained.
I don't know what to do.
Tom says they're all aware of how to do that.
I thought Tom was willing to tell Mary how to do it.
He must have had the ability to do so.
Tom said he jumped out of the way.
"มีใครอยู่กับคุณ?" "No, I'm the only one."
Don't pretend I'm sorry.
Tom toldทุกคน that he was reluctant to do that.
The box's not going to work!
But I thought he said that he was not going to come toบอสตัน.
I've been at the house yesterday, who's been ຮູ້ຈັກ for Tom.
I know you can get away with it.
It's only a few minutes ago when they're knocking on the door,หมา starts barking.
Both Tom and Mary areมีปัญหาเดียวกัน.
ไม่มีทางที่คุณจะทําได้ด้วยตัวเอง
It's about to be okay with Tom.
Theบิล was hard to calculate.
I don't know who's going to be in the truth.
I've never met someone who's ever been like me.
It's gonna be hard to do that.
Tom's probably too young to do that.
Tom's gonna ພະຍາຍາມ ຊ່ວຍ Mary was doing that.
I could use this gift to help you get better.
Tom thinks it's gonna be a good idea.
I'm sorry I told Tom the truth.
Tom and I were both from when they were going to church yesterday.
What's the matter with you?
Do you think Tom's gone out?
I thought, if Tom had to tell you how to do it,
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่า Tom's ever been aบอสตัน?
I don't think it's gonna rain, but I'm gonna take a umbrella in the case.
Tom promised he'd never tell you.
Tom said he thought that ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ รีบ.
Both Tom and I must be loyal to you.
I'm going to have a bad idea.
Tom said he saw a ghost.
Tom thinks Mary's not gonna be lonely.
Tom and Mary say that he is not gonna be right.
The umbrella did not go to Tom?
Tom was supposed to do it all night.
I know Tom's almost never been able to get home on Monday.
I thought Tom hated him.
I know that Tom can't do that by myself.
Tom said they're gonna be retiring.
I'd like to know where Tom was playing theแตร.
Do you think it's gonna rain in the year?
I know, Tom, probably ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຄວນ ເຮັດ.
I don't know what to do. I don't know.
It's gonna be a lot of money, but it's not a good idea.
Tom told me that he was lonely.
I thought Tom would be ຫຍຸ້ງ.
What's the name of the CEO?
I know you're learning about Tom.
I thought I'd be fine.
Tom thought he was on the street.
We don't need to hear what Tom said.
Tom said they're going to visit Mary to ออสเตรเลีย for a year.
They're geometry queens.
No, it's all right.
It's gonna be a พายุ.
Tom's still gonna be สงสัย.
Where's the ประชุม going?
I think Tom was wrong.
Tom said Mary thought John might be able to do that.
I thought it would be easy to do that.
Tom said he's going to have to do that.
It's not as cold as it was yesterday.
That's not theเกม to the boy.
I hope you'll beรอ to you.
Tom said he had been hoping that Mary would go on.
Tom said Mary was ກັງວົນ.
Tom and Mary said they were ມ່ວນing the fridge of the French.
Tom said that he's not gonna be the only one to do it.
I was wondering what Tom was doing.
I am from South America.
I'll do it again.
I don't think Tom would like to know if Mary was going to go or not.
I thought Tom's gonna be a little กล้า to do that.
Tom ບໍ່ 'cause he's not gonna be able to do anything about it.
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
Tom said he'd never let Mary do that.
What do you think Tom's not even aเบสบอล?
I'm going to speak to you later.
ຫຼາຍ ຄົນ ເຊື່ອ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຈະ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ.
Tom knows that he's supposed to be able to eatถั่ว.
Tom told me that they're gonna พยายาม again.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom said he had a strong confidence in Mary.
Tom thinks he might be able to do that anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna be gone by the time he was going to get there.
I think Tom's gonna let Mary do that on her own.
Don't you know.
I thought we were going to be a ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom told me that they thought Mary was a terrible thing.
ฉันไม่แน่ใจว่าทั้งสองทอมและ Mary ຢາກ ໄປที่นั่น.
I don't think it's gonna take long to do that to you.
I think Tom ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ໄປ ກັບ Mary.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom, I'm both advocate.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ รีบ.
But I know that you're in the wrong place, but you're not going to have to worry about it.
I'll be right there.
I've read it.
Tom's never been out of here.
Did you know that Tom's purposed to be an ประชุม for this time?
I thought if Tom ever asked Mary what she was doing was fired.
Tom said Mary would never be able to do that.
They're theประเภท of theดนตรี I'm not ຟັງ.
She crouched herself a jumper.
I know Tom's been doing the same thing.
Tom ບໍ່ ແມ່ນเป็นคนที่บอก Mary that she ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
I know that Tom's been ຢ້ານing to the ตํารวจ might be จับ.
I'm guessing Tom wants to visit ออสเตรเลีย.
I don't think it's going to be quite a matter of time.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ນັ້ນ ເພື່ອ ຂ້ອຍ.
It's been a long time since we were taught.
I think Tom was able to do it by 2:30.
I've got enough money to ซื้อ Tom a ปัจจุบัน.
Tom's not gonna see anything.
I thought he said he was going to be the one who said he was going to be.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຢ້ານ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Mary is in the middle of the 14th year.
I think Tom's gonna be here.
I've done things too much for you.
I think I'm drunk enough for you.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮັກ ຂ້ອຍ.
Tom said Mary was gonna do that to จอห์น.
I knew Tom was doing it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ຫຍັງ ເພື່ອ ຈະ ໄດ້ ຮັບ ຄວາມ ລອດ.
The gauge is broken.
- You can't do this! - You can't do it!
Shouldn't you be in the party?
Tom said Mary was a driver.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ມີ ເງິນ ຫຼາຍ ເພື່ອ ຈະ ໄດ້.
I'm sure I'm going to speak to you.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna want to be a noisy.
She was on the scene of the crime.
I know that Tom knows he's supposed to do it by myself.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be interested.
Tom said he didn't think he was allowed to let Mary drive.
Tom thinks Mary's a cook thing.
So I'm the one who's been thinking about it.
Tom said he's gonna be okay.
I'd like to know that Tom was walking on Park Street.
It's aต่อรอง.
I should have done it for you.
I know that I'm supposed to be the one who's supposed to be Tom to do it, but I do.
I thought Tom knew that Mary would do that.
I'm gonna check on Tom.
I hope you're all right.
What do you think Tom's been สงสัย, right?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຊ່ວຍ.
They will not be able to do anything that will please God.
Tom and Mary said that they were embarrassed.
I don't know what to do.
Tom said that they สงสัย Mary would do that.
Tom's gonna be สงสัย as well as you do.
As long as I'm concerned, I think it's true.
It's not going to be great.
Tom knew that they'd be able to tell Mary the truth.
They're not going to be a part of the world, but they're not going to be a part of the world.
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້จ่ายฉัน ເທົ່າ ເທົ່າ ໃດ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ພະອົງ ສັນຍາ ໄວ້.
I think we're gonna be able to do whatever we want.
Tom was ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ, Mary wasโกหก.
It's merciless.
Tom said he wanted to lock the car.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຫນ້າ ທີ່ ຮັບ ຜິດ ຊອບ ຂອງ ຕົວ ເອງ.
The car made a หันไปทางซ้าย.
Tom and Mary said he's only doing that once.
I thought Tom might have done it.
I'm gonna go ປ່ຽນ.
Tom's probably gonna be about to graduate.
Tom's got a ticket to Mary.
Tom said Mary to ปิด theวิทยุ.
ทุกคนยกเว้นทอมและแมรี่รู้ว่า พวกเขาไม่จําเป็นต้องอยู่ในบอสตัน
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณจะมา
I know that Tom is a little bit younger than Mary.
You know, we're gonna have to find out what happened.
Tom's house was burned down, too.
Tom said he was going to be able to do that.
Tom and Mary said he ຮູ້ສຶກ ຄື ກັບ ພີ່ ນ້ອງ ร้องไห้.
But I know you can do it right now.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ໂງ່ ແທ້ ໆ.
I think Tom did well.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sorry.
ผมว่าเราไม่ควรทําแบบนั้น จนกว่าจะถึงเดือนหน้า
Tom said Mary saw John do that.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເບິ່ງ ຄື ກັບ ນ້ອງ ຍິງ ຄົນ ຫນຶ່ງ.
Let's get to Tom Cap.
ผมจําไม่ได้ว่ารหัสผ่านทั้งหมดของผม, ผมเขียนทั้งหมดลงไปในสมุดที่ผมซ่อนไว้ ที่ซึ่งผมไม่คิดว่าจะมีใครหามันเจอ
It's getting worse.
Tom thinks he's a man in the room who knows that Mary needs to understand ฝรั่งเศส.
I thought Tom was ສຶກສາ to ฝรั่งเศส.
It's not worth it.
Tom told Mary that he thought John was never gonna do that.
I don't know what Tom is about to do.
Tom said he didn't know how to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy inบอสตัน.
I thought you said Tom was a quartor.
I was wondering if Tom couldn't be a เต้น at all as Mary did.
Tom's not gonna hear us.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said they'reเหงา.
I know Tom wants to be at the wrong time.
I thought I was going to get a lot of money.
Sami ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ เจ้าของd.
Tom said Mary was probably going to be ສຶກສາ to ฝรั่งเศส.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຮັດ ເພື່ອ ໃຫ້ ອິດ ສະຫຼະ ໄດ້.
Please สัญญา yourself that you ຈະ ບໍ່ ມີ ວັນ ເວົ້າ ຕົວະ ອີກ.
Tom told me that I had to find out when I was older, but I didn't know what to do.
Why did you tell Tom that he's coming?
Tom and Mary were doing that because of their own.
Tom and Mary said that they really want to be.
Tom, let's talk to you about it.
Tom and Mary said that they were in prison with the ต่างดาว.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าฉันควรจะอยู่ที่นี่ by 2:30.
I thought they were able to do it.
You know, you know, you're a member of the world.
I think Tom's almost as tall as he is.
Tom's got a boy until he was thirty years old.
It's going to be a mistake.
I don't think they can trust me if I don't.
He did that.
It's all right, but it's a good thing to do.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເປັນ ຄື ກັບ ດິນ ດາກ ທີ່ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຄີຍ ເປັນ.
You know, Tom was like a barber, right?
Tom, pull down a book and start reading it.
Tom's the only one who's ever been waiting for.
Tom said Mary was gonna win.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ມີ ອາຫານ ການ ກິນ.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมจะไม่ทําอย่างนั้น ถ้าเขาไม่จําเป็นต้องทํา
เราควรอยู่จนสิ้นปาร์ตี้
Tom said he was ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ແທ້ ໆ.
You know, it can be done.
Tom and Mary plan to be in Boston?
I think Tom's gonna be at home tomorrow.
Tom said he might have done it again.
ພະເຈົ້າ ຮັກ ເຮົາ ທຸກ ຄົນ.
I think Tom's, and I'm going to do it again.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ພວກ ເຮົາ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ ໄດ້.
I think I've lost aกุญแจ.
Tom told me he thought Mary was innocence.
I know Tom's crazy.
Tom said he wanted to know what to do.
Tom told me that he wasป่วย, which means that he wanted to be true.
Tom's sorry, he's the only one who's going to do it.
Tom and Mary are taking their sculptures off.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be in the middle of the night.
ทุกคนที่นี่รู้จักทอม.
Tom and Mary said they're gonna ເຊົາ สูบ.
Tom and Mary told the waiter that they were not sitting by the window.
He's done.
Tom said they thought it would be safe.
Tom said they could prove that Mary did it.
I've done that ຫຼາຍ ຄັ້ງ.
Tom and Mary told me that they were in pain.
Tom and Mary said that they did it.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary was supposed to do that again.
I mean, it's a good idea, Tom.
I'm supposed to be able to report it to the ตํารวจ, but I want you to do it.
I don't think I'm an aproachable.
Tom's got a cat or a สุนัข.
I don't know what to do.
Tom and Mary know that they should be able to do that.
I've been thinking about Tom and Mary as well.
I think Tom's got to find aกุญแจ.
I'm sorry I said that.
I think Tom's not going to be destroyed if he knew how important the ປະຊຸມ was.
Do you think Tom's been committed?
Tom's gonna พยายาม รักษา Mary to do that.
I don't think I'm gonna do that.
Tom told me that Mary was a suicidal.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ ລໍ ຖ້າ.
Tom said he thought that ພໍ່ ແມ່ of them were gonna get married.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่ใช่ คนที่ควรจะบอกแมรี่ ว่า เธอไม่จําเป็นต้องทําแบบนั้น
I should've told Tom to be เงียบ.
It's not like that.
Tom's gonna be gone.
Tom said he thought I was gonna do that.
Did you know it was the first time I did that, huh?
I'm going to tell Tom that he's on his way.
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.
Tom thinks that even though he's a little bit too difficult, he can win the race.
Tom's got at least a few times as if he did.
Tom said they're going to ask Mary to do that.
I think Tom's the only one who's ever been in love with me.
I was wondering if Tom would be able to do that.
Tom, we're going to say, and we're saying that he's not going to be here until 2:30.
I'm sorry to hear that you're not.
You're the most important thing in your life. You're the most important thing in your life.
But if you're not going to be able to say it, I'm gonna let you know.
Tom said that he was supposed to be a chance.
Tom said they're ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ແທ້ ໆ ວ່າ Mary should do that.
They should've told Tom that they're doing the right thing.
I know, Tom, what I'm about to do.
Tom said he didn't find Mary to do that.
Tom told me that I'm not gonna be fired.
I'll let you know the ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ ຫຼັງ ຈາກ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ໄດ້ ปรึกษา ทนาย.
Theอากาศ's going to be fine as soon as it was yesterday.
I don't think Tom knows how Mary was able to do that.
Tom and Mary were told that they would win.
I know Tom's a showoff.
I'm not saying it's a long time.
Tom and Mary are about to be left by 2:30.
What I do, let Tom know he's gonna do it.
Tom, I don't know how to do that.
It's a birthday today.
It's been a matter of fact, Tom's probably done that.
He said that he meant to win.
Tom told Mary that I wasเหนื่อย.
I think Tom wants to know that Mary's going to be in the hospital.
What's going to be doing today?
I thought Tom was gonna be able to fill hisขนมs.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said that he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຮູ້ສຶກ ສະບາຍ ໃຈ ໃນ ທຸກ ມື້ ນີ້.
Tom said he thought they'd สามารถแก้ไขรถของ Mary.
I know Tom's gonna do that either.
I'd like to know that Tom was about to ask Mary to do that.
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຈື່ ໄວ້ ວ່າ เขา ສົມຄວນ ໄດ້ ຮັບ ຄວາມ ຮັກ ຈາກ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I know that Tom's gonna be able to do that in my own life.
I'm not here for Tom to go to the hospital.
I need to get the door open.
Tell Tom that I'm gonna be a littleอาบน้ํา.
Tom and Mary said he'd be here.
Tom said they're not going to be ຫມູ່.
Let me know if something is missing.
The world's not going to need any attention.
ญี่ปุ่น is a parentอุตสาหกรรม.
Tom assumes that they're beingตาม.
That's what's wrong with you.
Tom said that they're gonna be from theฟันs on the 20th.
You're gonna have to eat by yourself by twelve-thirty.
Don't ever leave.
It's like Tom's ปัญหา.
ผมมั่นใจว่าคุณทั้งคู่จะทําได้ดี
That sucks.
No, you're not.
Tom told Mary that they were not doing that today.
They'reแพทย์.
Tom said he thought he'd never do that.
The cellphone's going to be free.
I'm afraid Tom was one of those.
Tom and Mary say that ທຸກ ຄົນ ທີ່ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ສາມາດว่ายน้ํา.
Tom and Mary said he'd be here.
Tom says he's kind of aสับสน.
Tom showed me the room.
It ບໍ່ ງ່າຍ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I think he's looking for you.
I'm the one who's ever been.
I can't wait until I'm in the car for the first time.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom said they're trying to understand how they're gonna do that Monday.
Tom and Mary said that they were lonely.
It's time to go to bed.
Italo Calvino's gonna be back to Italy when he's going to be a little boy.
I knew Tom was just going to get started out of the house.
You know, it's gonna take Tom more than three hours to do that?
ฉันไม่คิดว่าเราจะชนะได้
I know what Tom wants to do.
Tom knows he's supposed to be able to do it by himself.
If anyone says something, I'm glad to talk to you about it.
These are the ones who know the truth about God and his Kingdom.
I told Tom that I didn't want them to do that.
Tom and Mary ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເລືອກ.
She's not going to cook up to the ຄອບຄົວ.
I think Tom said it was wrong.
Tom said they thought they might be left to do that.
Well, I'd like to know Tom's a little bit.
I think Tom's probably not going to be home early.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was a good man.
I don't think I've seen anyone do that before.
Tom said they're not doing anything by itself.
She's been up early.
Tom said Mary was probably going to come toบอสตัน for them.
Tom and Mary said he was always cheating.
If I were, I'd like to have it.
Tom said he thought I was gonna do that.

Everything's negotiable.
Well, I think that no one's gonna want to help you with that.
She's up to theโรงแรม.
He's got a little fancy to travel.
Tom said they're ສຶກສາ to be the แพทย์.
I know that I ບໍ່ used to do the same thing.
Tom said he had nothing to do with him.
I know, Tom, it's like, uh... it's a lot of a lot of money.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ມີ.
Tom's ຫວັງ Marys was trying to find a way to do something that John said he would do.
ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ມີ ວຽກ, so I'm never going to need a lot of money.
Tom's been crying all night.
I know that Tom was never a งานก่อสร้าง.
I'm gonna turn it back to you.
นี่คือภาพลวงตา: คุณคิดว่าคุณมองลูกบาศก์, ในขณะที่จริงๆแล้วคุณมองหน้าจอ.
It's a อัศจรรย์!
I don't think Tom knows where the man Mary's father is.
Tom thinks Mary's not gonna be going to the ออสเตรเลีย to see John.
That's what I'm saying.
Tom said he's not gonna know Mary, either.
Tom's a stroll faster than Mary.
Tom and Mary said he wanted to have a insurance.
Tom told me that he's going to be home on the 20th.
I know it's important to keep it from time to time.
I've made aกาแฟให้เรา

I'm sure Tom's gonna stand by that.
Tom and Mary said that he's gonna need to know.
Tom told me that he'sลืมing the ประชุม.
I don't think I can do this again.
Should I tell Tom that he's gonna be fine?
Come on, tell me!
Tom said they know who it is.
Tom knows that he's supposed to do that anymore.
Tom said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tom said he thought Mary was really right.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາບານ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
But I thought he was ยุ่งing.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary's about to do that.
I know, Tom, I know I'm not doing that.
Tom's an artist.
I'm working on it.
That's what the Bible says.
I thought she said that she was not the one who did that to Tom.
You're gonna pay for it.
Tom and Mary wanted to find out what to say, so he told them something.
I thought she said she hated that.
I think Tom's not going to be a สอนr anymore.
Tom's been strangled out of the moaches.
Tom and Mary told me that they'd be ຫຍຸ້ງ.
Tell Tom that I've been in a fishing.
Tom said that ພໍ່ ແມ່ of them had beenอยู่ที่นั่น.
I'll always have a little blunt in my heart to Tom.
พวกเขาบอกทุกคนที่ที่ทํางานว่า พวกเขากําลังจะเกษียณ
Tom wants to know when Mary is not doing that.
Tom told me that he'd be better than Mary.
You're gonna be able to get a video of the card to play the game.
Tom and Mary show me theตารางของพวกเขา.
Tom said Mary was probably inexcriminated.
I thought I said I did it.
I don't think she's got it.
Tom said he thought he might be able to do that.
I thought she could not know.
Tom and Mary say that he ບໍ່ ສຶກສາ to ฝรั่งเศส.
I knew that Tom would show me how to do it if he asked them.
I'm ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ.
I think Tom's gonna be out of the 20th.
Tom assumes that he's a man of the room, who knows Mary, he needs to understand ฝรั่งเศส.
I can't do this.
Tom said that he's a sympathetic.
I think Tom's gonna be the first to do that.
I'm a compulsive บ่นer.
Perhaps they're still telling Tom the truth.
I think Tom had no idea how to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was the only one.
It's darker than it is.
I don't think Tom would care if I did.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom wants to know that he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom and Mary said he had a plan to do that Monday.
I don't think Tom might want to know what's going on.
I know Tom was cheating.
Did Tom know that you were ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ in Australia?
They're the only ones who're trying to say it's French.
Tom said he'd never go down there.
Driving ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຂ້ອຍ ມັກ ເຮັດ.
ผมสงสัยจริงๆว่าทอมจะสนใจลงทุนในโครงการดังกล่าว.
I just thought Tom would be interested in ຮຽນ a รัสเซีย.
Tom and I are going to get married.
I know Tom wants to know who he's doing.
Tom should be happy.
Tom was willing to do what he ຕ້ອງການ.
No, I'm not gonna move!
Tom said he thought that Mary wasตกลง to do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ດີ ໃຈ ຫຼາຍ ທີ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Then you'll be able to put it behind you and move on.
But if we've been ตาม ຄໍາ ແນະນໍາ ຂອງ ຂ້ອຍ, we're not going to be able to help you.
I'll keep you safe.
Tom was just pretending he ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ.
Tom and Mary said that they were getting bored.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ ว่าพวกเราเป็นคนที่ทําแบบนั้น
Tom said Mary was getting a little bit ເມື່ອຍ.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณจะไปที่นั่น
I know Tom is allowed to do something that he does not do.
Tom said Mary was กลัว.
The only way to do it is to wait and see what happens.
Tom said Mary should've been here.
I thought it looked like a scoop.
Tom told me he's not going to clarify me.
Tom told Mary that he thought ໂຢຮັນ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ປະສົບ ກັບ ການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom and Mary said that they wanted to be able to do what they were doing.
Doesn't seem like I'd never have told Tom anything about it.
Shouldn't you say it as soon as you can?
I'm sure you're not gonna be in the middle of it.
Tom said I'd like to hear it.
I think you can do this.
But I know that everything's going to be a good thing.
I know Tom wants to know that he's gonna do it.
Tom said that Mary's got something to do with it.
I don't think this is the case.
I thought Tom was not gonna do that.
Tom's been with Mary to theพิพิธภัณฑ์.
So far, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tom and Mary must have had advent on theทีม.
Tom thinks they're not doing that.
Tom said Mary was supposed to do that as a result of the day.
Tom and I are both to blame.
I thought he said he saw the man who did it.
I've been working on it yesterday.
Tom thinks Mary's not gonna win.
It's like a toy.
I thought the bus was free, but I had to pay.
Tom said they're not going to be back toบอสตัน for a while.
We're gonna beat you!
She's promised to give me a ring.
Give me a picture of her!
I thought Tom was going to be inบอสตัน last month.
I pawned theกีตาร์ to theเช่า.
Tom, I'm the one who's gonna be able to help me get to know him.
- They're the ones. - They're the ones.
Take it both Tom and Mary, just like a ดนตรีคลาสสิก.
Tom said he thought he was gonna be allowed to do that.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ something she's จําเป็น to do.
I hope I've had a chance to ask Tom such a question.
I know that Tom is never too early to do this because he looks like he's the one who wants to be.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່'s got to be the only one.
I guess you can do that.
Tell me the truth and theอับอาย of the พญา มาร.
ຖ້າ ເຈົ້າ ມີ ຄໍາ ຖາມ, please come up here.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຄີຍ ພົບ ກັນ.
I thought you'd never go.
Tom, I'm both a man and a man, and I'm doing things inบอสตัน.
I'd like to know that Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to go.
Tom says they're not in any detail.
Tom's probably gonna have to wait for it.
I'm grateful.
You're gonna be born without the water.
มีโอกาสไหมที่คุณจะกลับมา ออสเตรเลียอีกครั้งปีนี้
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຖິງ ແມ່ນ ແລ້ວ ກໍ ຕາມ.
Tom said he'd be happy to go over there.
Tom said Mary was gonna do that.
Tom said I'm supposed to be a ฝรั่งเศส.
The situation is not safe enough.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was gonna be so ຢ້ານ.
I'm sorry I told you yesterday.
Tom said he'd never see anything like that before.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that if he wants to.
Tom knows I'm out.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ເຄັ່ງ ຕຶງ ຫຼາຍ.
Do you think Tom's a lot?
He's never been able to find out.
Tom said they thought it would be better if Mary did.
I think Tom's gonna do that.
I don't think that's a ຫຍຸ້ງຍາກ.
He's got to be used to it.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary are gonna do that too.
I'm sorry I told you that.
Tom's a little welcome to ฝรั่งเศส.
I thought you were strangled.
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເກີດ a blind thing.
Tom and Mary said that they're not doing this every year.
Tom told me that he had promised Mary ບໍ່ would be the hesitant to do that.
I think it's supposed to be the guy who's supposed to be a friend of the world.
I don't think Tom wants to know.
ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຊ່ວຍ ເຮົາ ໃຫ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
I'm going to leave you there.
Tom and Mary said that they knew to win.
Tom said he's got a email.
Tom thinks it's gonna be a good idea to see the หมอ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຢາກ ຮູ້ ແທ້ ໆ ວ່າ.
What's going on?
I thought she said she ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
คุณไม่ได้กลัวผีs, huh?
I think it's hard to find Tom.
I gave up a letter to Tom.
Look, I know you're going to need some help.
Tom and Mary said he's got a lot of fun.
ເຮົາ ຮູ້ ວ່າ you'reโกหก of Tom.
The word's on the gourd is like it.
I'm going to pay for that.
I know I'm supposed to be late for Tom, but I've got a lot of time.
I don't think it's like Tom and Mary do it for me.
I want you to do it.
I used to think that Tom and Mary were ແຕ່ງ ດອງ ກັນ.
I don't know what to do with Tom.
Tom's gonna be gone.
What's going on in the mountains?
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ว่าเราทําไม่ได้
Theจักรยาน is blue.
It's just that it's gonna happen.
I thought you said you saw Tom do that.
I know Tom wants to know what to do.
I know that Tom can't be a sculpture that Mary made.
I'm supposed to tell Tom that I need a ฝรั่งเศส.
I know Tom wants to know that I should do that.
Tom told me that Mary was a sympathetic.
I'm gonna get off the phone.
Tom ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ ການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນີ້ ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ເລື່ອງ ງ່າຍ.
I'm supposed to be out of here tonight.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
Tom's the only thing that's going to happen.
Maybe they'll be able to understand something or two of them.
I'd like to have Tom and Mary used to beว่ายน้ํา for me.
Tom's unharmed.
I know Tom's aอัจฉริยะดนตรี.
I don't think it's gonna be better.
Tom thinks Mary's on his way.
I don't know what to do.
I think he's supposed to be out of bed.
Tom and Mary say that he ບໍ່ ມັກ to do that.
Tom taught Mary to do that.
คุณไม่มีโชคมากใช่มั้ย?
Tom told me he'd put it out.
I'm supposed to say no to you.
Tom said, no, no, no, no.
He's been redundant.
Tom told Mary that he's been so busy that she'd go to ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom told me he wanted to be.
Tom said that they knew that Mary was supposed to do that.
Tom said he'd never do that.
I'm up to you.
The สี is a little lighter.
You and me both know that Tom is not doing that.
It's just that I'm gonna have a good idea.
ผม พยายาม เกลี้ยกล่อม ทอม ให้ มา ออสเตรเลีย กับ เรา แต่ ລາວ ບອກ ວ່າ ລາວ ມີ ສິ່ງ ອື່ນ ໆ ທີ່ ລາວ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
Tom might be crying.
Tom said it was something that told Mary to do.
It's the first time I've fryed an egg.
Tom said they're gonna be a ติดer.
Tom might be here.
Tom thinks Mary's not gonna be like John.
Tom and Mary said he was ຫຍຸ້ງ.
ທຸກ ຄົນ เว้นแต่ Tom ຮູ້ ວ່າ ລາວ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ມັກเบียร์.
It's gonna ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ ອີກ.
If only the idea is that it's going to be out ofปาก ຂ້ອຍ just like a receipt of it.
I think Tom might have beenรักing Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was active.
That's the only thing I'm going to do.
The world’s history is not the same as the world’s world.
Tom's got a lot ofสักs.
I think I did something wrong.
The only thing that Tom was going to eat is a piece of ขนมปัง.
ผมไม่ทราบว่าทอมมีแมวจํานวนมาก.
Both Tom and Mary would beอยู่ในออสเตรเลีย ເມື່ອ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເປັນ ລູກ.
I know that Tom is like a Lieutenant.
I don't have to.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be in Australia for a while.
I don't think Tom's overdosed.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่าฉันไม่ต้องทําแบบนั้น?
Tom ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ ເປັນ ເລື່ອງ ຍາກ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
ครั้งนี้, มันจะ ແຕກຕ່າງ ກັນ.
That's a way, by the way, it's a way.
You're supposed to smoke it.
Tom said he thought he'd สามารถช่วยเรา ໄດ້.
I think we're gonna do it.
There's no need for this to happen.
Tom'sหนักing more than Mary did.
What could Tom do?
I'm sure Tom's gonna be embarrassed by that.
I thought Tom was going to be the สํานักงาน.
Tom said he thought Mary was just going to be happy.
Toms let Mary do something she's not doing.
ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ Tom's gonna do that on his own, huh?
Then I thought I was gonna do it again.
Tom told me that Mary wasป่วย.
Tom said that I had nothing to do with it.
But I'm sure I'll protect you.
If I knew about it, I would have told you.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said they're gonna be able to do the same thing.
Tom told me that he thought Mary might not be ຮຽນ French.
Tom said he thought it would be possible to do that.
The weather's not gonna take care of it.
Asked if they could be happy, Tom said he was.
I thought she said, "ไม่สามารถวาด."
Then I thought, "I don't know what to do."
ເຮົາ ຈະ ຮູ້ ໄດ້ ແນວ ໃດ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ຄວາມ ຈິງ?
You don't have a chance to come?
ไม่มีทางที่ฉันจะทําได้ ถ้าไม่มีนาย
So I'm assuming it's just a coincidence.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
Tom said he'd be able to do that on Monday.
I know Tom's a big deal.
I'm still going to come toบอสตัน as long as I can.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ ทอม ຍັງ ບໍ່ วนเวียนรอบๆ เพื่อทําแบบนั้น
I think Tom's been barking up the wrongต้นไม้.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ໄດ້ what he said.
It's hard for Tom to say that they're not.
Did you know that Tom and Mary are about to do that?
ເຮົາ ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ເລີຍ ວ່າ's been recorded.
Good morning, man.
You're going crazy.
Tom said Bengali.
I've been thinking that Tom ບໍ່ ມັກ to do that.
Drunkards and เด็กๆ ບໍ່โกหก.
Tom ເບິ່ງ ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ he wants to know what to do.
I think Tom would like to know that Mary has just been ຮັກing him.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ມ່ວນ ຫຼາຍ ກັບ ການ ສະແດງ ນໍ້າໃຈ ຕ້ອນ ຮັບ ແຂກ.
What's up?
I think I'm supposed to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might be able to win.
Tom said he'd be willing to go ahead of time.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna be okay.
Tom and Mary told me that they know the risks.
Have you ever been drunk with aไวน์ that brings you?
I thought Tom was not gonna ซื้อ that to Mary.
I know it's been hard for you to tell Tom about how to work.
I've promised Tom that I've been crying.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna be boring if he did.
I thought Tom would ever do that.
What do you think Tom's gonna be here?
They're gonna say it.
Tom was just trying to pretend that he was a little bit ເມື່ອຍ.
I don't think I'm gonna tell you how to do it.
As it is common, it is sweet, so it's almost as bad as it's worth it.
I don't know what to do with that.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าเราควรทําวันนี้.
God’s Word says: “The world is passing away and so is its desire. ”
Tom said that it's not exactly what they said.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Mary was a แคนาดา.
But if you are not going to leave, you can.
I know Tom ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ being one of the most important ones to do that.
But I think you're not gonna be able to do anything about it.

ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom's still fine.
Tom's got a glass of wine off.
Tom's ເລີ່ມ to keep an eye on something that's not going to be able to do it.

Tom said he'd like to be home early.
We're in the middle of the night.

I've had a lot of questions.
Tom's asking.
I know Tom's aว่ายน้ํา better than Mary was.
I know Tom's gonna pass the test.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be in love with me.
I thought that's why I did it.

I'm thinking about it.
I think it's not like we're going to have a family in the kitchen.
I'm ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom's gonna wait for him.

Tom, you're going to have to get it back to her.
Tom and Mary are taking the lead.
I know you're going to be out of here.
I think Tom's still going toบอสตัน on the fall.
I know Tom's gonna be there.

ทุกคน, I'm Tom, who's the one who said he's got to go to Boston.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຈົ້າ ວາງ ແຜນ ຈະ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້ ແນວ ໃດ.
I think I'm not gonna be going to be a part of the world.
-We should've been able to get back to Tom.
But I know you're crazy.
I know that Tom is the one who's ever been taught by Mary.
I thought Tom and Mary would be willing to remember me, too.
I'm guessing Tom's gonna be able to do that.
I think Tom's gonna be กลัว.

Maybe Tom was able to do what he said.

I've said I've never been able to do it again.
I'm sure Tom's gonna wait a little longer.
I noticed that he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເຈົ້າ ຄວນ ເຮັດ.
I thought Tom did it in the wrong way.

It's been a while since Tom did it.
2 + 2 is equal to 5, for the same thing as a two.

Tom and Mary say that they're getting antsy.
Tom ຄິດ ວ່າ ລາວ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້ ບໍ?

Tom ບໍ່แปลกใจที่ Mary used to know how to help him.
Tom used to know Mary would do that?
I'm guessing Tom and Mary were not willing to be to go to Boston for him.
I'm fine, and I'm okay?
Tom ອາດ ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ เขาไม่ควรช่วย Mary do that.
I don't think Tom's got enough to know about it.
Tom said he wanted to know what Mary was ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
You're ອິດ ສະຫຼະ ທີ່ ຈະ ໃຊ້รถนี้.
Well, I think we're going to do it.
They're gonna have to tell Tom how to do it.
We must keep it from beingท้าย in the year.
I knew Tom would tell me how to do it if he asked them.
I don't know what to do.

มีโอกาสไหมที่คุณจะมาบอสตันปีนี้?
Tom and Mary told me that they're gonna be here.
หวังว่าคุณคงรู้ ว่าสิ่งสุดท้ายที่ผมอยากทํา คือไปโดยไม่อนุญาต
Don't make a promise that you have to do this.
I think I've been given a 1 เดือน to finish it.
I think Tom might be the one who works.
I'm not gonna let it happen.
I know Tom's not gonna tell you.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a good-looking girl.
So I thought Tom might be able to tell me what to do.
I thought you were doing things that Tom said ບໍ່.
We're gonna have to hope that Tom's not gonna be able to do anything.
I don't think Tom would like to know what Mary's doing.
Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ เขาคาดหวัง to do that.
Tom said that Mary was a little optimistic.
Tom told me that they thought Mary was up to be fresher than Alice.
Tom's gonna be embarrassed if he did.
Maybe we're the only ones who can do that is Tom.
I thought Tom would never be able to do that to him.
Tom thinks he's gonna be in Australia for a long time?
I'm guessing he heard from Tom.

I think Tom's got hots for him.
I thought Tom might have ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ to you.
I'm unintelligent, but at least I'm ready to know it.
Tom said Mary was supposed to be in Boston for a long time.
Doesn't seem like he's gonna be able to get home.
Tom says he's not going to win.
I thought I was just going to be a little late.
Tom said he'd be able to win it.
Can you open your eyes?
Tom said Mary's home.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຮົາ ຄວນ ເບິ່ງ ຕົວ ເອງ ວ່າ ການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ເປັນ ເລື່ອງ ຈິງ ຈັງ.
Tom says he ບໍ່ ຢາກ ໃຊ້ ເວລາ ใน คุก.
ข้าเกรงว่าเจ้าต้องทํางานข้ามเวลา
Tom said he thought he'd take care of himself.
Good-bye, I'm going to keep him on the street.
I don't think I'm gonna read itตอนนี้.
I think Tom's a ปรับ.
Tom said he thought he'd be able to do that because of what he said.
So, I thought, if Tom's gonna beว่ายน้ํา, she's gonna be fine, she's gonna be fine.
I know Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ to do it anymore.
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to do it.
Tom and Mary told me that they were on their way up early.
I don't think so.
I thought Tom and Mary were gonna be able to get to use it for a month.
Tom said that they're not Mary and I'm self-destruct.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ 3 ເທື່ອ ແລ້ວ.

I know that Tom knows Mary's supposed to do that.
I know Tom's aฉลาด.
Tom and Mary realized that I wanted to know how they were.
แทบ ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຮົາ ເປັນ ພີ່ ນ້ອງ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ບໍ່ ດີ.
I don't think that's what Tom's doing.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna let us go home early.
I heard that both Tom and Mary were out of fire.
The show's on Monday.
Tom said they'll do that.
ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.

We don't need to see what we're looking for.
Tom believes that it's gonna be impossible.
Tom said he thought Mary was wrong.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna be gone.
Did you know Tom was gonna do that?
I'd like to know if you could find out what's going on.
I'm just about to call you, but you beat me against it.
Tom's not gonna let Mary know what to do with her.
I'm just so busy when Tom said that he'd do that.
I think Tom and Mary are แคนาดา.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
ເຈົ້າ ແນ່ ໃຈ ບໍ ວ່າ ເລື່ອງ ນີ້ ຈະ ເຮັດ ວຽກ ນີ້?

ສິ່ງ ຕ່າງ ໆ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເກີດ ຂຶ້ນ ສະເຫມີ ໄປ ຕາມ ທີ່ ເຮົາ ຄາດ ຫມາຍ.
Tom and Mary told me that he wasลืมing something.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said that this was the case.
Tom said they're trying to understand how they're gonna do that on the 20th.
ເຈົ້າ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຮ້ອງ ເພງ ສໍາລັບ ພວກ ເຮົາ ໄດ້ ແນວ ໃດ?
I don't think it's a good time to think about it.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom was the one who was supposed to ບອກ Mary to do that.
I think he's gonna have a chance.
Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to leave at 2:30.

I'm right.
Tom said he didn't think Mary wasโกรธing.
Tom says he's not even stying theพิซซ่า that Mary did.

Go to bed!
Tom called Mary and told her that they're gonna be in Boston for more than 3 years.
Tom said he'd like to 'em where he'd put aกุญแจ.

They're putting theหมวกs on the left.
Who would be stupid enough to do that?
Tom wants to tell Mary he's not happy.
Did you know Tom told me that he's gonna do that, right?
Tom ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
What's one thing that you don't have to do?
You know, it's a good idea that it's gonna be okay.
Tom said he did the same thing.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງ ປຸກ ປຸກ ໃຫ້ ຟື້ນ ຄືນ ມາ ຈາກ ຕາຍ.

I'm sure Tom's gonna hold him back.

I think Tom had the same idea that they were going to have dinner with him.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
The price of theน้ํามัน is too high that it's going to be in the same place as you're going to have a car.
What did you say that you know how to do that?
Tom told me that he's still going to be careful.
"Crears." "To what?" "for everything."
I'm going to be a ສອນ.

We've got a chance.
If Tom had enough money, they'd be in Boston for Mary.

He's the only one who's ever been in the middle of the night.
What's going on in the world?
The พายุ ก่อ ความ เสีย หาย มาก ต่อ ผล ผลิต.

ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ຄວນ ຢູ່ ບ່ອນ ແລະ ຊ່ວຍ.
Don't look at me.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary are still doing that tomorrow.
I'd like to know how to drive a bus.
I don't want to be doing this.
It's just that Tom did it.
Tom said he had a chance.
That's what it's up to me.
มันไม่ใช่สิ่งที่ฉันสามารถตัดสินใจได้อย่างรวดเร็ว
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm sorry.
I know Tom knows that I'm not doing that.
Get out of it.
I know Tom's gonna be out of there.
But if I were you, I would've known the หมอ.
I've been working on it.
I've done everything I've said to do.
Did you get a tie that would be fine?

I thought I'd hear ບາງ ຄົນ ຮ້ອງ.
I've heard Tom's ວາງ ແຜນ to the ออสเตรเลีย.
It's not as hot as I can imagine.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I think I'm going to go up there.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I know Tom's been born toบอสตัน.
Tom, he's gonna get back to what he's saying.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom's got his own way of life.
I thought Tom was ປະຕິເສດ to do that.
You know, how did you know that he'd be the one who's been doing it for the rest of his life?
I'm supposed to be the one who's supposed to be in Boston.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm just glad you did.
I'm beginning to believe that he's gonna be able to convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said they ບໍ່ ຢາກอาศัยอยู่ในบอสตัน anymore.
Tom was never gonna be in danger of being ຄຸກ.
รถไฟของเขามาถึงที่สถานีหลัก 5.50 p.m.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ລໍ ຖ້າ ໄດ້.
Tom said that Mary thought that ໂຢຮັນ would be the only one to do it.
I know what to do.
We don't want to get the umbrella.
You know, Tom and Mary are not really happy when they're here when they're here.
Tom thinks I'm not doing that today.
Tom warned you that he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ເຮົາ ຂໍ ໃຫ້ ພະອົງ ເຮັດ.
It's a สงสาร that he wants to visit Tom when he's got a chance.
Tom told me that he was with him yesterday afternoon.
Tom and I find out who was supposed to be.
I'm เหนื่อย จน แทบ ไม่ สามารถ เดิน ได้.

I've been reading หลาย ພາສາ, but I need to tell you what to do.
You're an astronomer.
I'm supposed to use some เกลือ.
I know it's okay to say no.
ผมไม่ทราบว่าทอมและ Mary เคยแต่งงาน.
I think Tom's going to break.
Tom and Mary said he'd never do that.
I'm sorry, Tom.
I'm a skinny one.
I think Tom can get home by myself.
Both Tom and Mary know who you are.
Mary said she ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ວາງ ແຜນ to do it by itself.
It's supposed to be fun.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້pressed.
Tomยังไม่ได้ ບອກ ເຮົາ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ລາວ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
But I think you're gonna need to know that you're gonna be able to do it.
I was wondering if Tom's gonna have to tell me where he did that first.
ຖ້າ ເຈົ້າ ໄດ້ ຊ່ວຍ ຂ້ອຍ yesterday ບັນຫາ ກໍ ຈະ ຫຼີກ ລ່ຽງ ຈາກ ການ ເຮັດ ແນວ ນັ້ນ.

I knew Tom told Mary that he would do that.
Tom said they're gonna be out of bed.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ກໍາລັງ ຖືກ ປະຕິເສດ.
If Tom is left by 2:30, they're not going to go ahead.
Tom and Mary said he would do it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom's been ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ coming to Australia for more than 3 years.

I thought Tom was going to be hungry.
Tom thinks he's been a littleว่ายน้ําที่ดีที่สุดที่นี่.
I thought it was gonna take a snow tomorrow.

Tom said they thought it was dangerous to do that.
ช้า.
Tom's gonna do it if he's determined to do it.
But I know Tom would do that if he hadn't been.
ເຮົາ ຈະ ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ຮູ້.
Tom thought he was ฆ่า Mary.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่า หางของคุณไม่ได้ทํางาน?
He said that he was in the wrong place.
Tom and Mary thought that they could do that.
Tom's never gonna hurt us again.
I'm done with Esperanto.
What's wrong with you?

I think Tom's gonna be ຕື່ນ ເຕັ້ນ.
You're gonna be down in 15 minutes.
Tom said they're gonna take care of Mary.
ພໍ່ ແມ່ of Tom's let them do something they're not doing.
I thought she was gonna fix that.
I hope you're never going to do that.

He said he was unsure.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ว่า เขาไม่สามารถทําแบบนั้นได้
Tom was supposed to tell me.
I'm going to go to the toilet.
Both people are sorry for them.
What's wrong with you?
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ ຄິດ ເລີຍ ວ່າ ໂຢຮັນ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
He said that he must have done that.
I know what Tom thinks is why Mary's gonna do it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຊ່ວຍ ຂ້ອຍ.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to buy a house.
What do you think we're doing here?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເວົ້າ ພາສາ ຝຣັ່ງ.

Tom said Mary was unofficial.
I'm sorry.
I know that Tom ບໍ່ ຢ້ານ to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I were just going to work out.
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to do that because he wants to.
It's hot.
Tom told me that he ບໍ່ ຢາກอาศัยอยู่ในบอสตัน.
ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຖາມ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍชอบหรือไม่.
You're a young man. You're not going to be able to make a mistake.
Tom was hoping he'd be the one to blame for the ปัญหา.
I was just saying that Tom was interested in that.
Tom told me he'd ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ do that.
It's just a cat.
Tom thought Mary might also want to do that.
I'm ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ you're gonna do it.
Tom said he's been thinking of aสินบน.

It's just that I've lost it.
Tom said that Mary was probably a fussy.
You're bothผู้ใหญ่.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ອ່ອນແອ ຄື ກັບ ທີ່ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຄີຍ ເປັນ.
I knew Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I was supposed to be able to do that.
Don't tell me about the business when you're having a good time.
I don't think I'm gonna need to keep Tom doing that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was tough.
I hope Tom was under the ground with a ครอบครัวที่ดี.
Tom said he thought he knew Mary.
They're gonna be all right. They're gonna be all right.
I can't tell you, but I can't.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I wasใส่ aวิก.
It's like a drill.
Tom was supposed to do it for a long time ago.
I think Tom's been used to this afternoon.
I was wondering if Tom was going to go to the hospital.
Tom said that they know that they're still ບໍ່ ຍອມ ໃຫ້ ລາວ ເຮັດ ຢູ່ ໂຮງ ຮຽນ.
Tom said he's going to have to do that.
Tom's gonna do that to Mary if they're not going to be able to use more time.
The fact that you don't want to do is do it.
He's not gonna be able to do anything.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom could missปริศนาs.
I know Tom's got to be on his way toบอสตัน for him.
Tom said he wanted to be Mary to do that.
I think Tom can talk to Mary to do that.
You're the only one that Tom and Mary are gonna be in Boston until ตุลาคม?
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณไม่อยากทําแบบนั้นด้วยตัวเอง
Tom said they thought it was gonna be fun.
But I'm gonna go and find out if it's Tom's fault.
I think it's a little bit more interesting.
Did you know that if Tom and Mary were gonna do that?
What's that supposed to do with me?
You're gonna have to do that with Tom?
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຮູ້ສຶກ ປອດ ໄພ.
The sister's gonna be a star star star.
I knew when I said she was going to be there, but I'm not gonna be thinking about it.
I think he's going to cry.
You and I both know that it ບໍ່ true.
Let's assume that's gonna happen.
Tom said that he wanted to know what to do.
Tom didn't have a relationship with someone.
I'm not gonna hear about it.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was the only one who knew.
It's not like Tom's gonna come.
I thought Tom was going to go toบอสตัน this year.
Well, I think that's what they're trying to find out.
Shouldn't you be able to use your time?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ວາງ ແຜນ ຈະ ໄປ.
Tom said it seemed that Mary was having a hard time doing it.
I'm dealing with the Old English.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom said Mary's gonna do that.
I hope we're not going to go ahead.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was really ຍາກ to be with us.
He said that he was drunk.
Maybe we can tell from the past.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited.
I was wondering if Tom and Mary were สงสัย.
I knew Tom would never do that anymore.
Tom said they had a smile when it was จําเป็น.
I think Tom's too high.
Tom's got drunk and said he'd be able to say.
Tom said he thought Mary was very interested in theบาส.
Tom told me that they thought it was an interesting book.
Tom assumed that he'd always know that he would do that.
Tom said he's been planning on coming on the 20th.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said that they're just doing this.
A U.S.A.S. successsion has moved on between two and two.
That's why Tom's here for the first time in his life.
I'll do it if I've done it.
I thought Mary said she ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ວາງ ແຜນ to do that.
Tom assumes that he's always been in the middle of the night, who knows he's been in prison.
Tom had no idea that they knew how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he's seen Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said that they're not in theเงิน.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna be able to do that.
I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary to do that.
ทุกคนรู้ว่าทอมไม่สามารถพูดฝรั่งเศสได้ดี.
It's been a mistake to find out what it means to be able to do.
Tom's got a watch he's gone.
I need to know what aboutบอสตัน.
Tom said they thought it was dangerous to do that.
They're gonna have to open the window.
I know Tom's a perfect man.
I'm sorry, sir.
I know that Tom knows that Mary's about to do that.
Tom's just got to tell me that.
Tom said he's got a big deal.
Tom wants to know that Mary ບໍ່'s just fine.
Tom said they're gonna be able to do that for a while.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
- What's he doing?
รู้สึกยังไงบ้าง?
Fortune is a กล้า.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້ ອີກ.
I thought Tom was doing that.
So, I was wondering if Tom and Mary might have looked at me.
I thought Tom had heard of him.
It's not available.
- I hope we have to. - No, no, no, no.
Tom's สีing?
Tom and Mary ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຂໍ ໃຫ້ ເຈົ້າ ເຮັດ ດ້ວຍ ຕົວ ເອງ ບໍ ເພື່ອ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຊອກ ຫາ ຄົນ ອື່ນ ສໍາລັບ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ?
Tom said he'd walk down.
It's gonna be hard for Tom to win.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom told me he thought Mary was unpopular.
I was wondering if Tom knew they'd be up to the observance.
Tom said he wanted to know why Mary was going to be a ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom told me that he wasเหนื่อยed by an ສຶກສາ.
Where's theกระเป๋า?
Both of you are ดนตรีs.
I'm in Groningen.
ເຮົາ ຈະ ຮູ້ ໄດ້ ແນວ ໃດ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ ເລື່ອງ ຈິງ?
Tom said that he ບໍ່ ຢາກ ตาย.
นั่นคือรถที่ฉันต้องการซื้อ.
Tom said he thought that Mary was going to be all over the world to do so.
I know Tom's a cubby.
It's gonna be a dryer to the พรุ่งนี้?
I don't want Tom to be ເຕັມ ໃຈ ເວົ້າ ກັບ ຂ້ອຍ.
Tom said he's not the only reason for Mary to win.
I think you're gonna be able to get Tom to do that.
It's been raining.
I'm gonna tell you aภาษาอังกฤษ, and I'm gonna need aเยอรมัน.
Tom thinks he's gonna be fine.
But I think that's impossible.
I know it's not like we're gonna know about it.
Where's Tom?
Tom said Mary was going to be a parlor หย่าd.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈຶ່ງ ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ໄດ້ ເອົາ ຊະນະ ໄດ້.
I thought Tom was gonna be all right.
Tom, I'm both tired of playing Volleyball.
I mean, it's not like Tom's gonna be the one who's gonna be able to help him get away with it.
Tom said he was never gonna win.
Tom said he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he'd do it as soon as possible.
It could be that Tom would never be able to get to Boston with him.
มันไม่พอที่จะรู้เพียงภาษาเดียว
She's a blond girl.
Tom thinks he's gonna do that.
I know Tom's a game better than I am.
Tom said he's getting mad.
Tom may have done the same thing as Mary did.
I know that Tom is a sophomore.
Tom's also gonna know that they're supposed to be able to eat that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was aware of it.
But I thought she had the idea to be on her way up early.
Tom said that Mary was trying to get John to do it until Monday.
Tom was supposed to never be able to do that by myself.
What's the matter with you?
It's a sniff.
I'll let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was hard for them to believe.
I think he's a bad man.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ລໍ ຖ້າ.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was the only one to do it.
I thought it would be hot tomorrow.
You're the one who's been on the way around us?
Tom said that Mary was trying to find out how to do that again.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສາບານ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ບໍ່ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ອີກ.
- I don't know. - I don't think so.
I know that Tom would keep me from doing that.
Tom said that Mary would do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ've said that he ບໍ່ would do that.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna do that to จอห์น.
Tom said he thought that if Mary were not doing so, she would do it.
I don't think Tom can't be.
That's what Tom said.
Tom thought Mary might have done it today.
That's why we're putting theสมุดs away.
Tom and Mary said that he was ຮູ້ສຶກ.
I don't know what to do. I don't know.
I told you that I had ever been a child in Australia.
Tom said they knew what Mary was doing.
Tom said that they're not gonna have to ซื้อ something to Mary.
I know Tom's gonna come toบอสตัน, but I don't think he's gonna.
Tom said he thought Mary was over 30.
You're up by two floors to get the Parellers.
I don't think Tom's a good time.
Tom thinks he's gonna be too late.
I thought Tom wasป่วย.
I know what Tom wants to do.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ມີ ຄວາມ ສຸກ ເພາະ ໄດ້ ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ.
Tom and I are both willing to go.
I don't know what to say.
Tom and Mary said that they were ອິດສາ.
I thought I could do that to Tom.
Tom promised he'd never do anything wrong.
I mean, this is not the only reason why I'm here.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was an idiot.
Tom told me that he thought Mary might not be going to ออสเตรเลีย.
Don't sweat a little bit.
ฉันไม่คิดว่าจะมีใครช่วยฉันได้ตอนนี้
Tom said it was a bad thing to do.
Are you sure you're gonna do this?
It's just that I'm going to be tied up to this afternoon.
I know that you can hear me.
I think this may seem to be the one who's willing to do it.
Tom told Mary that he thought she was going to do something wrong ແຕ່ ລາວ ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ລາວ ຄິດ.
The หมอ ບໍ່ ມີ.
Hotballs are making a lot of money.
Tom's a good time.
ฉันสัญญาว่าจะไม่เกิดขึ้น
Tom said that Mary thought he was gonna do that.
Tom said he'd never be able to do that again.
I don't think it's done.
I'm sorry.
คุณไม่รู้ว่ามันยากแค่ไหนสําหรับทอม.
Tom gave up his own things to me.
I know that Tom is a full-older than Mary.
I was wondering if Tom could not do that.
I know that Tom can do that because he wants to.
Tom said that they'reโกหกing me.
Tom and Mary told ໂຢຮັນ that they're not gonna be able to get to believe him before he gets home.
Tom wanted to know if I had one of them.
เราไม่ค่อยแน่ใจเท่าไหร่ ว่าเราควรทํา ແບບ ໃດ.
You're both ຮັກ Tom.
Tom said he had no idea what to do.
I was so busy that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຄົນ ອື່ນ ຕ້ອງການ ເຮັດ.
Tom said Mary knew she might be left to do that.
ฉันไม่คิดว่าฉันรู้จักคนที่เล่นกลอง
You've got ตับ on your skin.
Tom and Mary, they'd never do that.
Give me theเทียน.
Tom ເບິ່ງ ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ ລາວ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ຫຍັງ.
It's good to explain.
Tom wants to know that they're gonna be out of here.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຢ້ານ.
Tom and Mary say that they findหมวกs.
I've graduated from Kyoto University.
You're just comparing apples andสีส้มs!
Tom said he had to work hard to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed.
Tom said he thought he was gonna be จับ.
Tom and Mary told me that they wereใส่ out.
I've been thinking about the girl who's a little girl in the world who's going to live in Australia.
Tom said they ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຫັນ Mary anymore.
They're going to live on the planet's fantasies.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said that they thought I was going to sleep.
I thought Tom was in the hospital.
I think you're gonna be able to do it.
I'm guessing Tom ບໍ່ dot it just as he's ever been.
I was so busy that Tom knew how to do that.
It's a big deal. It's a good idea.
I knew Tom would show me how to do it if he asked them.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was ຢ້ານ.
Tom told me that he's about to go to Boston for a year.
That's what it's like.
He said he's going to die.
Tom's decided to sniff out a little bit.
Do you still think Tom let me do that?
Tom wants to know that Mary wants to know what she's doing.
Tom said that he's got to do that.
I think Tom's a ภาษาฝรั่งเศส.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ວາງ ແຜນ ເພື່ອ ຈະ ໄປ.
He said he'd have ever been able to speak to ฝรั่งเศส.
I was สงสัย Tom and Mary were curious.
I know, Tom, and I know that I don't want to do that.
You're gonna need to talk to me about it.
Tom told me he's got aปวดหัว.
There's only a few minutes since it's aระเบิด.
Tom and Mary told me he'd win, but he ບໍ່.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary said he'd like to know a ฝรั่งเศส.
I don't think he's gonna find out what he's doing.
They're supposed to be the one that's supposed to be to go to Boston.
I thought he'd miss Tom's dated Mary.
Tom said it was the reason why Mary was supposed to do that.
Tom's got a car, and he's got to be Mary.
I'm a cat.
But I know that you do not do it anymore.
Tom said he wanted to be a man.
Tom's been talking about what he said is wrong.
Tom's probably been running out.
Who then said that she had made it to her?
I've been through.
I hope I've got a dress.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ ເຮົາ ຄວນ ເບິ່ງ ຕົວ ເອງ ວ່າ ການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ເປັນ ເລື່ອງ ຈິງ ຈັງ.
Tom said they're not going to be here if they're not.
I don't think I can do that.
Tom says he's gonna say that.
It's aวันอาทิตย์.
Tom told me that he's getting tired.
Well, I think that's what Tom's been doing.
ผมคิดว่าคุณรู้ว่าเราต้องทําวันนี้.
I think Tom's gonna do that.
I know Tom's gonna be out of bed.
Tom said he thought Mary had the idea of ฝรั่งเศส.
Tom said they didn't know what to do, so I was told.
I don't think they're going to get us home for a long time.
Tom said he was in the middle of the world.
Tom said he'd probably have a ຕັດສິນ ໃຈ place where he's gonna be.
ทุกคนรู้ว่าทอมไม่ชอบจะไปบอสตัน.
Tom said he thought it's gonna be a sunny ມື້.
Tom's a little drunk.
ฉันค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่านั่นจะไม่เกิดขึ้น
He's got to be at the wrong place, just like Tom.
I thought you had learned to give it to Tom.
I thought you said you saw Tom every morning.
I think Tom was supposed to go ahead.
Tom and Mary said that they've done all over the world.
I'd like to know that I'd like to know how to do it myself.
I don't think we're going to get out of here.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tom thinks Mary might also want to know that John's in French.
You know, I can't do that.
I think that's what happened to you.
I thought Tom would know what Mary was doing.
Tom was probably about thirteen-year-old.
Tom and Mary said that they were tickling.
Tom said he'd never be able to tell us what's going on.
I thought Tom would know why I was going to go up there.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who didn't do that.
I'm just ບໍ່ ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom ຈະ ຍອມ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom told me he thought Mary was meant.
So, what's the problem?
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary was a little sleeper.
They're gonna do it again.
I know Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ໃຜ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້.
Weg's got a choice.
I don't think it's a good idea.
Tom was told that he wanted to do it.
Here you go.
The Portraits เตือน me to the girl I know for a long time ago.
What's the third time you're feeling very sorry for?
ฉัน ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ทอม ບໍ່ เกลียด Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
I know Tom's been in love.
Well, I've been thinking about what happened to you.
The lake's a little bit less than the ญี่ปุ่น.
I know Tom's about to do that.
Tom and I need to talk to you about it.
I thought she'd be ready.
I know what Tom used to do.
I think Tom's the only one who's ever been thinking about it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເມື່ອຍ ຫຼາຍ.
What's wrong with you?
I think it's dangerous to tell you.
I thought he said he did it on Monday.
ทุกคนที่นี่รู้ว่า ทอม's inบอสตัน.
Tom ปฏิเสธ. He met Mary a week ago.
That's what I'm doing.
Austria is a parliament republic in mid-Europe, and it's nine of Bundislenders.
Tom and Mary areกําลังตามหาใครสักคน เพื่อ ຊ່ວຍ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ສ້າງกําแพง.
He said that he's probably 30 times.
I think Tom's not gonna do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was out of here.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that until ໂຢຮັນ did it for her.
Tom and Mary said that they were very happy.
Tom said that Mary thought John was gonna be one of them.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would never be able to do that.
I thought Mary wasน่ารัก.
Tom thinks Mary can do that by itself.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy.
Tom said they're gonna be a ออสเตรเลีย?
Tom said he'd be doing the same thing.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຢູ່ ນໍາ.
I'd like to be able to do the same thing.
Tom said Mary's safe.
Tom said I looked a little bit dryer than theครั้งสุดท้าย he saw me.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຫັນ ຂ້ອຍ พรุ่งนี้.
Tom said Mary was ກັງວົນ.
I'm ຢ້ານ ວ່າ Tom ຈະ ບໍ່ ຍອມ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ໄປ.
I think Tom knows what Mary's gonna do in the afternoon.
Tom, you're gonna have to do that.
I thought Tom was gonna be okay.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I was supposed to be going to Boston for you.
But he also said: “This is what the Son of man was able to do. ”
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be กลัว.
Tom and I are both trying to get away from you.
I knew that Tom would be the one to show Mary how to do it if she was asked them.
You can't pretend Tom's normal.
Tom's anused.
Tom should never be able to do that.
Tom and Mary said he'd never do that.
I'm up to them.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was incarcerated.
Tom said he thought Mary might not be able to do that on a cold day.
The ครู's room and theยิม are under the overgrading.
Does this mean that we're gonna be able to do it?
Tom, drop the glass.
I still thought it was gonna be late for Tom.
This is the first time I've ซื้อหนังสือพิมพ์ในเมือง.
That's a good question.
If it's because of the water, it's all right.
Tom เข้าใจแน่นอนว่า เราทั้งหมดต้องเข้าร่วมประชุมวันนี้
Tom and Mary say that he ບໍ່ ຍອມ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I know that Tom's gonna be all right.
I've had lunch three hours ago.
Tom said he'd like to know what's right with Mary.
I know that Tom's gonna be ອະໄພ to me.
I'm the only one who can do this.
Can we explain it to you?
Did you know Tom's gonna be inบอสตัน for a week?
Tom and Mary tell me that they're not in theหมา.
He knew that Tom and Mary were just like that.
I know Tom wants to know what to do.
Tom said he thought he might be able to do that by myself.
Tomมีหลายอย่างที่เขาต้องทํา.
Tom and Mary said that they wanted to ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ພ້ອມ.
There's nothing wrong with that.
I'm guessing Tom's been inexcriminated.
ผมหวังว่า ผมให้เงินคุณมากพอซื้อทุกอย่างที่คุณต้องการ
Tom said he'd like Mary to do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ທໍ້ ໃຈ.
ผมหวังว่าคุณจะไม่ได้เห็นผมทําแบบนั้น
Tom and Mary said that they need a lot of money.
I don't think I'm gonna tell Tom to do that.
Tom's supposed to never get the job.
Tom told Mary that she was one of them.
Tom knows he's not gonna be fired.
Tom was ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ວ່າ Mary ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
Tom said they knew that Mary was the one to do.
I think you're a Trrific.
I thought Tom was going to Boston for a week.
Tom said he wanted to know that Mary was not going to be from Australia until he was there.
I know that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ doing that.
You're going to be a fool.
I think Tom's not going to be able to win the war when he's making a binomic.
Tom said he'd like to know Mary ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເວົ້າฝรั่งเศสได้ดี.
Tom said that he knew Mary would win the race.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom said Mary ບໍ່โกรธ.
ฉันคิดว่าเราซื้อทุกอย่างที่เราต้องการ
Tom said he thought he could be able to do that by myself.
Tom's gonna ซ่อน something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom's on the other side.
We're just gonna do it to Tom.
Tom said that they knew that Mary was probably the one who had to do it by itself.
I don't think Tom knows how to use it.
It is not like a watch.
Tom and Mary said he was unofficial.
I am from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to live.
I know that you don't want to hurt me.
Tom's probably not willing to be able to ແກ້ໄຂ the ຜິດ ພາດ ຂອງ ລາວ.
I'm ຮັກing the book!
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ 'cause he couldn't do that.
Tom says he's not safe.
Tom's going to be home.
ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ບໍ ວ່າ ຈະ ເກີດ ຫຍັງ ຂຶ້ນ?
I think Tom believes me.
I think you can do that by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary might still be able to do that.
I thought he said he'd be able to do that anymore.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอม ไม่รู้จักใครที่ทําแบบนั้นได้
I'mค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่า Tom's got a แฟน.
But I thought she could be the only one who's gonna hear me.
I know Tom wants to know that Mary ບໍ່ did.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to do that.
That's theกีตาร์ I'm not buying.
I think Tom did it.
- Take this. - Good morning!
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ told me that they were ambidetrous.
I know that Tom wants to know that Mary ບໍ່ was the one who wanted to do it.
But I think Tom's gonna change his mind.
Tom's gonna be in the middle of the train, but we're not gonna be able to buy aช็อคโกแลต.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be excited about that.
I don't know what to do.
ບໍ່ ວ່າ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເວົ້າ ຫຍັງ ກໍ ຕາມ ຂ້ອຍ ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ໄດ້ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ເປັນ ຄົນ ທີ່ ສັດ ຊື່.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ໄດ້ ຮັບ ຄວາມ ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ.
ເຮົາ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ໃຫ້ ການ ປ່ຽນ ແປງ ໃນ ເວລາ ຂອງ ເຮົາ.
I was ຕົກໃຈ ເມື່ອ ໄດ້ ຍິນ ວ່າ Tom was being จับ.
Tom and Mary may be able to find out who really is supposed to be able to park it.
But I thought she could use a เพื่อน.
คุณจะไม่ฆ่าทอมจริงๆใช่มั้ย?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຕັມ ໃຈ ຊ່ວຍ ເຮົາ.
Tom told me he'd done that.
Tom's not one of them, but he's been 30 years old.
I don't think it's a good thing to do.
I'm guessing Tom ບໍ່ told Mary that she's not doing that thisวันนี้.
America's Civil's ສົງຄາມ has been 4 years.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ໂງ່ ແທ້ ໆ.
It will be easier for you to take care of the ชั่ว.
Tom said they're gonna พยายาม ບາງ ສິ່ງที่เขาไม่เคยทํามาก่อน.
I don't think Tom's got to be strong.
It's gonna be hard.
Tom said he said he wanted to be the one that's not going to come toบอสตัน for him.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary are สงสัย.
I'm an amplified.
Tom said they'll do it if they've done it.
I don't think they're gonna do that.
Tom said he didn'tจูบ Mary for good night.
But if you do, I will.
I think Tom's not gonna like it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຖືກ ລໍ້ ໃຈ ໃຫ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
I don't think I've got everything I've done.
That's what Tom ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ເຈົ້າ ເຮັດ.
That's a book that's given to Tom?
I've been thinking about Tom's been inบอสตัน last year.
Tom and Mary say that they're willing to do that.
I'm the one who said that Tom ຄາດ me to do that.
I was wondering if Tom had been toบอสตัน.
It's not going to work.
Tom said he felt sorry.
I know Tom's gonna do that by Mary.
ผมส่ง Mary โรสs.
Tom said that Mary was more than her.
I'd be as หิว as Tom.
You're gonna let me see?
I'll buy things I know that I'm not gonna be able to do.
Tom claims that he ບໍ່ ຂ້າ ຄົນ.
Tom and Mary said that they were ຂອບໃຈ.
ທຸກ ມື້ ນີ້ ເຈົ້າ ກໍາລັງ ເຮັດ ແນວ ໃດ?
Tom said Mary was not doing that yesterday.
Tom told me that he'd be able to do that.
I know that Tom's been up to a bit more than I am.
* (See footnote.)
I thought I might be able to do it.
I know that Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ ໃຫ້ ຂ້ອຍ ເຮັດ.
Tom wants to tell us something.
It's Tom's thirth birthday tomorrow.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ວ່າ Mary did what John said.
Tom and Mary said he was แคนาดา.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຫວັງ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ຊະນະ ໄດ້.
Tom said that he was just too good for Mary to do that.
ผม ຄວນ บอก คุณ ทุก อย่าง ก่อน.
I thought that's what you said.
I think you're supposed to ซื้อรถนั่น.
Tom told Mary that he was willing to do that.
I'm supposed to know Tom's gonna be ຫຍຸ້ງ.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
Tom said he's heard of a scoff.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna do that.
Tom thought I was the one who wanted to do it.
We don't know what to say.
I thought Tom did that yesterday.
Tom was allowed to be on the ground because he wanted to hold a documentary.
The thing is, it's okay.
Tom believes that Mary is trying to discredit them.
Tom, you know, he's not gonna want to hurt you.
Tom said he thought Mary might have been doing that.
I think Tom's gonna be all day ready.
Tom told me that Mary was nervous.
Samurai's alive by the code of the order.
I know Tom wants to know when I do that.
Tom said Mary was on his way down.
I don't believe Tom did it.
I don't think so.
Tom said he had something to do.
I should've been thinking about it before.
I think Tom's gonna be asking Mary to do that.
I thought Tom was not doing that.
Tom said he thought he was gonna have a ปัญหา.
It's been raining for three days.
Tom thought Mary was pregnant.
What happened when Tom did that?
Did you know that if Tom and Mary were allowed to do that?
เรา บอก ทุก คน ว่า เรา กําลัง จะ ย้าย ไป ออสเตรเลีย.
Please make sure that you're doing this พรุ่งนี้.
I think Tom's going to be a member of the world.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna be the only one.
They know Tom and I need to be like him.
I'm going to speak to him tomorrow.
He said that they were หิว.
Tom said he was supposed to do that.
Tom was cremked.
Tom said he thought Mary had done it by now.
Tom told me he thought he was able to do that.
I'm guessing Tom's gonna be in love with the ex-wifes.
It was Tom who used to know Mary was the one who had to do that.
Tom may not be able to wait for anyone.
I just assume that he's going to do that.
I need to know how much you want me to do it.
This is possible.
I think it's gonna be a lot of hard work.
I've been ຫຍຸ້ງ up all day long.
Tom said I should be able to do it by myself.
Tom said he didn't think he was able to do that.
Tom was the one who told me that I was not gonna do that.
I'd like to get home by 2:30.
Tom said he'd beหลับเมื่อคืน.
Tom told me he thought Mary was new.
ทอมอาจจะมาเมื่อวาน แต่เขาไม่ได้
I don't know what to do.
Tom thinks he's gonna be better than anyone else.
I thought Tom would do that by myself.
บางทีมันอาจจะดีกว่าถ้าฉันไม่ได้ทํามัน
So I guess Tom's still gonna do that.
You know, I'm fine with the light.
I've been busy as I was in the last year.
I can't tell Tom, but I'll just want to see him.
I thought she'd be unable to leave the city alone.
I don't think Tom's gonna be the one who's going to be.
Tom said they're gonna do that before they're done.
It's all right. It's just... it's been a lot of work.
Both Tom and Mary must have been born.
I know that Tom is the only one who knows that Mary would do that.
You're going to make it up for me.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom's a bit ເມື່ອຍ.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ the lawyer.
Tom and Mary said they're going to be by the ຝຶກ.
I don't know what Tom wants to do with me.
Tom said they're going to ask Mary to leave.
Tom and Mary are gonna sit down and sit down with a ຍ່າງ over the kitchen.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom's got it off.
This can be difficult.
Tom said he wanted to know what about Mary.
I thought Tom was gonna be a ออสเตรเลีย.
I'm so busy with Tom ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເຮັດ.
Tom's still gonna be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he was gonna be จับ.
I don't think Tom's got it.
I don't think Tom's doing it.
I thought Tom would.
I don't think Tom's gonna miss theเพลง he wrote about them.
I think I'll take the tie.
Tom thinks he's too important to do that by himself.
I know that Tom ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Mary's been working on it before.
Tomให้เงินฉันทั้งหมดที่ฉันขอ
Tom said that Mary knew John might not do that by myself.
The wood is sprouted in the water.
I think Tom's got it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said they've been uncovered.
Tom would do that, but Mary ບໍ່ would.
I don't think it's ปัญหา anymore.
Tom told me that he's not gonna do that tomorrow.
I thought it would be good to take care of the afternoon.
Tom told me that he'd still be able to do it by 2:30.
I'm an insomniac.
Tom said they're gonna ask Mary if she's not doing that.
I know how to use it.
Tom said Mary was aไว้ใจ.
Tom and Mary told me that they were ມ່ວນing the picnic.
I know that I'm supposed to do it, but I do it anyway.
I think Tom's the one that's drawing the key.
Tom's still thinking that Mary would be able to speak French.
He's just a little รักr.
Tom used to know Mary would do that?
Tom told me that they're ยุ่งing things.
Tom thinks it's gonna rain tomorrow.
I'd like to know that Tom's got a gun.
I think it's a chance that Tom's not gonna do it.
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to get aจักรยานเก่า.
I was wondering if Tom knew who would put it on the floor.
Tom was supposed to be guilty.
It's all right.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gonna beโกรธ.
คุณไม่ได้วางแผนจะช่วยทอม, right?
Tom, it ບໍ່'s จําเป็น to apologize.
I'm late.
Tom knows he's got a ปัญหา.
I'm a doctor, so I'm good to talk to you about it.
You will have to pay attention to the Bible.
You promised that you'd do that.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna be gone.
It's not going to be as hard as I thought it would be.
Tom wants to know that Mary ບໍ່ ມັກ of them.
You're 18?
Tom's not gonna leave ລູກ of him in his way.
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ສໍານຶກ ວ່າ ເຮົາ ຕ້ອງການ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said he thought he could have done that.
Tom said that Mary thought they might be able to do that by means of the time they wereเดินทาง.
Tom said he did that to Mary.
Tom said he wanted to think it was จําเป็น to do that.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ is the one who's not able to do it.
I'm afraid I can use my own time to get better.
ฉันหวังว่าทอมและ Mary คงไม่เร็วไปกว่าฉัน
Tom said he's not good at this.
Tom said he thought Mary would never be able to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited.
That's why it's dangerous.
Shouldn't we go anywhere else?
I think Tom's got to be strong.
Tom and Mary wanted to find out why they were supposed to be on their way off yesterday.
I thought Tom was going to be going to the wrong place.
Tom said he didn't have to.
I know Tom's a ป่า ranger.
It's gonna be hard for Tom to do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເວົ້າ ຫຍັງ ກັບ ເຈົ້າ.
French is the mother of theลิ้น.
I don't think Tom should do that.
Tom's been talking about the place and left.
I'm the only one who ບໍ່ ເຄີຍ ແຕ່ງ ດອງ.
Tom said they know how to do that again.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ແນວ ໃດ ໃນ ຕອນ ນີ້.
She's supposed to be a lawyer.
I'mค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่าทอมไม่รู้ว่าผมอยู่ที่นี่.
I don't think I'm gonna need a tie to theปาร์ตี้.
I don't think it's good for Tom to do that.
Tom said Mary was probably probably going to be pessimic.
I don't think I can do that, but I don't know what to do.
I think Tom might have said that Mary would do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a habit.
I don't think that's what I'm doing.
I'm ຢ້ານing tom ອາດ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ລາວ ຄວນ ເຮັດ.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ ຢາກ ໄປ to the concert.
Tom told me that he'd drive Mary to the airport.
Tom said they're driving toบอสตัน on Monday.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ told me that they're นอนy.
I know that you and Tom are gonna do that for you.
I think it's the first time Tom did that.
Tom was hoping he'd be punished.
I know that Tom is a very expensive man.
Tom's not going to be home by the same time.
I don't think I'm not gonna be doing it.
It's all right.
Tom could've been camping for him, but if you're not going to let him know that he's going to be.
I don't think Tom would like to know why Mary used to do that ເຖິງ ວ່າ ລາວ ບໍ່'d be asking for her.
Tom told me that they thought Mary might be very interested in doing that.
You're gonna be able to read the แผนที่s?
Tom said that Mary was going to make a lot of money.
I thought Tom would ever do that.
I think Tom might be a lawyerที่ดี.
I thought I could do that because of what he said.
You're pulling theขา.
I thought I said we'd never be able to do it myself.
I think we can do this by ourselves.
I know that Tom is the one who's gonna be the one to do it.
Tom said they're not giving a book to Mary.
I know what Tom wants to do.
Tom wanted to know that I was ญาติของ Mary.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said he ບໍ່ ຮູ້ຈັກ ພາສາ ຝຣັ່ງ.
I thought she could be out of here.
I thought Tom was about to tell Mary how to do that.
I thought she was not a dancer.
I don't think I'm gonna be a businessman.
Tom said the party was over.
Take it as if it's going to rain.
Tom said that I might not be able to do that by myself.
Savity is not detaining.
Tom ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ສະເຫນີ ທີ່ ຈະ ຊ່ວຍ.
I think Tom's gonna be true.
So I assume Tom told me that I was going to go on.
You know, I'm gonna be the one who's gonna be out there?
She's a despicable มนุษย์.
Tom's planning to do that.
Take off the company's company.
So I'm guessing Tom's got to know Mary would do that.
It's just that I don't like it.
I know that Tom is almost as tall as he is.
The first time I met Tom, he was only 13 years old.
Tom said ออสเตรเลีย was going to be a ประเทศโปรด.
I've been wondering if Tom's ever been doing that.
But I thought he was gonna be able to get out of here.
What's wrong with you?
No, I'm not.
Tom was planning on doing that today.
I'm not exactly the same as I am.
Tom and Mary said ນີ້จะเป็นครั้งสุดท้ายที่พวกเขาพยายามทําแบบนั้น
Can you tell me who's going to be in the morning?
Tom said he didn't think he'd let Mary have aดอกไม้.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ມີพยาน.
ทอม สามารถ ເຮັດ ໃນ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ລາວ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
ข้ารู้ว่าเจ้าไม่ชอบออสเตรเลีย
I don't want to see anything.
Doesn't mean that you're never gonna tell me.
Tom's gonna want to know what I'm doing.
I think he's gonna be fine as he said he's coming.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary to do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າโดดเดี่ยว.
When's it come to you?
Tom said he'd be fine.
Tom told me that he wanted to know how to speak to ฝรั่งเศส.
I'm so busy that he wants to know that Tom's going to be in the hospital.
Tom said he wanted to know where Mary worked.
So I guess we're just gonna be able to prove that.
I'm so busy that he wants to know what Tom wants to say toฝรั่งเศส.
Tom was so busy that ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຢູ່ ຫັ້ນ.
I'm sorry.
He's done nothing wrong with theเกม of the city.
Tom thinks it's gonna be a joke to bring an egg on theเก้าอี้ Mary's.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຮູ້ສຶກร้อน.
This is the first time I've ever been eaten by a Pizzeria.
Tom said he'd be able to get theสระ on this afternoon.
Tom said he'd like to do that.
I thought he said no matter what happens.
Tom thinks Mary's pushy.
I'm skint.
What are some things that are possible for us?
Tom's drinking more than Mary did.
Tom said he assumed that Mary was not gonna do that.
One ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ຕ່າງ ໆ ໃນ ເວລາ ດຽວ ກັນ.
ผมจําไม่ได้ชื่อเธอ.
Some do.
Tom and Mary said that they really want to be.
I'll keep you in order for aพาย.
I thought I was going to say a word.
It is a ສິດທິ ພິເສດ that we may not be able to do so.
Tom ເບິ່ງ ຄື ວ່າ Mary told us that she was gonna do that.
Tom said he thought he was able to tell you this morning.
I've been used to be late.
I thought Tom seemed to be happy.
Tom said Mary was supposed to do that.
It doesn't seem like it.
Tom said that they know how to do it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
It's been a matter of Monday.
Tom said they're not gonna find people to do that to them.
I think Tom's supposed to be on his way too.
I know that Tom and Mary are going to beหย่าd.
Tom's still on his way.
I know Tom wants to know that he's supposed to be doing it.
I know that Tom's gonna be doing it in Australia a month ago.
Tom ບໍ່ ມີ ເຫດຜົນ ທີ່ ຈະ ບໍ່ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Mary told me that she thought Tom wasหล่อing.
I'm trying to find out what you're going to say.
I think both Tom and Mary are not going to be able to eat.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
It's just that I've got a bad time.
I think Tom ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ເຈົ້າ ເຮັດ.
Tom said that I should be the one who should tell Mary that she ບໍ່ was supposed to do it.
Tom and Mary said that he's about to be.
I know Tom's supposed to be doing itข้างนอก.
I thought I was supposed to be able to do it.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary know what's going on.
I'm the only one who knows where to be.
Tom told me he thought Mary wasเกษียณ.
What's the name?
Tom told me he thought Mary had left.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ຄິດ Mary's gonna do that.
I know Tom knows that Mary's not gonna do it anymore.
You're a กล้าer than me.
Tom said they're getting drowsy.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ພະຍາຍາມ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ເລີຍ.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna be a ออสเตรเลีย for three weeks.
I'm supposed to tell Tom how to believe what Mary said.
It's gonna be interesting to do that.
But if you ever tell me, I'm gonna be ໃສ່ with you.
I think Tom is ຢ້ານing.
Tom said they're ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ວ່າ Mary'sว่ายน้ํา.
What's wrong with her?
I think Tom's going to have to move on.
ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ສົນ ໃຈ ໃນ ເລື່ອງ ນີ້.
I thought theตํารวจ knew Tom.
What's up, man?
Tom has nothing to do with him.
He's looking at the sculpture of the unsub, and I'm looking at the man who's in love.
I think I can do that better than I do.
All right, let me know that you're gonna be late.
Tom's adreast.
Will ເຕັມ ໃຈ ສະເຫມີ ທີ່ ຈະ ແກ້ໄຂ to be a sign of ສະຕິ ປັນຍາ.
Tom would never do that.
I don't think we're going to do that.
It's not as sweet as it was yesterday.
If I knew how to do it, I would do it myself.
Tom's cleared up the bikes.
คุณไม่ได้วางแผนที่จะถ่ายรูป, right?
They're two years old than I am.
Tom and Mary told me that they were sorry.
I'd like to know that Tom was gonna be doing that anymore.
I thought he said he'd seen people do that.
I mean, it's not like Tom's gonna be a good guy.
He wants to see TV.
Tom said he's reluctant to do that to him.
Give it back!
Tom said he thought Mary might have ຊ່ວຍ ເຫຼືອ to you this morning.
I thought the concert was a little cold.
You're gonna have to eat it.
I thought Tom had come to know what to do.
ผมเกรงว่าแผนของคุณจะไม่ทํางาน
I don't think anyone can see me do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might be able to win.
So I thought Tom had a word.
ทุกคน, except Tom, it seems to be fun.
Tom said they're not going to get a lot of money, so they're gonna have to ซื้อ อะไรกิน.
Tom ບໍ່ประหลาดใจที่ Mary did that.
I knew Tom was doing it.
ฉันไม่แน่ใจว่ามันเป็นไปได้
I don't think Tom's ຕ້ອງການ going to be a ออสเตรเลีย for me.
I thought Tom was going to be โรง เรียน.
I knew Tom would be the one to do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ດີ ໃຈ ຫຼາຍ ທີ່ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
He said he's gonna ซื้อ that for him.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ມີ ເງິນ.
Tom is not willing to go by itself.
I know Tom ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ ຫຍັງ ກັບ ເຮົາ.
They're the only ones who're willing to talk about it.
Tom's out of the showers andใส่เสื้อผ้าs.
I don't think Tom's about to be on his way.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ທໍ້ ໃຈ ຫຼາຍ ຈົນ ຢາກ ຕາຍ.
I'm guessing you're gonna be gonna be a big deal with Tom.
Tom thinks I'm gonna be the one who's gonna do it by myself.
I don't think that's what I know.
I don't think Tom did what he said.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I don't think it's gonna be hard for Tom to do that.
Tom said he wanted to know where Mary was not going.
Tom and Mary both became a ออสเตรเลีย when they wereเด็กๆ.
Tom didn't even think that he was supposed to do that.
It's gonna be fine for anyone.
Tom said he's always going to be there.
Dom Tom and Mary know what they're doing here?
I know I've been stupid.
Tom and Mary are both full of years of age.
I know that Tom and Tom are all gonna do that.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna do that.
I've been thinking about Tom and Mary that you don't need to be like me.
I thought I could do that.
Tom thinks he's not doing that.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to visit ออสเตรเลีย.
She's eating.
They're the รัก of their lives.
I think Tom's a little painter.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing for dinner.
It's hard to find aรองเท้า that'sพอดี.
I'd never let Tom do that.
I've promised Tom that I've been going to ออสเตรเลีย for them.
Tomร้องเพลงs out of here.
Tom said he's got a day.
Does this mean that you're going to drink?
Tom and Mary must have had the hope that they would win.
Tom knows that he can win.
I don't think I can do that.
I am going to blame you.
I thought I said the car wasขโมย.
I don't know what to do.
Both Tom and Mary would beอยู่ในออสเตรเลีย ເມື່ອ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເປັນ ລູກ.
If Tom ບໍ່ did it, then I'm also going to do it.
Tom told me he thought Mary wasตลก.
I know Tom wants to know that Mary's supposed to be doing that.
I was wondering if Tom could have been in Boston in the summer.
In fact, Tom said that he would never be able to speak to others about God’s Kingdom.
They're probably getting out of here.
Tom's gonna be fine.
I thought Tom was gonna give her aดอกไม้.
Tom said that Mary thought John was gonna be one of the most important things in his life.
I think he's got enough food to feed him.
I should've listened to her when she said.
Tom's going to be full of time.
I think Tom's been extremisting.
I'm ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ຄວນ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom said Mary was probably going to ตื่น.
If it's crazy, it's a way out of it.
Tom told me everything I needed to know.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ told ທຸກ ຄົນ that they were going to do the same.
Tom said he'd do it until I told him.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was going to be honest.
She's gonna know about that.
I don't think I've heard Tom บ่น about Mary's cooking.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary are on their way to do that.
What's up?
I don't think we're gonna be able to do it.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Tom was ຫຍຸ້ງ up.
Tom said they thought I might be able to do it until ตุลาคม.
What's going on, Tom?
Tom's a salesman.
I've been thinking that Tom's not gonna be inบอสตัน anymore.
Tom was convinced that they were not doing that.
This is the first time I've been visiting ออสเตรเลีย.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่รู้ว่า เขาไม่จําเป็นต้องทําแบบนั้น
ทุกคนรู้ว่า เราฆ่าทอม.
Tom says he's not gonna be here with us.
Dinnerยังไม่พร้อม.
I hope you're gonna be able to keep up with me tomorrow.
ແນ່ນອນ ວ່າ ເຮົາ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ໄດ້ ແຕ່ ກໍ ເປັນ ເລື່ອງ ຍາກ ທີ່ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
ผมอาจช่วยชีวิตทอม.
That's a good idea. Tom's gonna be asking Mary to make a big deal.
Tom told me that he did not find a book that's going to be done on a cell phone.
I think we can look after ourselves.
Are you okay?
I thought I made the reason to take care of it.
Tom, I'm the one who's looking up.
Tom said he's sorry that he'sหักing a man.
I think I've got enough of the money to ซื้อคอมพิวเตอร์ that I don't.
I knew that Tom was trying to do that.
I'm so glad I'm on my way.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said he's เย็น.
I know, Tom, I know, I don't want to do it.
Tom's only been doing what he was supposed to do in the first week.
Tom said he wanted to get the sculpture.
I know Tom's a little bit more than Mary.
Tom said he thought that he knew what Mary had planned to do.
Tom and Mary said he'd be able to win, and he did.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom thinks Mary wants to be cold.
Tom told me that they thought Mary would be going to be a ออสเตรเลีย.
I thought Tom would be happy about that.
I know that Tom would allow you to do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought John was ancient.
Tom's going toบอสตัน when he's done.
I know that Tom was never thinking of doing it.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่าฉันหวังว่า Tom would do that?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said he's going to speak to him later.
But I'm sure you're gonna listen to what you're saying.
I can see that you are not alone.
No, it's not. It's like a joke.
I thought they were gonna do it.
Tom told me that he'd be able to do that today.
The fuse has been paid.
Tom and Mary ไม่สามารถ ຊ່ວຍ ຂ້ອຍ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
Tom should've been aware of it.
I thought Tom didn't make me do that.
It's fine to เยาะ เย้ย the man in theสาธารณะ.
เรา ຄວນ วาง แผน ไว้ สําหรับ เรื่อง นี้.
I don't think you want to tell Tom how he's doing it.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom and Mary said that they would be able to do that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom says that they're not gonna be able to make up for themselves a few weeks in the ออสเตรเลีย.
- Let's go to the house. - Let's go.
Get the fuck out of here!
I think Tom's been toบอสตัน, at least one time.
He's gone to Tokyo tomorrow.
I'll be fine if I don't know what to do.
Tom said Mary was going to be a ออสเตรเลีย.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ສຶກສາ ตอน เช้า.
You'reหลอกing me!
I'm going to be fine with that, Tom.
- Is that a seat? - Yes.
Tom said he didn't believe he told Mary that he was willing to do that.
You're ອິດ ສະຫຼະ.
I know that Tom is a believer.
Tom thinks it's gonna be fine.
Tom said he and Mary had a big fight today.
Tom's about to beโกหก.
I heard Tom's going to be a ออสเตรเลีย.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom could have seen the ເງິນ.
Tom was สงสัย ว่า Mary would have made a สัญญา.
Make sure they're not going to get us.
I can't believe it's gonna change.
Tom said that he's getting bored.
ເຫັນ ໄດ້ ແຈ້ງ ວ່າ Tom's gonna do that by Mary.
I'm guessing Tom's been drunk.
I've been พบ by the people yesterday who knew that you were.
Tom told me he's got a insurance.
I'm afraid I'll be right back in there.
The meaning of the whole thing is being taken up to the enblack of advocation.
Tom says that they do not have to do that.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary know what's going on in the matter.
You know, I'm the one who's got to do it, right?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງ ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ເປັນ ໃຜ.
I think I've been through the test.
I know Tom's a loser.
I don't think Tom's dead.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຮູ້ສຶກ ສິ່ງ ໃດ ເລີຍ.

It's a good thing to do.

Tom said he didn't find Mary to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary was having fun.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was gonna be like John.

That's how it works.

I'm a horrific.
Tom told me that they're หิวin' when they're home.
Tom said that Mary may not be able to understand why it is important to do it.

I thought Tom'd be able to remember me.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ກໍາລັງ ເຮັດ ວຽກ ຫນັກ ຫຼາຍ.
I don't think Tom would like to know if Mary's not even looking for him or not.
I don't think I'll be moved toบอสตัน until now.
They're the only ones who can do this is Tom.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເປັນ ຢ່າງ ດີ.

Theปัจจุบัน I've been with Tom is one of the most important.
I think I've got enough money.
Tom, it's the same thing as if he and I were being told.
ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ ໄດ້ ແນວ ໃດ ວ່າ Tom's about to do that?
Can you just leave me aปากกา?
Let's see if we can get out of here.
I've been working on it, and I've been working on it.
Tom was remorseed by the man.
Tom said Mary was probably gonna have to be.
What's the stupidest thing you've ever done?
Tom and Mary ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ບອກ ใคร ๆ ว่า ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ're willing to do the lottery.

I don't want to be like you.

I know what Tom wants to do.

I thought Tom would do that.
If I'm taking the place, then it's not gonna be too much.
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to save a movie.
I'm just saying that you're the one who's gonna be able to make peace with me.
I know that Tom is about to bear a weight as I am.
Tom said he wanted to know what the ປະຊຸມ wasโพสต์.
Shouldn't you be able to take a look at him?
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ມັກ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ.
It was not easy for them to do so.

ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເວົ້າ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເບິ່ງ ແຍງ ຊາດ ອິດສະລາແອນ.
I don't think I'm gonna be.
ฉันรู้ว่าทอมไม่สามารถทําแบบนั้นได้ ເຖິງ ວ່າ ລາວ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ໄດ້.
You've done it by yourself.
I thought maybe she had the idea.
Tom and Mary said that they were ຫົວໃຈ.
I thought Tom was going to the house.
I know, Tom, I know that I'm supposed to be able to do that.
You're both Tom and I have to do that.
Don't tell me what you're talking about.
I'm done with เรเดียน.
Tom's right, and he's deported.
I don't know what to do with this.
Tom says he's ວາງ ແຜນ to our heavenly Father as long as he can.
I don't think we can do this.

I thought Tom was ບໍ່แปลกใจ.
I thought he said he was gonna beร้องเพลง.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ said that they're going to do itเร็วๆ นี้.
I know that the most important thing to do is to protect me.
I don't believe you're not doing that.
I got the idea that Tom was doing well.
Tom wants to know that Mary's old man's.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເຈັບ ປ່ວຍ ຫນັກ ຫຼາຍ ຈົນ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຈັບ ປ່ວຍ.

It is not until it comes to the end of this system of things.

I don't know what to do with this.

It's been 30 years since I was born.
Tom told me he hated to do that.
Tom said he thought I was dead.
Tom said, "I don't want to do that."
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຈະ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ທີ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ສໍາລັບ ພວກ ເຮົາ.

I'm just trying to get rid of this.
Tom said he wanted to อนุญาตให้คุณทํา.
Tom and Mary said that they ບໍ່ ຢາກ ເວົ້າ.

ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ພະຍາຍາມ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.

Tom said he'd do something illegal.
Tom told me that he's going to be a good man.
He's not going to be able to do anything wrong.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าทอมอยู่ในหอพัก
But I thought she was not gonna see it.
Tom told me that he'd be able to focus on theทีม.
I hope Tom's not gonna be the one who's gonna be able to help him.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ອາດ ຈະ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ.
Tom and Mary told me that they were free.
Tom said Mary was probably going to be one of them.
Tom can't do that ເຖິງ ວ່າ ລາວ ຕ້ອງການ.
Boston ບໍ່ ແມ່ນ to be like Chicago.
I'm supposed to tell Tom that he's supposed to be to go to Boston.
I think the เพื่อนบ้านs are still dead.
I think Tom might have done that.
I don't think Tom's gonna be too late until he's done the same thing.
Tom's cooking.
Tom said he thought Mary was gonna be cold.

I don't know.

ฉันไม่คิดว่าฉันรู้จักผู้ชายคนนั้น
Tom said he's been planning on coming on Monday.
I'm afraid I'm gonna be late.
I've got aหมวก on it.
ทอม ຢ້ານ ວ່າ ພໍ່ ແມ່ ຂອງ ລາວ ຈະ ເລີ່ມ ຖາມ ລາວ ກ່ຽວ ກັບ ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ ແລະ ພະອົງ ຈະ ບໍ່ ບອກ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ກ່ຽວ ກັບ ທຸກ ສິ່ງ.
She said that if she knew what to do, she would never do it.
Tom thinks he's going to be doing it tomorrow.
They know Tom's beenโกหก.
Tom's still looking at it.
Tom might be aทรยศ.
I know Tom can't stand by to do that.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງ ມາ ຮອດ ບ້ານ ເກີດ ໃນ ເວລາ ນັ້ນ.
Tom told me that they're gonna talk to Mary about that.
I thought he was gonna be able to tell us how.
I don't think Tom knows what the size of Mary is.
She's gonna do it if it doesn't really sound like that.
Get the hell out of here!
She's the first one of them.
In summer, theไข่'s gonna be fine.
I've been สอน สุนัขs to sit up and see.
I'm sure you're not going to tell me where you're going.
Tom thinks he's supposed to be.
Tom, it's not as simple as I am.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
ฉันนึกว่าคุณเป็นเพื่อนทอมซะอีก
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຮູ້ສຶກ ເຫງົາ.
I think I'm unlucky.
Tom said he was gonna do that.
Tom should've been allowed to go where he was.
Tom thought Mary would never ສອນ ฝรั่งเศส.
Tom told me he's been fine.
Tom said he'd be disappointed.
Tom said he didn't think he was convinced Mary would do that.
Tom said that Mary knew that ໂຢຮັນ might be doing that by myself.
Have you ever been trapped in the elevator?
Tom says he's trying to be a part of the context.
Tom said he didn't believe he could do that again.
This is not enough to do so.
Tom said he ບໍ່ meant to hit me.
You can't believe that you're going to have a good time.
I'm going to see if Tom's in the สํานักงาน.
Tom and Mary said that they're not going to be red wine.
Tom and Mary said that they ອາດ ບໍ່ ຈໍາເປັນ ຕ້ອງ ເຮັດ.
ฉันหวังว่าคุณจะรู้ ว่าสิ่งสุดท้ายที่ผมอยากทํา คือทําร้ายคุณ
I'm going to be better than me.
I thought Tom was gonna be okay.
So, since the สามี are about 20 klograms andกางเกงs, they're at the same time.
Tom, he's never gonna be able to do anything about it.
Tom's gonna be able to stay alive any longer than they've ever been.
I still don't think so.
Tom said they thought they'd be able to do that on the 20th.
All I know is that it's the least we can do is know.
Tom assumes that he's always been in the middle of the night, who knows he's been in prison.
Tom said Mary ບໍ່ thought John would do that toอลิซ.
ບໍ່ ມີ ໃຜ ຫມັ້ນ ໃຈ ໄດ້ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ສິ່ງ ຕ່າງ ໆ ໄດ້ ໂດຍ ທີ່ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຊ່ວຍ ເຈົ້າ.
ฉันหวังว่าฉันคงไม่ต้องโยนมันทิ้ง
I know Tom wants to know that Mary's gonna be doing that.
Do you think Tom's not gonna hang out with him in the light of the year?
Are you still saying I'm gonna be talking to you?
I think Tom asked to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was aเก่ง.
But I think you know Tom's gonna be too busy.
Tom said they're not doing this on 14: 20th.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy to be a ออสเตรเลีย.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom, you look older than he does.
Tom told me he thought Mary was grateful.
I've got a load of work to do before I'm home.
ทั้งหมดที่เราสามารถทําได้ตอนนี้ คือหวังว่าทอม ເຮັດ ຕາມสิ่งที่เขาสัญญาจะทํา
I've never read it.
I don't think Tom does it anymore.
I thought you were ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ເວົ້າ ເລື່ອງ ນີ້.
He's got a vegetableพรม in the living.
Tom said that ທຸກ ຄົນ he knew nothing to do with it.
You're the ones who're the ones who're making up for you.
คุณไม่รู้เหรอว่าทอมเคยแต่งงานกับ Mary?
Tom said he's not gonna do that.
Tom and Maryสาบานว่า ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເຮັດ.
I know what Tom wants to do.
Tom's got to go ahead.
Tom's got a better idea.
The ตํารวจ's still out there who Tom was murdered.
I guess Tom's gonna be a little crazy.
I know Tom used to be sitting on the ground.
I've been สร้าง ເວັບ ໄຊ jw.orgs.
Tom said Mary was driving.
เราพยายามปิดกล่อง.
I know that Tom's gonna be on it.
Tom said he might have done something like that.
I think Tom's over 30.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าคุณวางแผนจะทําเช่นนั้นเร็ว ๆ นี้
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I thought she said she hated doing that.
Tom told me that he's going to be anผู้เชี่ยวชาญ.
I know that Tom can't find Mary to do that.
Christmas is just around the corner.
Tom may not have been able to do that.
Tom's the smartest thing I've ever met.
ชายคนหนึ่งโทรมาหาคุณเมื่อคืน.
I'm a bit drunk.
He's not as bad as he looks.
So I guess this is going to be a step over the other side.
I'm gonna keep ແນ່ ໃຈ ວ່າ Tom did that for a while.
Tom fell in love with Mary, who was the first time he saw her.
I've got a lot of idea what I've said.
Shouldn't you be left while you've got a chance?
I thought you said you had aหมา.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tom said he was going to come toบอสตัน if he were not.
That's not gonna change anything.
Tom's going to mean it.
ເຮົາ ບໍ່ ຮູ້ ວ່າ Tom's gonna do that.
I'm trying to find out what you're going to do.
Hi, man!
I don't think we're gonna have to do it.
Tom's not gonna believe that he's been out of here on a great day.
You're gonna do a lot of bricks because you want to get used to it.
It's just that I've been playing tennis as I've ever had.
Tom said that Mary may not be able to get out of here.
Tom and Mary say that he's willing to win.
I said, Tom, if they're the ones who've ever been told to ฝรั่งเศส.
I'm getting bored out of my mind.
Tom was supposed to do what Mary told us to do.
Tom is the only one who's going to be a good man.
I knew that Tom told Mary that he would be able to see him again.
Tom and Mary said that they're not gonna have to come up with you this time.
I'll be able to get home if it's too good to go.
If I had done nothing better, I could have done it.
It is easy to understand that both Tom and Mary have done it.
Tom can't do that if he says he's gone.
I know Tom's aฉลาดer than Mary was.
What's wrong with you?
I hope you'll do it.
I mean, it's time to tell me that I'm not disfellowshipped.
I don't think they're satisfied.
I don't think they're going to need a copy of the book.
I know Tom wants to know that he's the one who's been doing that.
I don't think Tom's got a good time to talk to him.
I think you're supposed to do it by yourself.
They're the ones who've been doing all of this.
ฉันหวังว่านายจะเป็นเพื่อนฉัน
Tom says they're not going to be able to get a unicycle.
I thought you could know what Tom was going to be out of bed.
Tom assumed that he'd always know where he'd be in the middle of the prison.
Tell me, เพื่อนของคุณเป็นใคร, and I'm going to tell you who you are.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ກັງວົນ ຫຼາຍ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ຂ້ອຍ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າหิว.
It's gonna be done by the way it's done.
Tom might still be in the middle of the night.
Tom said he thought he'd never be able to find a job.
I think that's the only thing that's going on in the fluteles.
I think Tom's ยุ่งing this morning.
Tom said he assumed that Mary would be crying.
I'm going to make it up to the 20th.
I don't think it's like Tom's not gonna be able to see you.
Tom's got to cry.
Tom's been over to the two of you.
Tom said they'd do that on their own.
I สงสัย ວ່າ ຖ້າ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ມັນ ຈະ ຍາກ.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom's working out.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ told ທຸກ ຄົນ that they were สงสัย.
I know you can't be sure you're gonna be able to help me.
ຂ້ອຍ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ສາມາດ ເຮັດ ເຊັ່ນ ນັ້ນ ໄດ້ ເຖິງ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ພະຍາຍາມ ເຂົ້າ ຮ່ວມ ການ ປະຊຸມ ໃຫຍ່.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to move this book out of my mind.
Tom said he thought Mary was having a good time in the ออสเตรเลีย.
I know Tom's a fan hockey.
Tom said that they knew what Mary was not doing.
I don't think Tom knows I think he's stupid.
ฉันหวังว่าทอมกับฉันจะไม่มารบกวนคุณ
Tom told me that he thought Mary was a ฝรั่งเศส.
Tom said they're not gonna be careful.
I thought you and Tom wereไม่ชอบกัน.
คุณควรบอกทอม how he's planning to beว่ายน้ํา.
Tom assumed that he'd always know that Mary would understand ฝรั่งเศส.
Did Tom really think I ເຊື່ອ that?
I'm not gonna be able to do this.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບອກ ວ່າ ຈະ ບໍ່ ມີ ທາງ ເລີຍ.
ฉันไม่รู้ว่าทอมจะทําแบบนั้นเองได้
Tom's a little too late.
The road is ขนานed by the แม่น้ํา.
I'm guessing Tom and Mary know that something's going to be fine.
Tom told Mary that they're not gonna do that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tom said that he was the type of person to do that.
ฉันไม่แน่ใจว่าฉันพร้อมสําหรับเรื่องนี้
Tom's on the picture, too.
Tom says he wants to know what Mary wants to do.
Tom said he might be able to win.
I think Tom and Mary are on their way to this.
That's not a good idea.
Tom told me that he thought Mary had been playing the cello.
I know, Tom, and I know that I'm supposed to be doing it.
Tom looked back when Mary said that.
Tom said he ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ຄິດ Mary should do that again.
Tom said he didn't know if I wasว่ายน้ํา.
"Is it true?" "I think so!"
I don't want to do anything about it.
Tom said Mary was ບໍ່ pessimic.
I'm not asking for a crime.
I don't know.
I know Tom wants to know what to do.
Tom told me that I was supposed to be able to do that.
I'm ຢ້ານ ວ່າฉันไม่สามารถช่วยคุณได้
I know. I'm the only one who's ever been married.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ບໍ່ ໄດ້ ເປັນ ຄື ກັບ ວ່າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ເບິ່ງ.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I think Tom's not gonna have to do that.
Tom said Mary was probably in a ຫົວໃຈ.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ອາດ ເຮັດ ແບບ ນັ້ນ ຖ້າ ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງການ.
I know Tom's a little shyer.
Tom knew I was going to be.
That's all I got.
Tom ບໍ່ ຕ້ອງການ ໃຫ້ ຄົນ ອື່ນ ຮູ້ ວ່າ they're going to ออสเตรเลีย.
Tom said he'd like to think that Mary was gonna be all day late.
But I've promised you that I'd be too late.
I knew that Tom was going to do that by myself.
Tom said he thought that if Mary were not doing that, she would be able to do it.
You can do that for yourself.
I'd like to know if the อากาศ could hold.
It's gonna be aโรแมนติค to do that.
I know Tom's a little bit more than I am.
สําหรับที่นี่, please.
Tom said that they thought it would be dangerous to Mary to walk home by the night.
Did you know Tom was gonna do that by Mary?
Tom said that he's not gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's going to be.
I know that Tom can beว่ายน้ํา better than I can.
Tom and Mary told me that they're gonna be.
Tom's got sniffed out of the tithe that Mary gave us.
Good work, man.
ເຂົາ ເຈົ້າ ຕ້ອງ ຮູ້ ວ່າ ຂ້ອຍ ບໍ່ ນັບຖື ພະ ເຢໂຫ ວາ.
What do you want to do?
Tom's a big-header.
I don't think I'm supposed to tell Tom that I'm going toบอสตัน.
เขาชอบเล่นฟุตบอล.
I know Tom wants to know that Mary would do that.
