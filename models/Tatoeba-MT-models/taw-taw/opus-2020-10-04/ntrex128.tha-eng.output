Well's membership was very worried about 'cause being looked like a joke.'
Some even have been offered to rename their position as a MWPs.
This is due to the plan to rename from SMachcha as the Parliament of Wells.
A member of the SMchasha, who is a politician, is worried that this might lead to a scorpion.
One member of the SMCHCHA laborer said that his group was worried, "This name is going to fit in with the word "Twp and Pwp."
For readers out of Wales: In Wales, Twp means stupid and pwp means something that's analogy.
A member of the Smish Plad, one said, "I don't like it," and there was another choice.
And the Wellsists said that his group was wide open about this change of change, but I thought this was just a short change from the MWP to Muppet.
In this context, a letter w in Wales has a sound like U in Yorkshire's English.
The SMSCHA, which is now making the law of this change, says, "The final decision in which the final part of the description of any maschasha member is certainly affected by any member."
According to the Wells government law, 2017 has given power to Smchas of Wells in his name.
And in the last month, the committee was published in this public discussion, which was a lot of support in calling this French Parliament of Wales.
In the name of a member of the SMCHCH member of Wells, or WMPs membership, but at the same time, the P is more a public support than in public discussion.
A member of SMchasha also presents another option, but it will be a more versus for Elin Jones, who is the president of this meeting this time, and was expected to file the law of this change in a few weeks.
The law of this reform will include other changes, including the arrangement of the SMCHCHC, the rules, the preception of a member of the SMSCH, and the design of the system.
A member of the Smishha will be given the final vote, which will be a decision on the subject of the question that they should be named as to how to discuss this law.
The McCindonians voted for the country's rename.
The people who have the right to vote on Sunday to make a decision that should change their country as "The Republic of McConeia North."
There's been this kind of preppillar to present a solution to a collection for over a decade and a Greek neighbor who has his own state called McConeni, too.
Athens has always been insisting that the name of the neighboring country in the north indicates the territory of the country, and there is further objection in offering profits to be members of the EU and NATO.
Gorge Ivanov, president of McConeia, would not agree with the publicity of the name of this time, and he said, "He'll ignore this.
However, a group of convoys, including Zoran Zaev, the minister argues that this change is worth attending the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bell is quiet, and the churches in Harlem are facing difficulties.
"The old people I spoke to told me, there was a bar and burrows in every head," said Adam.
"Now, there's no more."
He said that the missing of the bar was understood.
"The people are socially different from the ancients," he said.
"Ban isn't a living room in a house where people are going to be routine again."
For church, he was worried that the money from selling assets could not make them longer as long as the leaders expected, "not long enough, they would return to the same place he was living."
He added that the church was replaced by a constraint building full of people who didn't save the rest of the neighborhood.
"The majority of the people who came in to buy those white condos," he said, "This is a factor that rushs these churches to shut down faster, because the people who moved in to Condo would not be able to be members of these church."
They were originally built by the white community before Harlem became a black city of the city in 1870 and built a St. Martin church in the next decade.
The New Encyclopædia Britannica, which was the original white community, moved out in 1930.
The black communities in the neighborhood who used to bow down so they could go to church instead.
The black community came to the St. Martin church under the leadership of Mr. John Howard Johnson, leaders of the street marketing, 125 roads, which were the main route to the shopping shopping of Harlem, who opposed the black work.
In 1939, a big fire struck the church, and when the clergyson's students planned to build a church, they built a bell.
Blessed is David Johnson's son, Johnson's son, and he is the successor of St. Martin church, proud to mention this bell, "It's a bell of the poor."
The expert who was playing a bell in July said to this bell dress in one way: "It's a culture treasure."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Mishigan University, also noticed that this was the first bell in the world that played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind who moved to play a large beller than 18 years ago at the Riverside church.
Dr. Merweather said that St. Martin church didn't find anyone else to replace him after that.
What happened to the St. Martin church in months was a complex story about the architecture and the contractor, which some came through by the leading of the church leaders of the people, some of them came in by the king's council.
The council -- which is made with the leaders of the people -- wrote to the council, concerned, "I'll find a way to throw the price."
Some of the students complain that the Mayor lacks clearance.
The shark attacked the 13-year-old boy while blacking the lobster in California.
One shark attacked a 13-year-old boy, while he was blacking water for a lobster in California at the opening of the lobster lobster.
This incident happened before 7 o'clock near the Beacon beach at Cintas.
Chad Hamel spoke to the KWB-TV of San Diego that he was blacking with his friends about half a Saturday morning, when he heard the boy crying for help, he swims into a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he thought that the sound was exciting to catch a dragon lobster, but then he realized that it was screaming, 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!'
Hammel said that when he got to the boy, he saw the child's bone torn out.
"I screamed to everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel told more.
The boy was taken to the Raddy Hospital hospital at San Diego, which was told that there was a serious illness.
No one knows what kind of shark attacked this child is.
Captain Lifeguard Larryกิลes said to the reporters that several weeks ago someone saw a shark in that area, but it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim was injured on the top.
After that, the beach has been closed since Pontobad at Casablad to Swami's at Ecintas for 48 hours to investigate and safety.
กิลes noticed there's more than 135 sharks in that area, but most of them are not dangerous species.
Sinsbury's plan to push himself into the beauty market in England.
Sinsbury's coming to replace Boots, Superdugs, and Debenhams with a shopping style with an expert expert in consulting.
The self-responsively pushing itself into the British beauty market, which is sold to 2.8 million pounds [2.8 million pounds] and continues to grow, while the marketing of fashion and the equipment has fallen, this great beauty store will be experimented with 11 stores in all over the country, and it increases in the next year.
The beauty investment is coming, the shopping store wants to look for a way to use space on the floor to replace the product once, the microwave and the use device in the house.
Sainsbury's said there will be double-driver beauty presentations, with more than 3,000 kinds of products, including brands such as Revlon, Esie, Tweezerman, and Dr. ProwPaw for the first presentation.
And the original brands, such as L'Oreal, บางที Bets and the Bees, are also shared in the part of Brand, as they found in the store like boots.
On the side of the supermarket, it's also open up the poppy-making booth again, so most of the products are friendly with health lovers -- which is a new buyer needs more.
At the same time, the fragrance Chop perfumers were going to test the store from Sainsburgy's two stores, which the first store was opened in Cryydon south London, and the last two weeks were opening up at Sely Oak, Birming this year.
The online shopping and the behavior of the consumer behavior that changes to buy a little daily food at the convenience store, which suggests that supermarket is going to have to find a way to get the consumer to use more services.
Mike Coupe, the high executive of Sainsbury's said that it would look more like a store store store, since supermarket is trying to fight the sale store at the usual cost of Aldi and Lide with more than food.
Sinsbury's been putting Argos outlets in the store stores over a hundred store stores, and there's been a number of areas since they bought both Shane two years ago, where Sainssbury' said, it's a increase of store sales, and it increases the business.
Before that, supermarket tried to improve the beauty and medicine, but eventually failed.
Sinsbury's experimented with the boots at the beginning of 2000, but this relationship ended after it was unable to deal with the income shares that came from a supermarket store.
So new strategy happened after Sainsbury's business sold 281 to Celsio, the owner of Shane Pharmacy, was $ 125 million a year ago.
Sainsbury's said ลอยs will be involved in this plan by adding brands to luxurry products, such as La Roche-Posay, and four stores.
Pauls-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's trader, said, "We have a change of appearance and a new store's atmosphere to add a good sense to our client.
Besides, we also have a special investment for our employees to provide good advice with their clients.
Unless our brands have been designed to suit every need, there is a place where a comfortable store is among the environment, and attracting, that means that we're a focus and a challenge to modern shopping."
Peter Jones was very angry after Holly Willoughly left the 11 million pounds of business together.
Peter Jones, an actor of the Dragons Den, fell in the ' after the Presenator TV Holly Willoughley left his 11 million-pound business, and went to focus on her new promise with Mark andสเปนเซอร์ and it's worth $11 million.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the machine in the house, and the sympathetic under their brands.
Both businesss have been compared to Gwinth Paltrow brands.
Presenter, morning, 37 years old, announced in her Instagram that she was quitting.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, an actor of the Dragonsden with anger, with withdrawing out of the brand Life Life style that was profited in the last second -- and focused on her new promise and Mark and สเปนเซอร์, and it was a V.
The source says Jones, "A very angry," when the golden minute of TV accepted at the conference on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business headquarters at Marclow, Buckinghamshire said that her new contract is worth 1.5 million pounds -- which means she doesn't have time to use the inside and to add up their equipment anymore.
This business has been compared to the Gwynth Paltrow brand, which has had a salesman, and made Willoughby's sales about 11 million pounds.
As soon as Willoughby was 37 years old, she was preaching in Instagram that she could quit the fact that Jones was flying out of England to his home in the airhouse immediately.
One source said, "I knew it was the first thing to do with Holly's first priority.
Because that's her long-term future, which you can see that you can take her for more than two decades.
Your decision to withdraw this will definitely surprise everyone who's involved.
No one believes that this is going to happen last Tuesday because it's nearly open the whole day.
And the product was ready to sell the warehouse at the headquarters at Marlow."
The experts believe that the death of Presenter's show is this morning, who is one of the most successful light stars of England, would damage this business millions of dollars because of the heavy investments in various products since the pillows, candles, and clothing, and the open body may be slower.
And that means that the end of a long friendship.
Mother, three, Willoughby, and Dan Baldwin's husband, had been close to Jones, and Tara Capp's wife for ten years.
Willoughby founded on Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined by restraining the president in March.
Both families went to the air together, and Jones had 40 percent shares in Baldwin's TV show.
Willoughby is brand Ambassador to M.S. and will be a part of Ant McPartlin on the show I'm a celbrity of itV.
A very close source with Jones said last night, "We can't comment on this."
We're in love with each other.
He's funny about the critics he's received from the media of which some might feel "no president," and the world is very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why would President Rump give up like this?
Trampe, speak with "Servationer".
"We didn't give up anything."
He noticed that Kim was interested in meeting for the second time after the first time he met in Singapore, in June, which Trampe praised North Korea in the nuclear weapons of nuclear weapons.
But the negotiation of deliberate nuclear weapons stops.
The high-level North Korea General Riong Ho spoke to the world leaders at the U.N. Saturday afternoon conference. (U.N.A., North Korea said that Koreans had no "responsibility" from the U.S.A.A. to the movement of North Korea before.
But back then, he noticed that the United States still has continued pressure.
But Trammp still has a good view of his negotiation at that time.
"We're going well with North Korea," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
But now we have a very good relationship."
He said that the attempt to connect with Kim brought positive results -- the rocket testing ended, helped hostages and the rest of the American soldiers go home.
And he argues in an unusual way when he's asked about his affair with Kim:
"It's very easy to use the president's position, but instead of making 10,000 people out here, we'll just give 200 people to stand here."
Tsunami and an earthquake on the island of Indonia, killing hundreds of people.
The smoke from the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign private organizations said they're not wanted.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population have to move the base area, there is no news about the disaster that's happening in the country, the help of the nation needs urgently.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they're very clear that they don't want foreign help, it's very challenging." Mrs. Sumbung said.
While you're doing this, you know, you're not sure the foreign agents can go to the area.
Mr. Sutopo, the National disaster force said that Agent India is evaluating the situation at Palu to allow foreign authorities to help?
Even if Indonia is patient with a constant earthquake, this country is still not ready to deal with the tragic anger of nature.
While the temporary shelter for the disaster was created at Aceh, it could not be seen at the other sea coast.
Even though it was a warning to tsunami, it was obvious that the lack of tsunamis at Palu had a loss of life.
And in normal times, the travel between islands in Indonesia is a challenge.
The more natural disasters make the transfer more difficult.
A normal nurse ship will be parked in Lombok to keep the wounded from the earthquake, and it must be at Palu first, but on the journey to the new disaster scene, it will take at least three days.
President Joko Wido has issued the development of Indonia's glorious structure as the main campaign to find his voice, and he has put a lot of money on the road and train.
And the financial lack of money has taken over your office, Joko, a difficult seat, because next year he's going to have to go to the election session again.
Mr. Joko is also faced with pressure from slowness of member in Indonesia, which most members are Muslims and still have an old faith.
More than 1,000 people die, and hundreds of thousands of people have to flee their homes because the Christian and Muslims have killed their teeth on the streets with a knife, bow, and other serious weapons.
It's always going to be a score, Chelsea.
Daniel Stordrick helped Liverpool to defeat Chelsea in Premierson with a vote in 89 on Saturday, St.ford บริดจ์ in London.
Storgick took the kid from Xherdan Shakeiri, who was 30 yards away from Chelsea's Golden Globe while his team was on the back of 1-0 points.
He touched the kid to the left slowly before the spoon went up and shot at the pole that was away.
So they're running high above Gold and floating into the corner on the right side of the net.
The ball across Kpa Arrizabalaga, which is smacking up and entering the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position to get closer to the ball and Shake, which Shake always played as much ahead as I could, and I'm just trying to create the chance as much as possible."
"I saw Kante coming, and I touched one time, and I didn't think so much, just shoot."
Chelsea took 1-0 in a while after the เอเดน of Belgian star scored in a minute 25 minutes.
That shot, a silver lion's front, kicks your son back to Mateo Kovacic before you pull around the middle and run into the half side of theเวอร์pool.
Kovacig did send-and-Go quickly to the middle.
Then he sends a beautiful baby straight through the hound, and then he sends it to Gold.
Dan, run faster than the back, and end up kicking an affair with the left leg across Alisson Becker's Furpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli at the National Champion at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at St.A.o, SanPolo in Naples, Italy.

The Crymwell Preparation has become the story of the Hitts right now about "new record of history."
The banishment is justice in his poetic interpretation, which holds it as a culture and religion that operates by his strict followers.
But the Crymwell Society described the offer of death.
John Goldin, president of Crymwell, said, "Of course, the goal of this argument is to move the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside of the Westminster's palace.
Destroying the image of war in the middle of England was not ordered or walked by Cromwell.
Maybe Cromwell was accused of offering himself for what the ancestors ofโทมัส had done in the century.
The description of Mr. Cromwell's beautiful, Mr. William Hamo Thorneycroft, is the idea of the 19th century, and part of the history of people who believe that it is worth the celebration.
Death Gold Smith said to theเดย์ Telegraph: "Maybe someone who remembered Cromwell in the way of protecting an outside state of pressure, in this case, it certainly means that the royal family might be much more than the end of the 19th century.
And that's all a real presentation, is the history subject to further disputes.
What, of course, is that the argument in the mid - 17th century has caused the development of the nation, as we now see, and Cromwell is a reminder that represents one of the Separatists.
His success as the Lord of wardrobe is worth the celebration and a memorial."
The pig killer sculptures of China until death.
Based on local news, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in the south of China.
The man only knew his sculpture was found in a red artery, lying in a blood station near a pig in the market at Lipusunshchi, Guuwa, a newspaper from South China Post, reporting Sundays.
The farmer prepared to inject pig pigs in Xining, China, on May 30, 2005.
According to the news, he went to Yoon Long, a neighbor's area with his cousins to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and found out that the pig door was open.
He said that one of the big pigs in the crane had blood on his mouth.
According to the report, legal proof confirms that the pigs are 550 pounds of pigs have snuffed this farmer to death.
"My brother Lu's leg is full of blood and sucks," the cousin of Skull said "woo," references from the Guii-Kiing News newspaper.
According to the security evidence, it shows that they've entered the market at 4:40 of Thursday morning to feed their pigs.
His body was found in an hour later.
The pig who killed this man wasn't his thing or his cousin.
The market manager said to the newspaper that the pig had been locked up to prevent anyone from attacking anyone while waiting for the police to gather evidence in the crime scene.
According to the news, the family's talking to the market manager about his death cost.
Even if the pig attacks humans to death was a little bit small, it turns out that there was a record earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm at Mexico, turned out to be a man who was a severe husband.
And ten years ago, one of the 650 pounds of pigs fled one of the Nazis and his tracker car until his wife had to come out and scare him and fire him.
And then after one of the Nazis Oregons was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one of the Nazis Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs usually don't aggressive, but the taste of blood may be "the trigger."
"They're just a joke.
They like to bite, want to see, they don't mean to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
Herrcanrossa's tail brought a lot of rain to the south of the United States.
According to the prophecy, Herrcanroza was weak after a colder pass over the coast of McCico.
However, Rosa will bring a heavy rain to the north of McCeogo and the south of the United States in a few days.
Rosa has a wind passing by 85 miles per hour, as Hercan 1 on Sunday, at 5 o'clock in the east and at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, McCa.
Guess Rosa's moving north on Sunday.
At the same time, the wind is making up north of the Pacific Ocean and moving east to the west coast of the United States, when Rosa approaches the Baja Peninsula, California, on Monday, with a hot storm started taking the heat into the west side of the south of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain into all parts of Mexico on Monday.
And then, the heat is going to deal with the approaching wind waves, which will cause a heavy rain all over the west area in the next few days.
In the local rain fell on 1 to 4 inches, it would have caused suddenly from the flooding water, and there could be a land crashing in the desert.
The tropical heat that covers is caused by the rain rate of two to three inches per hour per point, especially the parts of Nevada and the Arizona.
Guess the rainfalls all over the south side are going to have a lot of 2-4 inch, but there's more than the area of Arizona.
With the rains of the sky spread, suddenly floods and can increase violence.
Let the people not travel with empty feet into the desert with a lot of hot rainfalls that fell so hard at that time.
The heavy rain that could cause the deep valley to become a river that flows and rains, it would also cause wind and dust to spread.
The wind waves that come near this will bring a heavy rain in the region of the south coast of California.
More than half inch of rain can cause a little rubbish and a slipway.
Guess this would be the first rainfall in this region.
It's a hot rain that began to get near Arizona on Sundays and Monday morning before the rain spread around during Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread to four Corners during Tuesday and will stretch until Wednesday.
In October, I'll see the thick temperatures wave through the United States because the Arctic starts cold, but the hot zone is still warm.
Sometimes this happens to bring the temperatures that are changing around the cities that are nearby.
There's a very good example of different climates across the middle of the United States on Sundays.
With nearly 20 degrees of temperatures, like between the City City, Missouri and Omaha, and theเนบราซิล and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
And in the next few days, the warmness of summers will build up and spread out again.
In most parts of the middle and east of the United States, the U.S.A. suspects that this warmth begins in October, with the wind spread about 80s out of the south area to some part of the east east.
New York City may have 80 degrees high on Tuesday, which is 10 degrees higher than normal temperature.
Our long-term weather prediction shows that there's a high chance at the east temperature of the United States in the first half of the month of October is usually higher than normal.
There are over 20 million audiences watching Bret Kavanaugh's appeal.
On Thursday, more than 20 million audiences were watching the evidence of the evidence offered as a high court of Bret Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, from six networks, women who accused him of being raped in 1980s.
While political conflicts still continue to spread the television station changed the regular program of Friday in the last second, since Senator Jeffreg, theเซน of Jeff Flake heard that the FBI was allowed to investigate the crime investigation for a week.
Ford said to the National Council Council Council board, she was 100 percent confident that Kavana Lubak was drunk with her trying to take her clothes off at the high school.
Kavanaugh confirms his emotions in prison that he's 100 percent confident that the event is definitely not going to happen.
Nelson, report on Friday, says there's more than 204 million audiences who follow this hearing.
The company has to count the average number of audiences in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and EMBBC.
But it can't be able to count the audience immediately with other networks, such as PBS, C-PAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And normally, Nelson has a problem with the number of audiences watching at the office and working.
If it's a picture of the audience, the size of the football game is as good as the final or the Oscar prize.
Fox's ข่าว, a show-of-the-the-a-making program that has a hard-conceived proof of the Kavanaugh made up of all the networks with about 5.69 million people who listen to the judgment all day, Nelson.
ABC's going to be the second at 3:26 million audiences.
CBS has 3.1 million NBC, 2.94 billion M.M.N.E.C. and CNN. has 2.52 million Nelson.
The attention is still in high places after the end of the day.
Flake is the main character of what happened on Friday.
After the republic's conference, the idea that he might agree to Kavanaugh's camera, and CBS caught it on Friday morning, he was yelling at the protesters while he was trying to come up to the elevator with the board.
CNN's been broadcasting live, his picture was standing down for a few minutes after he was drawn into it.
"I'm standing in front of you right now," a woman said to him.
"You think he's telling the whole country the truth?
"You have power while women have no power," he was told.
Fleake said his agency had announced a statement and said before the elevator shuts down, he had a lot of things to say to the board in this presentation.
Cable and TV networks have covered the hours of broadcast to live live in the time of the vote committee to drive the name of Kavanaugh to be a full senator.
But Fletch said he would do that if the FBI would check out the charges associated with the next week, which would be a little request from Democratic voice.
In some conversation with his friends, Senator Dimoctic Criscules, Chris Coons, was convinced to believe.
And after talking to Coons and several Senator Fletacks, they decided.
Fleck's choice is very powerful, because it's obvious that the Replicated will not agree to Kavanaugh without a search for the truth.
President Trampe opened the way to the FBI to investigate the fact that it was related to Kavanaugh.
Mr. Mayor, accused the critics of political play with Brian.

In another interview on the same page of the same page of her interview, the former foreign president Boris Johnson attacked her very hard to call her a chess plan for Brian, by offering the U.S.A. and the European Union, "A."

The ashes from the Mount of Popocatepetl came to the village south of Mexico's capital.

The other area of the Southwest desert, including the Middle East of Rocky and the Basin, is going to have 1 to 2 inch of the area.
For the risk of floods suddenly, the rain from Rosa may be good because the region has been suffered from death for a long time.

The U.S. should give us a double amount of money to the A.I.
Because China is very eager to make research, the United States should support the money of this side research twice as much as Kai-Fu Lee investors and an AI who used to work for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This idea happened after all the parts of the U.S. government have been announced on AI without official tactics about AI.
While China had started a plan last year, China was determined to be one of the innovations about AI within 2030 years.
"AI is double as a good start, making countries that are tired behind the United States, still behind, and we expect to see a big development on AI," said Lee.
Two times more investments can add twice as much chance to the U.S. has reached the next AI, which is called CNBC to interview this week.
Lee, the owner of the book "AI Superกําลังs: จีน, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order" published this month by Hookon Harlint, was the CEO of Sinovion Wetures, which invested in one of the famous companies on AIV+.
In 1980 at Carnegie Mellon University, he tried to win the biggest players of the Othello, and then he was the executive of Microsoft and president of Google China branch.
Lee, thank you for the technology set up by the former government, such as the researchal atoms of Robotics, and ask, when will they do it again, that they will continue to help us learn more about the vision?
The U.S. researchers always have to work hard to give the government's support.
"It's not China to pull a leading leader, but a company," said Lee.
Now both Facebook, Google, and other technology companies hire the qualified from the university to work on AI.
Lee said, changing the policy of the city, maybe helping the United States support the development of AI.
"I think Greencard should automatically be released to Dr. A.I," he added.
The Chinese Council of China, there's a new development of intelligence, Aextarian Intelligence Intelligence, then in 2017.
China's natural science Institute (China's National Science Institute) has funded people in education institutions, as at the National Science Institute and other government institutions that support the U.S. researchers, but China's education has a lower picture of Lee.
In the early years, the United States Department (U.S.) established a common intelligence center Aint Atelligence, which means that there were partners from the U.S.A. and the university involved, and the White House had been announced in the Atelligence of the A.
And in this month, DARPA announced to investing $2 billion U.S. in the beginning of the idea called "AI" in the United States.
And recently, NSF invested over 100 million dollars a year in research about AI.
But at the same time, the U.S. law of security has been asked to set up a national security committee on A.N.A.A. on Intellence hasn't seen any progress since months.
Don't you think I'm going to vote for the vote to make it sound that I'm going to change my country?
Will the people of มา ซิ โด เนีย be a public voice on Sunday to change their country as "The Republic of the North of Macedonia" or this movement to solve the Pittt for over ten years and Greek (Greece) who can't be a member of Europe and Napotheonato.
The กรีซ, who has a state named มา ซิ โด เนีย, also wants this neighboring country to keep the same name as a privilege in the border and against this country, not to enter the Natto and Europe.
The two governments were fought in June, since the new name presented, the rivals of the patriots argue that this rename will be the identity of the Slavic, most of the people of มา ซิ โด เนีย.
President Gorge Ivanov says that he won't join in the publicity and the disastrous campaigns are making the question of at least 50 percent of the results.
The question to vote is: "Are you going to be a member of Nato NATO and the EU by accepting the deal of the กรีซ?
The supportor renamed, including the president of Zoran Zaev, argues that it's worth it, one of the country apart after the fall of the ยูโกสลาเวีย, if it was part of the Council, such as the US and NATO.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of the nation of มา ซิ โด เนีย, so that they may live freely under the shadow of the European Union, because that means life is safer for us."
Even though it's not legal binding, there are enough congressman members to say they're taking votes that come out of judgment.
The name can be changed. It's got to be two in three in the congression.
The National Bureau board says at 1:00 there's no report on any disorder.
However, only 16 percent of the votes compared to the last congression in 2016, where people came out of 66 percent.
"I'm out loud because my children are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted at the Skopj.
His wife, Zoran Zava, his son, and Dushko had voted in the public rename of มา ซิ โด เนีย to open the country to the NATO and the European Union at Strimica, in September 30, 2018.
In front of Skpje Vladim, Kavardarkov, 54, had prepared a small stage, and the chaffers had set up several chairs in front of the tent.
"We're ready to attend NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the vocalta, not by the service gate," said Kavadarkov.
"Even if we were poor country, we were proud.
If he doesn't want to accept us with the name of มา ซิ โด เนีย, we can still turn another way like China or Russia, and become part of the mixture between Europe and Asia."
The Minister Zaev said that the NATO member of NATO would bring a investment that needed to ມາ doubt, which has more than 20 percent of the space rate.
"I believe most people love it, because over 80 percent of the U.S. citizens like it and the NATO," said after taking his vote.
He said the result of the "responsibility" will confirm our future.
It's an idea that the public study institutions of Postthy Research Institute published on Monday, that about 30 percent of the people who were going to go out in the public, which was less than the voted.
Another commenting was made by the Telma TV ofมา, found that 57 percent of the responders had plans to go out on Sunday.
And in that number, 70 percent said they voted, agree.
So it's going to be an introvert, the number of people who come out is going to be 50 percent plus one vote.
This failure will show the first critical chance of political events that supported the Western government since its position in May last month.

When Momentum's movement in my local party sounds out of my criticity, it's not surprising.
After that, I was the last person on the list of laborers who said that we're not welcome-- that's all who spoke according to their own ideas.
My associates in my Parliament, Joan Ryan, were similarly suspensive when she stood up against the Jews.
In my case, the critic reviews that I don't agree withเจเรมี่ Corbyn.
Which is to compare with the importance of the trust economic policy in the safety of the nation, and Europe, the same as the problem thatเจเรมี่ did not agree with the former leaders.
It's called the Totingham East East East Lebour meeting on Friday, which says, "We need a meeting that covers and is effective."
For me, as a member of the laborator for eight years, the GC conference on Friday is exactly what it is.
Sadly, today, not a lot of meetings, and the political contract that's kind, gentle, gentle, who's forgotten for a long time, but it's actually never happened.
As a result, it is obvious that the opinion is not accepted in laborers, and every opinion will be judged by the conclusive leaders.
This happened after he had come up for a while, because my associates thought that I could share a similar political image, starting to expect me to turn back and take the place I never thought to accept -- whether for the safety of the nation or the Europeans.
Whenever I say it doesn't matter what I say-- it's always followed by blazing on Socia Midia that I shouldn't be chosen for the city of the middle part of which I shouldn't be in labor.
But that's not just what I've been through.
I know I'm lucky to be more than many of my associates because of the opinion that sent me, most of them are politically political.
I feel smitting in professionality and determination that those of these associates can face the flow of blasphemy or my class every day without shame and despondent.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the city of this time is why the insult can become a normal thing like this.
เจเรมี่ Corbyn called for the last week to support the culture of patience.
But in fact, we're not a community that accepts open ideas, with every movement without confidence, or change of some rules, making the idea of a small group.
I got a lot of advice in the past two years, asking me to head down, don't say too much, and I'll say "Okay."
But that's not what makes me step into this city's path.
Since I've been in the laboratory for 32 years since I was a student, there's been a flashing of governmentism, which means my idea to go to school, but turned to public service for someone who wanted to be the local council or the minister.
I've never been hiding my politicians, even at the last election.
No one in Totingham East will be confused about my political positions and stories that I disagree with the present leaders.
For those who promote the movement on Friday, all I can say is, when countries are plowing their way to the homes, our public service, will be damaged, and I don't understand why they'll waste their time and energy on my loyalty to my labor leader for what?
But there's a statement that I really want to say, but not with Notingham Momentum, but who votes for me, whether or not, I'm very proud to serve you, and I promise that there's no threat or political advantage that will stop me from doing my job.
Chris Leslie was an MP member of the Totingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17เมลรอส: Ayr's victory.
The next two attempts may be a bad score, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserves the victory at the Pearrchip of Tennt.
Now, they're 10ths that no one can cut down.
In the end, it's a great protection, including taking a chance to get Hom, and coach Peter Murchie smiled with the work.
"We've been through the whole game test, and we're still standing through, so I deserve to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christy ofเมลrose said: "The credit for Ayr, they'll take better chances than we do."
For the children of Tyr at the 14 minutes of Grant Anderson, by sending Fraer Climo to Ayr on front, but with Rory Townhee, Captain from Scotland, got a yellow ticket out of the game, madeเมลros a little more shallow, and the Jason Baggot can place.
Climo Dun Ayr up to the point before the first half he did with solo up to the 17-5th.
Butเมลrose had started half a good time, and with a tyre of Patrick Anderson's son from Baggot's delivering only five points of Langways.
Then it was a long time to stop because Ruridh Knott was wounded in the legs, and after the new game, Ayr opened fast examples of Stifford McDowall by sending Climo.
And then Blair McPerson kept Ayr's captain had been given yellow, andเมลrose made a point from Bruce Colvine's Tiger's son, ended with a fierce game.
The team returned again, and when Striun Hutchinson got a yellow license from attacking Climo without a ball, made MacPherson down the blame point, and made Ayr able to get back.
Climo sent it immediately after Kyle Rowe took a kick from David Armin and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth Tiger team.
It's a star. I think it's a game that's turning into a new career in the restaurant industry.
The star of the game, the Ford Kieran, turned to the service industry after the name was found as a company of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star shows that Jack จาrvis on the list of BBC's popularity, which he wrote and played with a funny star who was the oldest partner of Greg Hemphill.
They both announced that the nine of them were going to be the last of the show, and it turns out that Kiernan was planning their lives after Craigilang.
According to the official record list, he's a company of Adriftmor Limed's company.
He refused to comment on this, even though Scottish Sun's source was sour that Kiernan was considering joining "Glasgow's interesting restaurant business."
'The sea belongs to us: โบลิเวีย, who will never go to the sea, hoping that the court will open the path to the Pacific again.
Navy patrols, the headquarters of the Navy at La Paz.
These buildings are adorned with blue flag.
The Navy has a base since Lake Titicaca to Amazon, adorned with fear: "The sea is our right rights in the sea.
"The right is back to the job."
Every part of the โบลิเวีย that would never go to the sea is a clear memory of the loss of the coast to Chile in the blood incident of the 19th century -- because it was a strong desire to sail into the Pacific Ocean again.
This hope may be the greatest hope of over the last ten years, because โบลิเวีย is waiting for judgment by justice on October 1, after five years of punction.
"Bapolivia, there's a spirit of peace and peace, and of course, looking at the results that are positive," said Robert Calzadilla.
The โบลิเวียs set up judgment by ICJ with large screens that are located all over the country, hoping that the Court in The Hague will agree with the call of the โบลิเวีย -- after ten years of conversation -- Chile was forced to leave the sea with the sea.
Evo Morales, president of the original natives of the โบลิเวีย -- who are facing the fight of the new elections in the next year -- there are many things that have been in charge of this Monday.
"We're too close to get back to the Pacific Ocean," he swore at the end of August.
But some analyst believed that the court wouldn't judge the side of the โบลิเวีย, but that might have changed.
The UN Council with a base in the Netherlands has no power to judge the territory of Chile and determine that it will not be defined as a possible conversation.
ICJ's judgment will come out six months after hearing the final argument indicates that this case is not complicated.
And if you're going to find the cause of the last four years, you might have to go back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been taken away by the โบลิเวีย's government now," said Zyr.
The art of the Morales who invited that fight was despicing the rest of the children of Chile, she suggested.
In some places, โบลิเวีย and Chile are still talking, but it's hard to consider later.
The two countries have not been traded since 1962.
Ade President Eduardo Rodrcirez Veltzé's agent at the "The Hague" refuses to think that the decision of the court is unusual.
On the day of Jantine will lead to the "a special opportunity to open a new relationship with Chile" and the opportunity to end the disunity of the difference between the profits for 139 years, he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales -- still one of the presidents of Latin America, with the most popular people -- used the problem to walk as a political ship.
"Bapolivia will never give up in access to the Pacific Ocean," he said more.
"The judge has a chance to see that we have to move through the past."
North Korea says that nuclear weapons will never be until they can trust the United States.
His country will never reduce nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ry, there was a statement on Saturday at the United Nations conference, saying,
He called the U.S. to track down a promise that was given to Samdam's conference between the leaders.
He commented that the U.S. secretary Mike Pompeo seemed to start talking about nuclear advocating after having a meeting with Kim Joong Unni over three years ago.
Ri says it's "the dream pipe" that's done with the U.S. objection to the end of Korea will bring North Korea to trust.
Washington doesn't trust the end of war until he sees Pearngyang demolition as the first step.

Paris fashion showed the latest product that was about to put the main store stores near your house.
If you want to add a hat to your collection, or you really need a sun together, you don't have to go somewhere else.
Desiner Valentino and Thom Browne have shown a hat for the SS19 on the Lanway in Paris, the Fashion Week.
The hat that can't work today has broken the Instagram in this summer.
It's made by Valentino, a broad hat, made with a material like a feather, a sponge like a sculpture over her head.
Other large equipment, like a jewel, a magic hat, and even a helmet -- but they're not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne has a manifestation of a strange mask with-- and that's exactly the time of Halloween.
There's a lot of masks full of colors that are sewed up to Hannibal Lecter, more than a design that comes out of the lead room.
There's a piece of artifact that looks like a submarine device, with deep black glasses and on the surface, while another piece looks like a melting ice cream.
And if you're still following this big fashion statement, you're lucky.
The watcher's guessing that a huge scumbag hat will be distributed at your main store store near your house.
This bigger hat has been hot since 'La Bomba',' we'll see these two feet wide hats from many of Rihna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult lot behind the hat that could not be used in the life of the day that fell through the socidia caused a new invention on another catastrophe - a big beach bag nearly as much as a swim model.
The orange bag made of palm trees cut off by palm trees and white ears of white skins, the most outstanding piece of Jacquemus' Larivia SS19 collections in Paris, Fashion Week.
The designer gave Luke Aralage: 'I expected to see these big hats and beach pockets coming to the main road next summer -- because Dyers built this huge impact, it was hard to overlook the need of this larger device.'
John Edward: The language skills necessary for the world's citizens.
Stockland's private school has a history of education and continues in the year 2561 with another outstanding test that has been strengthened by the success of individuals and groups of music and community sports and other communities.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools represent the private council of Scotland, determined to give the best service to students and parents.
The private school has a purpose to prepare students for education and higher than the choice career and place as citizens of the world.
As a study that is designed and used as a school course in need, we see that modern language is popular and needed within school.
เนลสัน Mandella says: "If you speak to someone in his language that he understands, it's going to go straight to his brain.
If you talk to him in his language, the word will go straight to the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English when we want to build a relationship and trust with people from other countries.
In this year's last test, we can see that language is more important, with the highest exam rate in private school.
68 percent of the students, which have learned foreign languages, will get A high grade.
The data that gathered from school members of S.S. 74ths showed that 72 percent of the students get an A.A. in Mandarin 72 percent of Germans, 69 percent of French, and 63 percent of Spain, also got an A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages to strengthen children's skills and students must be in the future.
Today, language is one of the options of 'StEM, technology, engineering and mathematical, in the course of private school and other places.
According to a investigation by the office of the office, the work committee and the British skill in 2557 found that the reason you hired a problem to hire a 17-centre position was caused by the lack of language skills.
So language skills will be more important to prepare students for future careers.
Because the opportunity to work with more language is that these skills are important in the world of the world.
Without saying a choice career, if they learn the second language, they'll be very powerful in the future with such skills.
In order to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, it'll make people speak many languages automatically in their careers.
According to the survey of the MaGov, from over 4,000 British adults in 255656% can't speak abroad enough to talk and French language is the only language to speak, and it's the number of two hundred percent.
So that's why the investment of teaching language is important for children now.
The ability to speak a lot of languages, especially countries that are developing, will make children a better chance to find work.
In Scotland, every school will be taught different languages.
A lot of schools will focus on classical languages, while others will teach the language that seems to be the most important thing in the kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child has interest in a language, there is still a lot of language to choose a private school with a skilled teacher in this area.
A private school in Scotland was determined to present the environment of learning to prepare a child and practice skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future would be.
And it can't be denied at this time in the environment that has a global business that language is still very important to the future of the country, so this is going to be reflected in education.
And the modern language should be considered as "a international communication skills."
The private school will continue to present a variety of options and beauty for Scottland's youth.
Il Fat bien Levee.

President Donald Ching started the rally to find a voice tonight on the car to find a voice at West Virginia.
This is the first day in Rallie's five-time Trumpet next week, including stopping at an interesting place, including in Tennessee and Mississpi.
For a vote for a free election for the Court of Court, the Trump has a goal to increase the support of the mid-term elections, because the Refoldings are risked to lose the seat in the congression when they voted in November.
The rally's been looking for a shrimp tonight at West Virginia, which time is where you're going to be watching online?
The rally's been looking for a shrimp at West Virginia will start at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.

Chicks tend to be more likely to consider the Bret Kavanaugh case this week, who was offered a name for the Court of Courta, which was accused of sexual immorality by remorseing the Senate that is still not confirming during the interrogation of the FBI for a week.
But the main target of Raly's finding a voice this time is to help add a voice base to the revolved party in the May of the month to come.
There were five of the targets of Raly to find the president's voice in this week, saying, "Call the volunteers and the Reformings came out to protect and raise the sound base to let them take a position in the Parliament like the same news from Royster.

"This is not a good sign for Morrisy, where the president has to come down to raise his own voice," said Simon Haeder, political analyst of West Virginia.
The U.S.A team is fighting to win a solo on Sunday.
After three months of one field, four hours a Saturday afternoon, that's what Ircup wants.
Each shot is perfect for this game, which is what golf players often believe, but not for the competition this time.
Now what should the scourge be?
"They've got six points, and now there's four, so we think we're not going to have to hurry" จอ ร์แดน Spith said at the end of the game that day.
Of course, the Europe is now the advantage of taking four points, and the other 12 shots to play.
As Spieth said for the Americans, they think they're doing well, and they're very strong, not only the Spith play form and the 'cause of the 'cause of all the days that they play together, and from the four points of Spith.
Spith led from T to Green and brought the team by making it an example.
A little louder to his rounds, and he's gonna have to be a very important faulscar when both of them and Thomas are using two shots.
His puppet made them win 15W and made everyone excited, and he believed that the American team wasn't even worse than anyone.
"You always sink and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
Which all players are always like this.
18 graves to win.
The only player who only had a high score of Spith and Thomas all these days, this is Frenchsco โมinari and ทอมมี่ Fleetwood, which is a story in the history of Rider Cup.
A strange couple, but cute from Europe, four out of four points and never misses anything.
The only couple who didn't go through the buffet on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided Boge on Saturday afternoon, Friday afternoon, and at nine Fridays this morning, too.
The energy they have, and the cheerleaders believe they'll win on Sunday, there's no playmate who's going to get closer to Europe anymore, except Fleetwood or Moinari for this game Le Golf Nationals.
Especially when they both play in different holes.
The victory of the ยุโรป is still speaking, even though it's not over.
Buba Watson and Webbsson made a game game with Kier การ์เซีย, the Fourball star got stronger when he matchs with Alex Noren.
Boge and two shot at the nine graves, made Speeards and Swede hold back.
On Sunday, everyone will be determined to end the game.
It's a relationship between the couple, the advice they tell each other, what they don't recommend and how to change the game.
The Europeans are well played, and they brought the game out of the last day, but in Sessphom, it shows that the USA team is inexpensive, especially the U.S.A.
ยุโรป took 10-6 in the last day.
ยุโรป had the greatest advantage of the last day that Ir Cup came after the number of Follballs on Saturday and the From game with 10-6 wins the United States.
The partner watching O'Tommy Fleetwood and Frenchco โมinari wins Tigerwoods twice at Le Golf Nationals.
โทมัส Bjorn from the European team still took the cup he had lost at Hazeltine two years ago and beat the American team in Machfolball in the morning at 3-1.
U.S. raced in Formam wins two games, but it's still not able to follow the scores.
Jim Fryk's coast still needs eight points from a solo game, 12 Matt on Sunday to keep the champion.
Fleetwood's new hand, the first European team who wins four points, while he and Malinari were associated with the name "Molliwood" after winning the game on the weekend, which was the second couple won from four mathematical Cup history.
They beat Woods and Patrick Reed in Machphobal, and then beat Woods and Bryson Dehambeau, the American team got five hundred and four points.
Woods who passed by two match on Saturday again showed a brighter again, but today he lost 19 out of 29 games in Fourballs and foams and contacted each other.
Justin Rose, staying from Furball in the morning, came back with Henry Stentson in Matt Form, and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka with two points, which are one and three of the worlds.
Europe doesn't have a way to be so sweet with roses all the days of cold air on the south of Paris today.
The three-time champions, Spieth, and Justin Thomas built a new record of Americans with two points on Saturdays.
They beat Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in Furball with two points, and they came back to win over Poulter and Rory McIllรอย again in Four hundred.
In the history of Ircup Cup, it's only twice that the team can win in a single race, even if it's four points short, even the Fryk side wants to keep the champion.
However, after two firsts of the first time back from the first day, it seems they can't be able to hit a little bit of a Sunday game.
North Korea will never be able to disarm the only one weapon without being trusted.
The Minister of North Korea said that in the last Saturday, the United Nations continued to announce a suspension because of the distrust in the United States, and there was no way the country would be to disarm the only nuclear weapon in this situation.
Ryong-ho said to the world's largest convention that the North Koreans had used the "the most important values" in the past year, such as nuclear testing and nuclear testing, and rejection to expand nuclear and nuclear weapons.
"Well, we don't get any response from the United States," he said.
"If there's no confidence in the United States, there's no confidence in nation's security and under this situation, there's no way we could disarm one weapon."
While Ri filed a complaint from North Korea on Washington to the way "responsible nuclear weapons" which North Korea received a later process of operation, his statement seemed to be significant that there was no one rejection of nuclear weapons, as Pearngyang did in the past.
Ring quoted the statement that signed by Kim Joong Un and Donald Humm at the first assembly between the president of the United States and the North Korea President in August 12, when Kim promised to carry the nuclear weapon in Korea while the Trumpet guarantees the security of North Korea.
North Korea tried to end the Korean War, 1950-53 official, but the United States said that Pearngyang had to take off nuclear weapons first.
Washington's still standing against the call to cancel the North Korean batteries.
"The United States insists on putting the nuclear weapon off and increase the pressure to reach the target in oppression, and even against "the end of war," said Ri.
"The idea that flipping makes us surrender is the idea of people who don't know about us.
The important problem is, the constantly flipping is to make our trust more."
Ri didn't mention the plan for the second Sam Mitch conference between Kim and the shrimp, which the leaders of the United States had reported to the United States in the early week.
The president of the State Department highlights three times between Kim and Moon Ja-in, the South Korea Leader of Korea, five months ago, and added: "If a couple in this issue of nuclear weapons is under Korea, and not the U.S. nuclear weapons of Korea are not going to stop this."
Even so, Ri's voice was quite a difference between the years, when he filed the greatness of the United Nations, that the commanding of the United States's rocket to the vast land of the United States was an event after "the Demon president" called Kim a rocket.
In the United Nations conference this year, the Trump, who threatened to destroy some of the North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to disarm his weapons, but he said, there's a lot to do, and it's still going to be over Korea until North Korea's nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Ching said he had no time for this, "if it took two years or five months, it's okay."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward the Pearngyang who's been working on this.
However, Mike Pompeo, foreign minister of the United States, said to the U.S. Security Council of State on Thursday: "The use of the substantial charge of the security team must continue seriously and not cancel until we have been confirmed to all nuclear weapons."
The security committee has supported the North Korean substitution since 2006 to bid money for nuclear weapons and pyngyang's missile project.
Pompeo met with Ri, outside of the national convention, and later said he was going to visit Pyongang again in the next month to be prepared for Sammmin second meeting.
Pompeo went to North Korea three times this year, but his final trip wasn't quite successful.
He left Pearngyang in the past month, saying that only Korean progress was condemned by his actions, like, "the command of Mafia" within an hour at the assembly.
North Korea has promised a meeting with Moon this month that will proceed to break up the missiles and nuclear centers if the United States has been determined to use "contemporaries."
He said to him, "Let's see what is in common," which he expected is a promise from the Trumpet that says in Singapore that will guarantee security, and perform a good relationship with the Washington.
Harvard University college students went to school enough courses to rest.
The new course at the University of Harvard University this year is a course of giving every graduate student more sleep to break up the culture that extends up with the caffeine fuel for all the Hug nights.
The students found that the first university student in the world doesn't always have any idea when talking about basic ways to take care of himself.
Charles Cisler, professor of sleep at the University of Harvard and experts at Briggham's โรง พยาบาล, designed course that he believed was the first course in the United States.
He was inspired to start building this course after talking about the lack of sleep that would affect learning.
'In the end of the course, there was a student who came to me and said, 'Why did you just tell me this when I was last year?'
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep, which made me very surprised.
This course opened the first time in this year, which would explain to students the importance of good sleep habits how to help school and sports, and how to improve their generality.
Paul Barreira, professor of science at the University of Harvard, and the health director of the university said that university decided to introduce this course after finding that students had been intimidated and very hard last week.
The course is going to take a long time to get involved in the work of dealing with.
In a Lieutenant, there's a room in the dorm where students click at coffee cups, curtains, teachers, and books are told about the consequences of caffeine and light, and sleep on the car, and the importance of regular sleeptimes.
In another Lieutenant, students will be described as long as fast as the risk of heart disease, depression, and cancer.
The map in Campus, with a response icon, will encourage students to think about their daily lives.
'We know we can't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as you have the right to know about the health effects of cigarette smoke, Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in 'Howl is still in the late night,' he says, modern technology and pressure increases in students shows that a great problem of sleep.
To make sure that you have enough sleep and good quality should be 'the secret weapon of students to fight stress, weakness, and anxiety, he even said to avoid weight, since the drowsiness would make the brain go into hunger and make it hungry all the time.
The 19 - year - old California student was studying chemistry and physical biology, helping Professor Czeisler designed a course of his course last year, during his school in Harvard.
He said that this course would help him to light his eyes and to give him the strength to push this course to all Camipus.
The next step is that he was hoping to be able to request every graduate student in this same program before going to any competition system.
Professor Czesler suggested that students should consider time to wake up when time to sleep, wake up, and be careful of the danger of the blue's light that releases out of the electronic screen and light light, which is a problem in bed.
Creston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga made Gole from Gerrard's send.
Rangers was hurt again when Dolly Menga made Streeks from the flinquerards and fell by 1-0 points at the liverton.
The Ibrox records his first victory all the time, from Tribet 4-1, in St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt found the second loss of Gerrard in 18 games, leaving eight points in Ladbrock Preservation.
Manga's in seven minutes before the first half and Rangers seem to be unable to snuck up again.
While Rangers is at the sixth level of วิตston, strangled in the third and away from Hibernian, only Gold.
And there's also more problems for Rangers when Calum Spence's investigation was wounded by the head of the object that was floating into the field.
Gerard decided to change eight players, and that made Ayr a great win, Betfred Cup.
At the same time, Holt is still the levi 11 player, which is the same focus on the หัวใจs and can fall into every match in Matt.
Rangers may have taken you all the time, but Clauston's in Taxing and making a point.
They had only two minutes of scores when Menga sent them to Scott Pitman through to Alan McGregor, making Gold, but Midfield could take it away.
Kaghan's freekik, Jacobs, helped send him to Kraig Halket, but his opponents fought against Alan Lithgow can be protected.
Rangers tried to control the game, but it seemed like it's a crazy hope to play the end.
อัลเฟรดo Morelos thought he was supposed to have a ten-five-five-minute punishment he'd fight with สตีเฟ่น Lawless, but the สตีเฟ่น Thomson refuses to deny the appeal ofโคลัมเบีย.
Rangers only coped in the first half, but Liam Kelly, the former Ibrox guard, was separated from Lasana Coulibly and made Ovia Ejari acque.
In 34 minutes, Livi opened the game, and no one can resist the run this time.
Rangers failed again in the defense of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield, there's no response when Declamp Gallagher sent to Scott Jackson, which can encourage Menga to close a beautiful game.
Gerard Sixak and Bullibly so thatไรอัน เคน could tear the wings out and send them to Morelos, but Kelly ran at the top of the birth.
However, Clauston still enjoys games with long-term teams from Lithgow and Halket.
Holt may have been in the last game, but McGregor blocked the scene before Lithgow ran from the corner.
Rangers turnedเกลน Middleton and found the blame when he tried to join ຢາໂຄບs, but Thomson missed again.
Almanac: Geiger Counter.
And this is the news from our "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, this same day when 136 years ago, and began counting... on the day of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm, which was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a way to detect and measure the rays, which have the invention that leads to the device called Geiger Counter.
Geiger Counter became the leading core of science, as in the 1950 movies, "Bells of Corondo," which led by Roy Rogers and DelFans:
"What is this device?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Counter can be used to search for radiation mines, such as Uranium.

Keny West, out of Pro-Hing Diatribe with his MGA hat, according to his SNL image.
That's not very good.
Kay West was fired in the studio during the nightday after the performance he showed the President of the United States, Donald Ching, and said, he was going to play politics in 2020.
After the third song of that night, where he was wearing a hat, he made the อเมริกา no more, he spoke to the Democret party, and repeats the support.
"A lot of times I talked to white people, and they said, "Why do you like the shrimp, he's going to divide the class?"
Well, if I opposed my class division, I would have moved out of the United States for a long time," he said.
SNL started to show up with Matt Damon, where the Holiwood star spoke funny about the Bret Kavanaugh investigation of sexual abuse, which was dictated by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though there's no publishing, there's an upload of news from West Sosian Media from funny Chris Rock.
Isn't it obvious that Rock tried to discredit West credit?
Likewise, West had to say to the audience that he had a problem with his hat in the back of the stage.
"They pretend to me on the back of the stage.
They said, 'Don't walk out with this hat.'
They pretend to me!
And after that, they also said that I was in the bottom position," he said, according to the news from Washington, intellect.
West says, "Do you want to look at the bottom position?" he said, "He's going to put my superman's coat, because this is a show that you can't tell me what I should do, would you want to push the world forward?"
Give me the love."
His words made at least two shouts of audiences and members of SNL were embarrassed, reports from those who were on the scene: "The whole studio was silent."

West surprises many of the music I do not know where he's dressed like a bottle of Perrier.

But the Tallock show that the West's a "Vide to his identity and great."
"But I choose not to salute someone (by buying his song or support his arts) who I believe that there is a danger in my community.
He's free to do that.
Like us," she added.
Before I started the show, Rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, and he was "the one known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed the doddy, which is known as Puffy, Puffy and Peddy.
My friends, Rapper Snoop Doggs used to be Snoop Lion, and of course, the Prince of myth music was changed as a symbol, and an artist known as Prince.

Max Waters rejected the accusations of the senator of the senator GP revealed about fraud and the collision of the sensitivity.
The U.S. Senator Maxine Waters has been denounced about her staff has been postponed about three of the United States's senators in front of the Vigipedia of the Inquisition on Saturday.
The Democrat Los Angeles said that this was investigated by experts and websites.
"All lies," said the Waters in Twitter.
The information published were available at home and phone numbers of the United States Senator Lindsey Graham from the South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
On the online day of Thursday, there was posted by individuals who were not given a name from Capitol Hill during the senator's trial of the congression of sexual misconduct against the government of the Buret Cavanaugh court.
This leaking data has been postponed after three qualified members questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservation site, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reports that IP addressing the source of posts is connected to Waters' office and publishing the information of the Waters report by Hill.
"The accusation without truth is all false, and of course, this is a lie," says the Waters.
"My staff's team, which has personal information, and security systems are affected by false accusations, and these lies are not responsible for all the leaks of this information.
This false accusation is all false, and it is certainly a lie."
Waters' statement was quickly reviewed online, including the former president of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection shows anger," wrote Fleisscher.
"This shows you don't have enough emotional sensitivity for a member of the congression.
When someone is accused of not doing something wrong, it doesn't have to be angry.
They don't have to respond.
They don't need to be interested in the motive of the accused.
They must be calm and conscious."
Fleischer compared the reaction of Waters to Judge Kavanaugh, a member of Democratic, who was accused of being too angry during the last Thursday investigation.
Omar Navarro, a member of the Republician party, saw the water in the middle of the season, expressed his mind in Twitter, too.
"Sorely, but true," he tweeted.

Let's review จอห์น English Strikes again.
Now it's common to look for the meaning of the Bringle, in any new movie that shows English's inclination, and it doesn't seem to be connected to the rehabilitation of จอห์น English, who started back in 2003, and the team came back in 2011, and came back to Johnny's second.
The new opportunity of exporting the country is possible just as much as possible.
In any way, he who has a funny ability to face the problem of a second contract, his name becomes a very large comicist, which has been designed for a nation that doesn't speak English.
Of course, he's a crazy spy, even if it's acting strange, but there's a shame of Cousoau, like Mr. Bean's death, and like for Chariots of fire, in London, 2012 for the Olympics.
He's still intimidating the world's personality when the Barclacard TV advertising is now unable to see it again.
With a good atmosphere in the last JE structure.
I like Johnny English when I'm up to the helicopter and wearing a armored shirt, and there's a fan in his helmet.
You know, there's a gift in a funny show, but it's not really funny, especially for movies like 007, and the Impossible มิช ชัน นารี, which is now a common funny line.
The sense of humor is a child, and for me, the adventure of Johnny English isn't very creative, and it's more likely to focus on the quiet jokes in the movie than, and it's a bean style.
The contents that often talk about each other are a lot of problems.
Cyber Hacker has been infiltrated into the Great Species of the kingdom, revealing the identity of all the agents in the kingdom to destroy the functional agents, which is a tragic role for Kevin Eldon.
The last line for the minister who was a snitch and a fighting man is experiencing an unresponsive political collapse: Emma Thompson was given as a quad-Tersa -- yet there's not a lot in the script.
Her intelligence consultant told her that when she exposed all the spies who were still working, she'd have to send them out of the country.
And that means that Johnny English, who is now a major teacher in a facility, but there's a learning lesson about the spy methods: with funny jokes, because English presents a rock school.
English has returned to Whitehall to listen to the conclusions in the emergency case and to meet his partner again by the bough that played by Ben Miller.
Buck now is a married young man who has a role as a submarine commander before, and there's a funny personality that's not appropriate for Vicki Pepperdine to pick this up.
For Batman and robin, who made a terrible mistake to protect the Queen, return to the throne again, take the title, take the valuary Kurylenko, by the beautiful Ophelia Bulletova girl.
At the same time, the minister is in danger under a special billionaire spell, which claims he can solve Britai's computer problem: Jason Volta, who took the role by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started with jokes: Aboriginal fire in French restaurants, they built a golar on Volta's fancy smuggling mission, and อังกฤษ tried to use the virtual ear to make familiar use of Volta's house.
There's a good story, but still funny and fun for children's TV show.

The laborers refused Britons' plans for four days a week, but they paid five days.

Turning into four days a week has been favored by the trade council and helped the employees benefit from this change.
The senior laborer source says to Them Times: 'Adventure will be given a review of the pre-year policy.
'This change will not happen in the past four days, but only four days a week, it's consistent with the way of the party to balance economic balances to workers, including the industry strategy, which includes the party'.
The laborers wouldn't be the first to allow this idea, but with the กรีนปาร์ตี้, asked for four days a week during the general campaign in 2017.
However, there's still no guarantee of the laborer.
The laborers said, 'Four days a week, not a party's policy, and the party will not be considered.'
The president of the shadow of John McDonnell used his last week's labor conference to define his vision for the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he intended to remove the power out of 'the Director' and 'the seeker' for the public health firm.
The Minister of Shadow is planning, but the present shareholder in the company may not be paid any more, since the laborers may have broken error.
Besides, he also confirmed that there would be a company worker in the board and build a Inclusive funds to give 10 percent of the private shares of the private company to the high-level workers to $500.

Looks like Kennedy's open more than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'm on my way to the investigation, and I told you, and I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this news, and asked, 'Are you real?'
He's certain. He's determined."
However, the vote of Graham's voice has been recorded for a long time.
"I've decided about Bret Kavanaugh, and I'll get a serious blame," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know: Brett totally rejected," Graham said more, reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the names of everyone you can't confirm.

I don't see any new changes."
What's the เทศกาล Global Citizen, and how does it have to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York is a superstition project, which is the most famous music show from the stars, including an impressive mission, not to lose, the end of poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year for the World War II, thousands of people gathered together at Central Park's largest lawn, not only enjoying the show, such as Janet Jackson B and Shawn Mend, but also to realize that the real purpose of this activity is to end poverty within 2030 years.

But the Global Citizen is the only success to achieve the goal within 12 years.
The idea of giving tickets to the free concert is just a way to convince people to act or to be another way called "clickivism," which makes people feel that they're actually making a real difference by sending online messages or sending them to the other side.
Global Citizen said that since 2011, there was more than 19 million activity from the supporter, pushing to create a different target.
These activities enable the world leaders to announce the connections and policys that are worth more than 37 billion dollars in the United States can save the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.

The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities, the government's calling for Mother and children, the government has a funding program for the Nutrutation program that will support women and children to five million children.
The answer to one of the questions that are often asked in the website, "What makes you think we can end severe poverty?"
"This is going to be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like the great citizen rights and movement against the previous surface separatists, we'll succeed because we have more power when we gather together.

"I believe we can share the view that energy can't be used as a tool to press, and the consumer should be able to pick the sappers," Alexander Novak, the Russian minister said after the meeting with Rick Perry, the president of the United States's energy minister in Moscow.
The United States's attitude caused severe reverence from Germany, which confirms the determination of this project.

Solid has made the user available to save their information and what people have been allowed to access information.
In interviewing Exclusive and the company, Berners-Lee said funnyly that your intentions behind the Inrupt were "the reign of Earth."
"We have to do it now," he mentioned that beginning.
"It's a time of history."
Such app using Solid technology to allow people to create a personal online data, or POD.
It can contain contacts that have to do the calendar, the library library, and private tools and other professionals.
It's like Google drives, Microsoft, Lack, and Spotames that are all available in only beaverzer and all at the same time.
What's special about keeping personal online data is that it's completely up to the user who can access any type of information.
This company is called "Prepacing personal powers through data."
According to John Bruce C.E., the company said the idea for Inrupt is for the company to bring resources, processing, and skills to help do Solid, everyone can use it.
Now this company is filled with Berners-Lee, Bruce Platform, bought by 1982, some regular developers have made a contract to work on the project and the community of volunteers.
This week, technology developers around the world can create an application from their own zeroes using an available tool to use on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't speak "Facebooks and Google" that whether they suggest a complete change, where all the business models of their business will be completely over the night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
Post one on the middle press published on Saturday, Berners-Lee said, "The work of the Inrupt is to provide the parachute energy and the Nile system to protect the image and the quality of the new Web site built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee turned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web companies at the Massquet Institute.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee had a strong voice in the middle of the Internet.
Even while opening up inrupt Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide site, the Web foundation and the open data institutions.
"I can't believe in the next version of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Venne: Victoria Cross, the first World War I celebrated.
The only church of the British priest who won Victoria Cross during the first world war was celebrated in his hometown 100 years ago.
A thousand Tomb King Bernard Vann received such a reward on September 29, 1918, in an attack at Bellinges and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by four days later, and he never knew that he had received the highest honor of the British army.
The memorial stone was revealed by his two nephew at the parkship inรัชden Northhamton on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandson, said it was a great symbol.
According to the London Council of September 29, 1918, thousands of thousands of thousands of soldiers led across the Chronde-Kinstein " through thick fogs and under the heavy firefires and heavy guns."
And then he rushed up at the shooting, and with the greatest courage, he took the shot before breaking the big gun by a single gun, and struck the three troops.
Colonel Tovann was killed by German shooter on October 4, 1918 -- just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's actions, "What I know I can't do, but it's something that's humble myself.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put the wheels behind the pavement that led by the young yothvatte of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said, "It's an honor to be involved in this tournament," and added, "The courage of the hero is actually shown by many supporters."
MMA's boyfriend's in the morning to see Bellator 206, they're back to Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine, you've been asleep all night to see Bellator 206 that's tight enough to be refused to see the main Eatt.
Bill from San Hoze has 13 Fits, including six big match, and live all night in the channel five.
At 6:00, while Gegard Moussi and Rory McDonald are preparing to face, the people in the United States even had to be shocked when the images changed into Pppa.
Some people don't appreciate it after they're asleep until the morning for this fire is only done.
A boyfriend on Twitter mentioned switching into a kid's comic, saying, "It's a boring joke."
"It's a precept of at 6:00 a.m., it's not appropriate, so they're going to change as a list of children."
"The pig girl," yes.
Scott Coker, president of the Bellator, says they're going to set up a schedule to include British audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about the show again, I think we might pass smoothly," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday there, and we can't fix this until Sunday, on Monday of their time.
But we're working on this.
Trust me, when you switch, there's a lot of messages back, and all of them are not friendly.
We've been trying to fix it. We think it's technical shortage.
But it's not. It's a government problem.
I promise you that next time will not happen.
We're going to keep it at five, instead of going to be six-- as we're doing normal, and we're trying to deliver too much to our boyfriend, and we just review it.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island discs: Tom Delly feels lesser in sex.
Tom Daley, a Olympic jumper said he grew up by feeling less than everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him the inspiration to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't think until he was up to high school, saying, "It's not everyone like me."
When he talked about fourวิทยุ, Desert Island first presented by Lauren Laverne, he said, he mentioned the rights of gay people to give "the hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent makes him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young Prosenter of a long list has been stopped for months of illness.
It seems like being floated in the first list of Laverne, เดล said that he felt a little bit lesser than everyone else who grew up because "It's not a society's approval to like a boy and a girl."
He said, "To this day, those feelings that feel little and different are really what makes me powerful and powerful to succeed."
He wanted to prove him "What special" he said so he wouldn't let everyone down when he finally knew about his sex.
The two-time copper medals became a LGBT campaign that people watched and used their appearance in this year's public game in Australia to attract more countries to the view of homosexuals as a crime.
He said he came out for a loud voice because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without breaking up and wanted to give it to others hope.
Three World Champion says that being in love with a man -- Dustin Lance Black, who was found in 2013 -- "for surprise me."
เดลy married the Oscar winner who was over 20 years older than he was last year, but he said that the difference was never a problem.
"When you've been through so many years old," he went to Olympic the first time when he was 14 years old and his father died with cancer three years later.
This couple became parents in June, whose son was Robert Ray Blackley, and Delie said, "All his attitude has changed."
"If you ever ask me last year, it's gonna be all about 'I'm gonna win the gold coin'," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than the Olympic gold coin.
My Olympic gold coin is Robbie."
His son's name was Robert, his father died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
เดลy said his father didn't admit he was dying and one of the last things he asked was that if they had given them a ticket to London in 2012, because he wanted to sit in front of him.
"I can't tell him, ‘ You're not gonna be able to sit in front of you," he said.
"I was waking his hand when he stopped breathing, and until he stopped breathing, and he finally died, and I admitted that he didn't remain there." he said.
Later, Daley joined the Olympics of 2012 and won the copper coins.
"I just know that this is what I've dreamed of my whole life -- to jump water in front of the crowd from home in the Olympics, there's no better sense of this."
He also made the first choice of his first song with the Hudel เล็ก -- which was famous to him to create up to the Olympics, and he still made him move.

Micleson's been sitting in the Rider Cup Saturday.
Phil Micleson, Americans make a new record on Sunday when they played Matt Render, his 47th Cup, but he had to turn his form back to avoid being an important event of grief.
Micleson played at the Evant two years for the 12th record, was taken by Jim Fryk, captain of the team for Fourballs and Fursms on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, while he was always going to the United States, five big winners divided his day during the cheerleading and making his game in the field, hoping to solve what he missed.
Not even a fair driver, even at the highest point of his career, 48 years of age, is not a very rich age of Le Golf National Park, where the longest path and accommodations have been over many different ways.
And if the field itself isn't enough enough, Micleson in Matt nine Sundays had to face Frenchsmoinari, the precision champion that joined the new ทอมมี่ Fleetwood team to win the entire four weeks.
If the Americans are down four points at the beginning of the 12 Machine, they're starting to get hot.
Furryk showed confidence in his people, not that he could say so much.
"He understood his role that had a full day claping at my back and held his arm on me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Fryk.
"He's very confident in himself.
He's the one who's been admitting that he's done so many of these teams in the past, and this week.
Maybe I didn't imagine he played two Matts.
I imagine more than that, but that's how it works out, and that's the way we think we have to do it.
He wants to go out there like everybody else."
Micleson will destroy Nick Faldo's statisticaldo for the most Mach Render Cup on Sunday.
It could be the end of his career, Ryder Cup that never fits the height of his personal record.
Micleson wins 18 times, 20 times, and seven and a half, but Fryk said he's bringing something difficult to explain to the team.
"He's a funny guy, he's a savager. He likes to play with people, and he's a wonderful guy who's in the team's room." he explained.
"I think the young player was enjoying him, too, this week, which was fun to see.
He gave me something more than just playing a lot."
Captain, the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the leading score might be gone soon.
Captain Thomas Bjorn, learned from experience that the last one of the last days of Ryder Cup, with enough lead scores that are about to make a really easy sick.
The Dane had opened up in the 1997 game at Valderrama, who was captain by the side of Sebibasos, had five advantages over the American team, but passed through the end of an unscrupiced nose.
"You always remind yourself that we were very ahead of Warderrama, we were very much ahead of Brooke that we lost and that Vulderrama we only won, but only "Bjorn," said the photo after watching the floor of 2013 5-3, and on Friday, to take up 10-6 Nationals.
So history will show me and everyone in that team that's not finished.
You're going to be so tired tomorrow.
Get out there and do all right.
This won't end until you score up on the board.
We have one goal, and that's what's trying to win this prize, and that's the point to focus on it.
I've always said, I've been focused on 12 players on our side, but we've realized what's standing across the other side -- the greatest player in the world."
I'm not going to do anything more than that.
It's gonna be another monster tomorrow.
Tomorrow is a single show to step forward, and that's what's going to be different.
It's wonderful to be there with Parker when things are going well, but when you're there one by one, you'll be fully tested as a golf player.
That's the message you want to send to the player is to bring yourself out the best tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your passport behind, and he must go and do the best."
On the contrary to the Bjorn across with Jim Fryk, he's gonna watch his players do better in the next person, except Jordan Stein and Justin Thomas, who scored three in the fourth.
Furryk himself was both the side of the final flipping, part of a team that wined in Brooklyn before the end of Europe made "the miracle at Medina."
"I remember every word," he said in answer when he was asked how Captain 1999 Ben Crenshhw brought his players to the end.
"We have 12 important match tomorrow, but you want to reach the start as soon as you see in Brooklyn, as you can see in Medina.
When that Momentum starts to pour out the only way, it's a lot of pressure on those middle Mattes.
We put our order rows in that way and bring them out in the way we feel like, right, you know, we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the lead in the back and confronted Rory McIlรอย in the highest mach, with Paul Casey, จัสติน Rahm, ทอมมี่ Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I agree with this group, according to the order, because I think it's covered in everything," Bjorn mentioned the single player.
Germany's new warship has been moved out again.
The last new Middle Force of Germany should be tried first in 2014 to replace a long-year-old warship, but it won't be there until the next year was at least because of a mistake and the capital at the local media report.
The first experiment of the "Rinland-Platinit" ship of the middle of the bar walking-whether-whetherbatburg, was moved out until the first half years of 20195, according to the newspaper Zeit, references from the Gonocock.
This ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problem after delivering a problem has caused the fate of an apocalypse project.
The submarine bar-wormburg, four of us at the Navy, bought back in 2007 to replace a very young Brackine.
It's understood that they're going to be installed with a powerful gun, a missile suit against aircraft, and against some invisible technology, such as the Rear Infrar and accomplice.
Other important qualities, including long-term treatment periods -- should be able to release a new middle ship for two years out of the local port.
However, a serial delay means that the ship at this modern technology -- which is said to make Germany shine the light of power over the country -- it's time when it's time to go to order Zeit.
The F125 warship that fate had been playing the news last year when the German army refused to test the ship and send it back to the Blohm and Vos in Humbark.
This is the first time the Navy sends the ship back to the captain after the transfer.
I don't know much of the reason behind the transfer, but the German media referred to a lot of "a lot of mistakes in software and hardware" that would make the ship useless if they let it go to war.
Software's mistake is very important, because the warship of Baw-Wormberg will be controlled by over 120 crews -- half of the forces in the middle of Bramin.
And it turns out that the ship has a lot of weight that reduces the power and limits the ability of the Navy to increase the future upgrade.
"Rynland-Platnet", the 7,000 tons, are convinced that there are double weights of the same submarine that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the missing hardware, the cost of all projects -- including the crew training -- it's also going to be a problem.
It's said that up to 3.1 billion Uro (3.6 billion U.S.) increases from starting 2.2 billion Uro.S.
The problems were at the last middle of the warship, becoming important when warning recently that Germany's sea power was falling down.
In the early year of Hans-Peter Bartels, head of Germany's defense committee, admitted to the real army, "It's not a warship that can be released."
The government said that this problem was a time ago, because the old ship was decrypted, but no new ship was replaced.
He's sorry that there's no military ship in the middle of the bar-wivertot Burk that can fit into the Navy.
The National Conservation Organization is listening to bats' secret lives.
The new research is being carried on the ground on Scott's high ground has purposed to reveal how bats use the country to hunt food.
I hope that this discovery can be a new understanding of the pets' behavior of this identity and guide the future conservation.
Educationed by scientists at the National Conservation Organization for Scottland will follow the soprano bat and the common bat, including the brown bat, and the daubenton bat at the Inverewe park in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in all the important points of the area to track the activity of bat all the seasons.
The NHS and the volunteers are going to run a flight by a cell phone detector.
The sound analysis of all the records will seek the frequency of sending bats and whatever species are doing.
The building maps and homes report are created to create a global ratio of their behavior.
Rob Diar, a natural conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that this result will reveal what's most important to this bat and being used by each species.
This information will determine the benefits of the home management, such as making the pasture and the best way to maintain the forest for bats and other species involved.
The bat population in Scottland and throughout the kingdom had fallen very much during the past century.
They're under threat to construction and developments that affect living and home loss.
The wind turbines and light may be risky, just like a bug paper and cures the construction materials with some chemicals, just like a cat attack.
It's a real bat and it's not blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch their victims.
They're using the techniques to identify a complex mirror to identify where the bugs and what's right in their airways.
NT, which is responsible for over 270 history buildings, 38 major gardens, and 76,000 hagtare all over the country, is very serious bats.
There are ten trained experts who are regularly operating in search of housing checks and assisting sometimes.
The organization also set up the first bat, and one of Scott's only bats at Threave Empty in Dumfries and Galloway, who live in the house of eight species of Scottland.
David Thompson, the manager said that this land is a rich area for them.
"Toreave, we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have an old building, there's a lot of trees, and a good home.
But there's a lot of stories about bats that don't know, so the work we've done here and the other land will help us understand more about what they want to grow out of your nephew."
He highlighted the importance of a bat before making the inside of the land, since only one species that could kill only a female and 400 small children who could clean all the local population.
The bats have been protected and illegally killed or harassed them or destroy their dwellings.
Elisabeth Ferrel, the Scottish Agent of the bat conservatory, supported the public.
She says: "We have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we don't know how bad the population is."
Ronald refused to accuse rape while the lawyer was ready to sue German magazine.
Cristino Ronald Do has been labeled the rape against him as a fake news, saying that people would need their own prototypes.
His lawyer's ready to accuse German magazine Der Spygel, who published such accusations.
Portugal and Yuventus were accused of raped American women, Katherine Las Vegas's room in 2009.
He was accused of paying you 375,000 dollars to keep the incident secret to Der Spiegel report on Friday.
Roando, 33 years old, reported on a live instagramfle, with a couple of 142 million trackers, several hours after the call was reported, and he said, "The fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they're saying today is the fake news, the winner of five times said before the camera.
"They want their own prototypes using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm all happy and good." The player said more, along with a smile.
Roando's lawyer is preparing to accuse Der Spygel about such accusations, which they called "the report of a suspicious privacy that can't be accepted."
The คริสเตียน Schertz, the lawyer said, "Acquisition in the amount of moral damage that fits with the weight of such rights abuse, which may be one of the most serious organism in the last few years."
Such accusations were mentioned in June 2009 at Palms and casinos in Las Vegas.
After meeting in the Night's Club, Narnoldo, and Marorka was reported back to the sports room where he was accused of raped her by the Twelvet, said according to the file file in the Klacquentian court in the state of Navada.
Myrka claims that Ronald Do came down on his knees after the incident, and told her that he was "99 percent" is a "good man" missing by "one percent."
That document claims Romano confirmed both sex, but it agreed to be together.
Myrka still claims she went to the police and took pictures of the hospital injury, but then agreed to go beyond the court because she felt "made response" and worried about "the shame of the public."
34 years old, says she's now going to find a way to flip down the ground because she's still smacking from an accusation.
Roando is going to join Realmadridge from Manchester U.S.A. during the time of overdestruction, and this summer is moving to the giant Juve of Italy with 100 million yero deals.
Braxith: The kingdom will regret forever.' to lose the car manufacturer.
If you lose the world's global leadership to produce cars after Brian,เกรก, business secretary says,
He added that it was a matter of concern that Toyota nationals had told BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a deal, it would have stopped the temporary production in Burnaston near Darby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese producer said that the cost of the border delay on the brakes, there's no deal that could lose the job.
The Burnaston factory which produced Aururis and the Avenis of Toyota -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if England was out of Europe at the end of March, we'd see the breakup in our factory," Marvin Cooke said the Toyota manager at Burnaston.
Another car manufacturer in the U.S. government gives fear of leaving the European Union without a deal of how to trade across the border, including Honda, BMW, and from the Larlandor Rover.
For example, BMW said he'd shut down a small factory in August Ford for a month after the brakes.
The main concern involves what the car manufacturer says is the risk of the chain on the incident that brakes had no deal.
The production line of Toyota works on the main "In time" with a shoulder in every 37 minutes, from the deliverer in the entire kingdom and European Union for the car order.
If the kingdom left the European Union without a deal on March 29, it could be stopped at the border that the industry said that it could lead to delay and shortage.
There's no way Toyota's gonna store more than one day at the Darbcher factory, and that's what the company said, and that's the end of production.
Mr. Clarke said that Teresa's chess plan for the future relationship with the European Union was “screamed carefully to avoid those checks at the border."
"We must have one deal, we want to have the best deal that I can make as I speak not only to succeed now but for us to take this chance."
"The evidence from not just Toyota but from other producers is that we need to carry on what is a very successful chain."
Toyota can't say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run, reminds us that more capital trees will eventually reduce the ability to compete in the factory and lose their job.
Peter Tsulvallis, who worked at Burnaston for 24 years, and became the senior of the laboratory at the factory, said, "In my experience when these work disappeared, they will never come back.
The government says: "We push forward to a very accurate and reliable plan for the future relationship with the European Union."
The Rump and Rosenstein meeting may be late again, the White House said.
Donald Trampp's high bet meeting with the High Prosecutor Rodsenstein's assistant may say, "Prested another week," while fighting was offered to be a member of Brot Cavanh, the White House said on Sunday.
Robert Muller, who's investigating Russian election intervention, connections between Russian assistant Rump and Russian and the potential justice.
Whether Rump's gonna fire the highest prosecutor's assistant, which will be dangerous for Muller's freedom, is oiling on the fire of Washington for months.
In the early month, The New York Times reported that Romansenstein spoke about the device to record the conversation with Trampe and the possibility to remove the president's 25th time to modify.
Rosesenstein refused that report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House in the report he was going to file off.
Instead of the meeting with Trampe, who was then the United Nations in New York was announced on Thursday.
Thamps said, "I like it more than not," drove Rosenstein out, and then the meeting was late to avoid fighting with the council committee that Kavanh and a woman who accused him of having committed sexual immorality.
On Friday, Rump ordered an FBI investigation, a week of calling to Kavanh, making the entire council vote slow.
Sarah Sanders, the press secretary of Toramp showed up on Fox Newsweek.
And she said, "The day for that is not defined, it could be this week, and I can see that the pushing of another week is up to the other things that are happening to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to upgrade with the media."
Some reports will argue with that confirmation: Sanders didn't have the White House press since September 10,
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that there was no press conference was not due to "the attention from the audience" of TV reporters, even though she said, "I wouldn't agree with the fact that they were looking for attention from the audience."
And then she suggested that contacts directly between rump and media are going to increase.
"This president puts up a lot more questions than other presidents before him," she said, by saying, without saying, "We've already looked at those numbers."
The press will continue to happen, Sanders said, "If the media had a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it would be better to talk to me.
We've been trying so much to do that, and you've seen that we've done so a few weeks ago, and that's going to happen in the press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trampp is regularly accepted when leaving the White House or while attending the opening or the press conference with an honourable visitor.
The only single press conference is hard to find.
In New York this week, the president might have shown the reason to create a strange show and free time without care of any statute before they gather reports.
A happy minister wrote to the European Union at NHS Scottland about fear of brakes.
Happy minister wrote a letter to the European agent who worked in Scott's NHSland's office to show thanks to the country and bless them the same way after the brakes.
Jeane Freeman, a member of Scottishland, sent a letter less than six months in the United States to get out of Europe.
Scottish government has been determined to deal with the capital of advocating status for the Europeans of the European Union who work in public service.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "This summer, the negotiation between the United States and the European Union is about to move on to the decision that was expected in this fall.
But the U.S. government began preparing for a possible unstable deal.
I know this is gonna be a terrible time for everyone.
That's why I want to remind you now that I'm evaluating every member of every member of the staff, whether they have any sense.
The colleagues from all over the European Union, and besides, take experience and skill that contributes strength and developments to health services and profits for patients and communitys that we serve.
Scottland is really your home, and we really want you to stay here."

The foreign buyers will be harvested up high-packs when they buy property in the kingdom.
The foreign buyers will be storeed up at a higher bartack when they buy more property in the kingdom with more cash to be used to help homeless people under a new plan.
Such movement will be against the success of Corbin's power to influence young elections.
The trial will be called from a man who doesn't pay taxes in the kingdom.
The department of the storehouse was expected to store 120 million pounds per year to save the homeless.
The foreign buyers are starting to get a higher wage when they buy their property in the U.S. -- with more cash to be used to help the homeless, Teresa Maye today.
Such movement will be viewed as an attempt to resist the success of Jeremy Corbin to pull up a less-year-old vote voice with a promise to provide more wages and targets at a lot of income.
The Attacks will be called from ordinary people and non- tax taxpayers in the kingdom with extra cash to increase the government's verge of a severe sleep.
More money -- which is more from the current counterpart, including the higher level, was introduced two years ago in the second house and bought a rent - could be three percent higher.
The department of the collection expected that this would raise 120 million pounds per year.
About 13 percent of London's new assets were bought by non- British residents, pushing the price up and made the buyer get the first place more difficult.
Many rich countries -- especially capital -- became "A ghost" because many foreign buyers would spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy has only been a few weeks after Boris Johnson called to reduce the asteroid to help the young man own their first home.
He accused a large construction company that drew high price by taking the property, but he didn't use advantages and urged her to stop her from using Koyota in his house to fix "the shame of England's house."
Mr. Corbin has announced the cripple that kicks the eyes of a home-construction that includes rent control and dissection of "no sin."
He still wants to add power to the council to build a new house.
Mrs. May said, "I said last year, I would dedicate my minister to rehabilitating English dreams that this life would be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
England always opens wide for those who want to live and build life here.
However, it's not right to be easy for those who don't live in a kingdom like the foreign companies to buy houses, as well as those who live in England who work hard.
For too many people in their own dreams, the house is too far away, and the shame of a hard sleep is still true, too."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest pride is to handle Scottland'.
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said, "The highest pride" is his manager of Scottland.
Scotts, 42 years old, are enjoying the challenge to recover North-Est clubs, who are now sitting at the third level in Lexon, from the third point.
He moved to St. Mayorren's office in the summer after taking St.M. Marine back to Scott Premierchip in the last year.

The milk machine compared with the mothers and the cows to the world online.
A company that pumped through online comments that compared to breast milk and cows who were milked.
To identify the opening of what was said, "The milk pumped in the first uncovered voice," the Elvii technology company released the commercial that was inspired from Musquestic video videos to express the freedom that a new pump can be shown to the mother who showed up.
The real mother danced in a cowhouse with a dry grass to a song, saying, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail." And in case you don't notice, these are not breasts. They're my breasts."
The cry continues: "Bing it out, pumping it out, I'm feeding them, pumping them out, pumping it out, I'm fixing my girl."
However, such a commercial that was distributed on the Facebook page, the company caused the Prague on Earth online.
With seven7,000 times and hundreds of comments, such videos have been answered that mixtured from the audience, many people say, "It's a horrible thing" of milk industry.
"It's a terrible decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and to produce milk, except for their children who are stolen from them within a few days after birth; there is one written.
Elvi's milk pump is fitd with a bra for the baby (Elvii/M).
Another comment: "It's an understanding wound for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise at the milk pump for your mother who's got their little child?"
Others add: "Adman's not mind."
People are out to protect the commercials by a woman who admitted that she thought it was a "crying" song.
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'll find one if I still give you milk.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I assume it's like this.
This is another genius product.
Another comment: "This is a fund, focused on the horsemen at the pumping (in the office or in the bathroom) and it feels like a cow."
This isn't a advertiser, or judge the milk industry."
In the end of the women's video, it turns out that they're all dancing with the milk pumps hidden in your bras.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the basis of a lot of women at the milk station saying that they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie station is quiet, there is no wires or pipes, and it fits in the bras, giving the girls free to move, carry their babies, and even outside the milk station.
Ana Balarin partners and E.C.D. at the comment: "B.I.V. is the product of a revolution that deserves to open up for five examples and appeal.
By dragging a parallel between the show of a woman and a chronome, we want to testify to all its milk and challenge as it shows how fun and access to the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump can get.

According to tradition, most of the fosters are unresponsive to themselves and are afraid to risk their own ability to stay in the country by taking a child's possession.

" Almost 80 percent of those who are fostered or members in the house of the helper here in this country are illegally illegal, and most of them are criminals.
So we're still following these people," said Mr. Allenz.
To find a quick way to get the kids through the process, the authorities offered a new rule to make some of the children appear in court within a month after being controlled rather than 60 days, which was the standard references from the rest.
Many people will appear through the video conference instead of coming by themselves to ask for their legal status with the judge of the city.
Those who have been considered inappropriate for the comfort will be deported quickly.
If the child is still under control, they'll be more concerned or depressed, which may lead to a violent or attempt to escape from the shelters and reports that come out of the system a few months ago.
The supporter said that these concerns are increasing in a larger place, such as Tornillo, which is a sign that a child who has a struggle tends to be overlooked because of the size of it.
They added that moving children to dance without enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends might cause a lot of wounds in their hearts.

It's been ten years since the southern part of New York City has been executed for the last death sentence.
Remember, Khalid Barnes was punished for killing two of them, but even the last time they were sentenced to prison in September 2009.

He said to the interrogator that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Sypov told the authorities that he was inspired to cause attacks after watching the video Iiss, several videos on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also asked me to show the IV flag in his hospital room.
He doesn't admit to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the middle lawyers who represent the cypovs, said, "It's very disappointing," and the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think that the decision to execute more than to accept the responsibility to ask for life in prison without a release will only stretch out the wounds of these events to everyone involved."
Sypov's team has asked the prosecutor not to try to kill him.
Tory MP said that NIGEL FARATE should be treated as a negotiation negotiation, brakes.
Nigel Farage sworn to move the masses today during the Tory conference.
The former president of the U.K. says that politicians must feel heat from the European Union -- as a member of Teresa Mame himself, he was supposed to be responsible for the European Union.
Peter Boun, the conservative, said that the march in Buringham's State is supposed to be gone.' Now if you're Farage as secretary of brakes.

Mr. Boun said that out there means rally out in solihu, he'd want to throw Chevers.
He suggested that Farage should be set up as a colleague and responsible for his negotiation with Russell.
"If he gets in, we'll get out now," he said.

We need to build our own laws in our own country.'

Andrely Jenkyns, the Tory Brackets are on the march, too, the reporter says: 'I'm just saying: 'Morder Minister, listen to the people.
"Chevers are not popular with the general people, but they don't vote for it, it's not popular to our party and our activities who really set down the road and make us pick in the first place.
Please put the checkers down and start listening.'
In a letter to Mrs. May she added: 'The ministers can keep their work when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage said a politician must find a voice ' feels the heat' if they're betraying the decision to go down to the year 2016.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us -- people -- and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Blaket, and we're here today to tell them, 'We're not going to let you survive by doing that.'
In a message to the crowd, he added: ‘ I want you to make people of our political class, who are betraying brakes, feel the heat of the heat.
'We're moving the army of this country, which gives us victory in brakes, and will never rest until we become a free kingdom that ruled himself and proudly proudly.'

Russian Granperance: Luvis Hamilton near the world after the team sent him to victory over Sebustte Fetttle.
It began to be clear from the time Valtteri Bottas passed before Lucifer Hamilton on Saturday at the Merces team was going to compete in most of the competitions.
From the Bottas pillars started well and nearly let Hamilton wait until he protected his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team.
Vettel went to Pittt and let Hamilton run in the back of the pack, what should be the decision.
Mercedes ran around one of the later and fell behind Vettel, but Hamilton was able to come up after the wheels that saw the Ferrari hesitated to let the side of the space risk the position after two shifts to protect the third corner.

It's a hard day because Valtteri did great all weekends and was a real gentleman who told me to come with.
The team's working a great job like this to get a punch, Hamilton said.
That's a really bad body language.
President Donald Trampp mocks Senator Dian Feinstein in the conference on Saturday, where she didn't stand her letter from Cristsy Blarsey Ford, who accused Bret Kavanh, who was offered the highest court member of sexual abuse.
The president of West Virginia was not directly mentioned in Ford's statement in front of the Senator committee, instead of showing that what was happening in the Senate shows that people were being "cluding and dishonest."
"The one thing that can happen and beautiful is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and narrow and disgusting and unbelief," he said.
"When you look at news and release, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the leak?
Remember her answer... did you release the document leak? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leave the leak."
All right, wait a minute.
We leave the leak or not, we don't let the leak out," he added by the senator's mockery.
Feinstein was sent to a detail of charges against Kavanh by Ford, back in July, and it leaked out earlier in September -- but Feinstein refused to leak out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't release her story." Feinstein told the board The Hill report.
"You asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret as you asked."
But her rejection doesn't seem to please the president who expressed his opinion during Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that's really a bad language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that's the worst physical language I've ever seen."
The operation of protecting his high court member who was accused of sexual immorality by three women, the president suggests that Democratics used such accusations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to take the power back in any way necessary.
You see narrowness, they don't care who's hurt, who they're going to step on to get power and control," reported the president's words.

Airnuni said in the news that at Saturday afternoon, it could not explain a man's passengers.
Airline says that it's working with local government, hospitals, and interrogators to find the man.
Such airlines are not responding to more details about such passengers immediately, such as his age or his instincts.
The local ship saved the passengers and other crew after the plane crashed the water while trying to land at Chuk Island.
The officer said on Friday that there were seven others sent into the hospital.
Airline said that six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in danger.
What caused the fall and the order of a certain event is not clear.
The airline and the Navy, both the United States, said that the plane had landed in the lake with a short runway.
Some of the Witnesses thought the plane ran beyond Runway.

Donald, the United States Justice Department of Justice, พอล Rowlett, has been given several hours as a witness for intelligence experts.
He concluded that he used a cell phone record to connect to the movement of 29 years old, Quinton Tellis and Jessica Chambers 19 years old, who was victim in the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had received a lot of data from a cell phone that showed that Tellis was with Chambers at the evening of her death, which opposed his former claim, Clarion Ledger.
When the information shows that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with Michael Sanford, his friend, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford got up on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "You lied because my truck was in Nachville."
Another notion is Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records indicate they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said sometimes after the death of Chambers, Tellis erased the phone call and the Chambers from his phone.
"He erased you from his life," said Hale.
The defenses were set to start closing the argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to come to the jury later that day.

The Paddington press fears the reader don't understand the bear talking.
Karen Jancel's daughter Bond, who was born after this book recently accepted such letters: "It's hard to care for someone who was reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Padddton."
Saying your father who used to work as a camera BBC before inspired to write a child's book with a little bear, it would be a joy that his work was denied, she added the 60 years of publishing the book " Sweet" after his death last year.
Paddton's, who she explained, "The most important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of the success that finally happened silently.
"He's quite quiet, and he's not a boaster," she said.
"But since Padddington is real to him, it's almost like you're having some successful kids: you're proud of them even though it's not your actions.
I think he looked at Padddinton's success quite that way.
Even if it's his creation and his imagination, he'll always give him credit for Padddton himself."
My daughter is dying, and I have to say good-bye through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was sent to LouisPerce's two hospitals, where the doctor worked in vain to save her life.

I'll be with her soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctor gave her to keep her heart pumping, slow down, slow down, and out of her system.
She died a while ago, and this is when all shut down.
I have to sit there and wait, knowing that this is coming out.
I can't scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it."
At last, Mrs. Ednan- Laperouse, which is now regreting losing her daughter, getting on a plane with other passengers -- I don't know what the pain you're going through.

A sad woman postcards to protect suicide on the bridge.
Two women who lost their love for suicide are working to prevent people from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey got a card on the Wells Bridge with an inspirational message and phone number that people can call support.
Tyler, 13 years old, David's son, when he started having depression and suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I am today," she said.
The 45-year-old Davis who lived in Lydney said that her son was a good chef with a good smile that sent together.
"Everyone knows him because of his smile.
They always say that his smile shines in any room."
Anyway, he fell off his job before he died while he was really in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he finished his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be a knock on the impact."
Mrs. Davis built a card, so that people out there can go and you can talk, even if they're friends.

Brett Kavanh's future, of course, is going anywhere when the FBI begins to investigate.
"I think, if we could get something like what he really asked -- the investigation was limited in the boundaries -- we could bring a little peace," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid he'd be broken in the middle of a tight company.
Why did Kavanh and the Riveli party want the FBI to interrogate?
Their unwillingness is from time to time.
It's only five weeks away from November 6, if it's as expected, the Republicans are not good, they'll be very weak in their efforts to get people who want to choose to go to the highest court in the land.
George W.B.E.E.E.E.E.O.D.O.O.D. has picked up a phone call to the Senator Lobbie, and they support Mr. Kavanh who works in the White House to Mr. Bush and through this guy who met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's private secretary.
What's going on after the FBI's report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, now 51 Republicans and 50 Democratic 49 people in position.
Isn't it obvious that Kavanh could at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would make the president's Penance Vice Vice Vicess always fall from and confirming him to the highest court?
The number of North Korean brushers fell' under Kim.
The number of deputies from North Korea has been down since Kim Jong-eun came up to power seven years ago, the South Korean Lawman said,
Park Bong-seug, quoted from South Korea's International Department, said that there were 1,127 times in the last year -- with respect to 2,706 times in 2011.
Mr. Park said that more strict control of the border between North Korea and China and the increase-carry rate is important.
Pong-Yang didn't show any public opinion.
Most drivers of the north will finally be offered to the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 Koreans across illegal border since the end of Korea in 1953.
Most of them run through China, with the longest border to North Korea and cross, is easier than the DMZ district, which has been safe between both Koreans.
China is more illegal immigrants than refugees and often force them to send back to countries.
The relationship between North and South -- which is in techniques of war -- has been made very clear in the last few months.
In the early month, the leader of the two countries met at Pyngang to talk, highlighting the unresolved nuclear weapons.
This happened after the history meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong- Eun June in Singapore, when they agreed in a wide constraint of the Korean Peninsula in the nuclear weapon.
But on Saturday, the North Korean minister, the North Korean minister, the Young-hoe against the United States's oppression from the lack of progress ever since.
"If there's no confidence in our nation's security and under this situation, there's no way we're going to disarm the only one."
Nansi Perlose called Bret Kavanh, said he was not supposed to serve in the highest court.
Nansi Perlose, a small council leader, called the highest court member, Brot Kavanh, said, "The Punctuaries of pie," and he said he's not right because he's in the mood to serve in the highest court.
Plocie showed the comment on Saturday at Texas Tribune, in Ostin, Texas.
"I can't wait to think that if a woman shows up like that, they'll say, 'You like to beat pie'." Plocie mentioned her reaction to Kavanh's statement against the Council of Thursday.
Kavanh refused to accuse him of sexual immorality, Dr. Christten Blasseyford, when they were both teenagers.
During his opening press conference, Kavanh wears a lot of emotions, sometimes nearly shouting out and scooping while talking about his family and his high school life.
He also condemned the Democratic party of the board, calling against him "resolved characters and coordinated" who were held by the liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton, lost the president of 2016.
Plose said she believed that Kavanh's statement had proved he couldn't serve the highest court because it showed him his attitude toward Democratics.
"I think he's cutting himself off with those words and patterns, how he beat Clinton and Democratic party," she said.
Plose asked if she would try to sue Kavanh if he had been confirmed, and if the Democrets had heard a lot of voice in the council of the royal court.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the Congrass or the FBI, he's not just in the highest court, but in the court where he's in now," said Plosi.
Kavanh, now this is a judge in the D.C. court.
Plocie added that as a Democrat party, she was worried about Kavanh's judgment that might have happened to health-ACA law or Roe v.V.D. as he was considered to be a fair constitutional.
In listening to his confirmation, Kavanh avoids the question, whether he turns the judge's judge or not.
"It's not the time for people who beat pies and don't like to go to court and expect us to say, 'How wonderful it is."
And women need to be armed.
It's been a fair critics for months of a flooding anger, and she can't speak without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," said Mrs. Steinem. Say to me in 45 years later.
"I don't think it's wrong, do you think?"
She said, "I've been a lot of help from a woman who said she was crying when she was angry, but developed a technique, which means that when she got angry and started crying, she'd say to the people that you're saying, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I think that's great."
tears have been allowed to be a way out for some anger because they have been wronged in basic ways.
One of my most sharp memories from the first work in the man's office, where I once found myself crying with a anger that can't explain, that I was taken by a woman who was older than one -- a cold manager that was always afraid of me to go to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry with firewood.
They think you're sad and you're happy because they won you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Democratic Council of the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his president's office.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested on the shipship of Monkey business and curved out of the race, the Schroeder, who was deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason why she shouldn't try to explore the idea of the president's position on his own.
"It's not a good decision," she said to me with laugh 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they want is another one.
Some call it Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.
Because it's the end of finding, she's behind the funding, so she swears she won't join the competition unless she's going to fund for two million dollars.
It's a fight that's allergic to lose.
She found that some of her supporters gave her 1,000 dollars with a guy would give her only 250 bucks.
"Do they think I've got a lower part?" You wonder.
When she announced that she wouldn't open her campaign, she was overwhelmed by her emotions.
"You think I don't have a nerve," miss Schroeder reminds me how the press react to her.
"You think Kleenx is my organization's Spunzer.
I remember thinking about what they're writing on my gravestone?
"Are you crying?"
