Indonesian Suna and an earthquake destroyed a island by killing hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, the foreign authorities were told that they would not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their home, it was not a national disaster, but a need for international help.

In the next year, Mr. Joko's lack of money has made his reign bitter.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from the sectarian problems that have fallen in Indonesia, and the majority of the country's Muslims are urged to follow the more realistic pattern of faith.
In the streets, more than 1,000 people were killed and thousands lost their homes after the Christian gangs and Muslims had met with fires, bows, arrows, and other deadly weapons.

The victory of Living Stone 1-0 against Rangers in Menga's Gollum.
Dolly Menga of Liingstein led the first Golla team to the victory
As the manager of the Ibroks Club, Steven Gerade gave the second failure to 18 competitions, and Rangers was shocked by the Lingestton.
The Holt’s team was relocated and Hyberian became a secondary position, so Dolly’s Menga became a different team.
The general team continues on this point without success on the premiere, and on the next Sunday, we must meet Hartz, the world's 8 pointer than they are.
Before that, Rapid Vina is hosting Rangers on Thursday in Europe.
In the meantime, their unforgettable turbulence in Division has spread to six sports, and the former trainer, Kenny Mill, hasn't yet tasted Holt, the new schoolmate who has been given a month's replacement.
Living Stone wasted the best opportunities the visitor gave.
The Holt's team had to be very forward before Goll, because Rangers had all the problems facing them.
Scott Robinson has been killed by the opposing team, but the effort of the Scots on the Golle has been in vain, and Alan Lit Gaw and Gould have been shot in the face of the ball, but Craig Halkee's head back.
We should say that the guests, who we knew, were able to squeeze the visitors through their exhibition in the Middle East, were content to allow them to play rangles in front of them.
That's how this important tower was born.
Rangers surrendered to a frequency, and the Linging Stone tried a operation, along with Deklan Galagus and Robinson, brought the money to Menga, and Mangala, and won the ball from the box.
During that period, the balls were the Rangers, but the support of the host team was unsuccessful, and the Golem Kelly stood still.
Alfredo Morelles was in a dental state, but this method continued to be half the same.
Scott Pit Man has tried to roam, but Rangers hasn't yielded, and Lieutenant's style has gone out of the open mine, but the ball is gone.
Although the crosses were constantly coming to Lington's box, they were all gone, and the two penal claims of Hand Bowl were rejected by the Holocaust, claiming that Glenn Midton was shown as a substitute.
From Livigenstein - analyst.
Alas deer Lamond of the BBC Scott Lanter in Irania, Tony Makróni.
A legendary demonstration and the result of Livigenston.
As they continued their journey to the top, they kept their eyes focused on the prospects.
After returning to their frontiers, the game changed the style or teams, but when he got to his place, the team must be commended for being held together by the Holt.
The Holt had a lot of leaders.
The Captain Halket took great advantage of keeping the defenses prepared to be kept in order, and the Mennonites kept the Coordinates and Joe Worral throughout the game.
Rangers had the impediment to fight.
When they were under the garage, they played with great joy, and they went down from that level.
They didn't have the energy, but once they could reach the tower of the host team, Rangers is a competition for warning because they're now downstairs.

The threat of the Rosa Hurricane Finnix, Los Vegas, Salt Lake, and the threat of the Rosa Hurricane
Arizona has an unusual resurgence, but at the beginning of the next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa storm is in the southwest wilderness, this is exactly what will happen.
The National Weather Services has warned that there will be a sudden flood of waters, including Finnix, Flag Stuff, Las Vegas, Salt Lakes, and the city, from West Arizona to Easter Nevada, Southern California, and Yucatán.

In other parts of the southwestern desert, including Central Rockies and Great Bass, there may be 1 to 2 inches of rain, but the total amount of rain falls.
The rain that comes from Rosa can become a blessing in the matter of unsafe regions of overcrowded floods because the area is facing severe droughts.
Although the flood is a serious problem, the rain is likely to be beneficial because of the weather conditions in the South West.

Then, before we reach the borders of Arizona on Tuesday, a tropical storm will move across the north of Mexico, then through Arizona, to southeastern Yuta, on Tuesday.
"The major accident expected from Rosa or from its remaining strength is the heavy rain that comes from Baja California, North-west Sonora, and US Desert South West," said National Health Center.
It is hoped that there will be a sudden flood of life, floods in the desert, and muddy soil in the mountainous regions.

Rapper calls his name 'ye'
West converts Rapa Nui into his name.
On Saturday he wrote in Twitt: "The official man who is known as the West."

It's expected that he's gonna get his new Alba, Yandi, on this show.
The Creator of the show said that Ariana Grant, who went out of the show for emotional reasons, was coming to West.
Wessel had already said that this word is not just a new name but that it is a religious significance for him.
I believe it's the most common word used in the Bible, but it's "you", and it's the same way when we discuss his name with the radio host Big Boy.
"That's why I am you, I'm you, it's us, it's all us.
I went to you from the Virgin, which means it's the only one that's our reward.
This album reflects who we are."

We must double the US financial support of artificial intelligence.
Since China is becoming more active in technology, he's investigator and the AI projector, Kay-Fu Le, who has worked on the Google, Microsoft, and apples.
Even if the U.S.A.'s official policy does not exist, Kay-Fu Lee said that after all the U.S. government proposed a series of executables.
Last year China made a plan, intending to take the first step toward the new site of 2030.
"When you consider the fact that all other countries are behind the U.S., it's a good start to double the AI research budget, and we're looking forward to what is next to AIDS."
To double the financial aid, Lee told CENBC in a week interview that the next major AC will likely be U.S.
"AI super Powers, China, Silicon Wali and the New World Order." Lee published a book published by Hoffton Mifleen Horror, now the CII of Sionwears CI, the most important AI company in China, Fas++.
In 1980 he built an AI system at Carniki Lelen University, where he defeated the U.S.A.R., and then worked at the Executive of Microsoft Reserve and the president of the Chinese branch of Gulu.
The U.S. government, like that of the Defense Advent Project agency's robotics agency, admired the influence of technological competitions, and asked if the next technological team would ever be able to connect.
Lee said that the U.S. researchers often find it difficult to provide financial assistance.
"It's not China that takes more people than Academy," said Lee.
Face book and Google and other technology companies have been assigned to those who have successfully succeeded in working with the AC in the United States in recent years.
Lee said that the U.S. A.A. attempts would be able to help the colonial trades to support the U.S. efforts.
"I think those who take the PHD should naturally get a Green Card," said Lee.
In July 2017, at the Chinese State Council, its Nect Generalal Oriental Development Development Plan was launched.
Just as the National National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide financial assistance to US researchers, China’s National Science Foundation and the Academy of Academy are providing financial assistance to people in the United States, but Lee said that the state of academy in China is low.

In a public test of the Republic of North Macedonia, the Macedonian nation voted on Sunday for the renaming of the country, which was intended to find a solution to the conflict between Greeks and Greeks, so this conflict was interrupted by the Macedonian request for a member of the European Union or Natto.
Since there is a province of Macedonia in Greece, Greece takes the name Masedonia, their northern neighboring country, as it is called, and the requests of the Macedonian dynasty of Nato and the European Union ceased by means of their own power.
In June both countries had come to an agreement with the new name, but if the national anthem is reputed to be reputed, the denomination of the people of Macedonia would weaken the genocide of the Slavic nation of Slavic.

"Do you agree with the law of the Nato and the European Union, by the consent of the treaty with Greece?"
According to a group of scholars, including the prime minister Zoran Saiev, Macedonia is one of two countries that grew from the west of Yugoslavia.
"I'm here today to vote for the country's future, so they can live independently under the European Union, and the European Union means that all of us are more secure in life."
Although not legally established, all members of the parliament said that the results of public examination would be followed.
The renatal needs two thirds of the parliament.
The State Electronic Commission said there were no reports of instincts until 1 o’clock.
However, when 66 percent of the voters registered in 2016 were voted, 36 percent of the votes per hour, compared with only 16 percent of the public’s votes.
"I'm here to vote for my children, Europe is our place," the capital of Skopje jel, the vator, Joseph Thanksky Sky.
On September 3018, in Strucca, Macedonia, the prime minister of Macedonia, Zoroan and his wife, Saraika, and son - in - law, were voted on a public expedition in Macedonia that opened the way to join Nato and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 50 - year - old Vladimir Quardaov would have a small strategic setup in front of the deportations.
"We don't oppose our joining Nato and the European Union, but we want to join our heads, not through the door."
"We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can ask for help in China or Russia and become part of the European-Asia Institute."
The Prime Minister Seyev says that the investment of Macedonia, over 20 percent of the population of unemployed, will bring the Nato membership.
"I believe that most of our citizens will support the most, because 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and Natto membership." After the vote, Saeve said, "
He said, "The result of the "to come" will be the confirmation of our future."
According to the Institution for Polynesy Research of Macedonia, 30 percent of the voters between the world’s population are involved in a public examination of 43 percent, but it is less than a percentage needed.

In a Saturday competition at Ethhaad Stadium in Manchester, England, the victory of Manchester 2-0 Scouts, Sergeyo Aguru and Reheim Sterling built Britain’s defense line.
Aguerrea's towered in the sixth and fifth minutes, as easy as it seems to be.
In the beginning of this attempt, this Armenian Striker had passed pass by in the middle of the mile.
Before they hit the open market, three British defense players rushed into the air.
And then you see Aguvara is surrounded by four green Germans.
Aguvara pushed a defense player and ridiculed many defense players by laying the tower of Britain on his face.
On the left side, when Sterling was found, Aguerrea lost the ball.
May this English Forward, the ball returned to Aguerrea and then stole the right side of the net by robbing the American gold tower of Great Britain.
"Aguerrea has serious problems," and the city manager told the reporters.
"55, we told him about playing 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he's beating at that time."
But in the war of Premier Leg, Sky Blues was the first to give the start.
The tower was born on the 21th minute.

Shercek wants to play with Speller Versus Rockies.
Since the Nationals were expelled from the playground, there is no other beginning.
But Shergek Colado's always wanted to go to the game on Sundays, but it's real only if Roxier's mind is still on play.
Rockies defeated the Nationals on Friday night, 5-2, but they were trying to put their first disciplinary.
"Even if we're playing for no one, we'll get at least rabberry on our fingers, and we'll play at the height of any point I'm going to meet this year.
Why shouldn't I rebel?"
The Nationals have not yet declared a Star for Sunday, but it is possible to allow the Shercerere, who offered a fair presentation in such a situation.
Cheerser, who was ready to take the 30th floor, threw a bullet on Thursday, and he'd be in his natural rest Sunday.
The Washington Town Right-right Shercek has 220 2/3 of this seat with 2.3 of the Indians and 18-7 with a 300 - stack drive.
The Struggle to West Virginia
In discussing the importance of singing in the Republican Party in the future, the president reviewed the nominal state of Brett Coverau, his Supreme Court.
"What we've done is based on November.
One of the most important choices in our life is five weeks.
It's the biggest one, but I'm really rebelling, so I'm running everywhere, fighting for the great rebels.
The Tramp continued, "You see the terrible, terrifying, terrorists of the democrats, and you see what's happening right now.
They are determined to return to the rule by using any means necessary — a little repetition and degradation, as you see.
They don't have a eye on who they are being persecuted to gain power and control, nor do they have the power and control that they need, and we don't give it to them."
Trump said they were democratics on a mission to oppose and prevent.
"What do you see in the last four days?" The Trump asked, "Threats, filthy, simple, honest," criticizing Democratics.
When the St. Judiciary Commissioner Rening Democratic Center spoke of Diane Finstein's Trumpet name, the audience shouted.
"Do you remember their response?
Did you kiss the doctor?
Oh, no, no.
No, no, I can wait for it - it's really bad body language - the worst body language I have ever seen."
Labor Party is no longer a vast congregation.
It won't disturb those who say it.
I was not surprised when the authorities in my local party voted to warn me.
Besides, I'm the most new man on the line of Labor MP, which is said to be no welcome.
The same was true of my partnership, Joan Rie, who stood firm for the Anticellitis.
In my case, the lawyer's theme criticized me for dealing with Jeremy Corbin.
In a similar way, in such matters as financial security, national security, and Europe, Jeremy has been awarded to former leaders.
Saturday's notice for Ham Easter Labor meeting said, "We'd like to be embedded and salted."
During my eight years as a local Labor MP, the GC meeting on Friday nights was the same.
Sadly, it's not the nature of many meetings today, but it's been long past the promise of the more kind, even more gentle and political.
It has become more clear that no different views on the Labor Party can be considered based on whether it is acceptable for the role of the party.
It started immediately as Jeremy's leader, and my colleagues, whom I once thought would keep up with my own political views, hoped that I would travel against the opposite direction and would take the national security and the only proposed European Union.
Every time I preach to the public, I don't even consider what the subject is, I'm going to be on the throes in the community's media, and I'm telling some people that I'm going to be an imitator and I'm not going to have to leave the central political party.
It's not my only experience.
I'm most lucky than some of my fellow workers because the commanders on my front are related to political matters.
Every day I am proud of the promotion and determination of my fellow workers, who are sexually or racially or otherwise, but never will be ashamed.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this century of politics is that the status of the call is a natural event.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labor Party should nourish a culture of endurance.
In fact, we're not a vast congregation, every theme of "unbelief" or when changes of election are made.
I've been given a lot of advice over the past two years, and I don't want my head down and I don't want to talk so far.
But that's not why I'm here in politics.
When I was a schoolteacher 32 years ago, I joined the schooling party. My full - school classroom really moved me to show the kindness of the directors of the staff, and then, as a local council, as a minister or as a minister, I tried to offer further public services to those in need.
I've never forgotten my politics in any case, including the last choice.
No one in the Watching Ham Iss has any doubt about my ideology and the fields of my current interference with the present leader.
I just want to tell those who promote the theme on Friday, when the country is moving to the brakes that hurt houses, businesses, and our public services, I don't know how to waste time and energy in connection with my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party.
But I promise not to give me a real message but to give it to the Watching Ham Commander, not to Labor Party's followers and non-priests: I'm proud to serve you, whether I'm afraid of demolishing my status or of moving about, I'm not able to prevent me from acting in what I believe is the best way I can.
The MP in the lookin' home is Chris Lesley.
Air 38 - 17 Melroz: Without a toothpaste
Even though the two previous equations may have made the final result almost obsolete, it is certain that the Air was successful in today’s fascinating tenant Premieration competition.
These two teams in the 10th - dots are the topmost of the list.
In short, the best defense and their courage to put the team to the test were all right for the trainer Peter Marc to enjoy.
"Our ability has been tested in all the matches ever since, and they still don't know Folly, so I'm happy."
Melroz Robin Christi said: "The Messiah is the rightful owner of Aye, and they are the ones who stood up in testing the chances."
Grant Anders' Fourteen minutes of effort was aimed at Frescier Clemo, and this led to Ayer, but by means of Warriers, the icecard, which was given to the Scott Cape Rouge Hughes for competition, gave me a chance, but it didn't work for the Zeusen Baghet's attempt.
A penale brought him to Clemo Lead, and about half of the time before, Clemo had reached the goal of a solo, which at the time was to earn 17-5 percent.
But in the second half, Melros began to be well, and when Patrick Anders reached the goal of Bagbot, they were able to set up 5 points of score.
Because of the serious injury of Ryrid, the game lasted a long time, and when the competition was reinstated, he recovered the rumor, and he tried to take the effort of Storford McDowell, and Clemo reached the goal.
Then the temporary captain of Air was given a yellow card, and Bruce couldn't reach the goal of his chance of Melrow from the witch of heavy stress.
Even though the home seat has been reopened, in Penalty Linut, when Haychin received a yellow card for throwing the glucose away, Max Ferson tried to jump into the direction of the moving Air.
As Clemo did when he reinstated, he took it from David Amstrong and sent it to Gregoor Henri, near the Mith of Home Side.

The government throws a blue flag at the buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the naval bases are decorated with the same sealing: "The sea is ours according to the right."
It's a duty to restore it."
Throughout the 19th century, throughout the landed Bolivia, the memory of leaving their beach in the bloody environment of the 19th century remains unchanged and the desire to sail through the Pacific once more.
Although this hope has been held for decades, it's now reaching the age of old because Ok Tober has been expected to have a judgment from the International Court of Human Rights, and Bolivia has been doing its research for the past five years.
"Bolivia now has a form of warmth, unity, and peace, and the Kingdom hope for the future," said Roberto Kalzilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivian people in the state of large screens say that they hope to see with compassion the rights of the tribunal Bolavia in Haig, and after decades of statistical discussions, they consider it a duty to consider a way to go to Bolivia with full power to the sea.
He must face the debate of the next year's reconstruction of the country's official president Evo Moralis, who has the influence of Bolivia.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific Sea," he swore in the last August.
According to some surveys, the decision may not be justified in the case of Bolivia, for although the court supports it, nothing will happen.
This UN body, which is based on the Netherlands, has not been allowed to judge a subject of Chile’s Earthquake, and it has been defined as the result of events that are not determined.
In just six months after listening to the final arguments, the ICJ's fate suggests that the case was not "conscious" in the International Law.
Instead of taking the goal of Bolivia, events of the past four years may have turned out to be the goal.
"The Bolivian government has made the current problem of access to the sea," said Saradi.
The man who had been attacked by Morocco may have reasoned that the remainder of the good view of Bolivia might have been the one he had.
Bolivia and Chile will sometimes continue to discuss, but then it's too difficult to discuss.
Since 1962 both countries have not set up positions of authority.
The idea that the court’s decision was unusually faster was rejected by former president Eduardo Rodriguez Weltsze, a representative of the Bolivian Inquisition of Haig.
He said it's a wonderful opportunity to open a new age of Chile's relationship and to end 139 years of differences with the safety benefits.
The problem of the oceans is that Moralis is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America.
"Don't give up the right to get access to the Pacific Sea" he added.
"This fate is an opportunity to see what we need to pass through the past."

John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
The Free Schools of Scott London are taking care of a track record of Academyc Mica, and with another set of extraordinary tests, in 2018, it continued to make a personal and arbitrary success in poetry, music, and other communism efforts.
These schools, representing by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and learning more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are trying to give the students and their parents the best position of service.
The goal of free schools is to prepare students for higher education and their chosen careers and their position as global citizens.
As an educational field that can be developed and implemented, we see that in school, modern languages will continue to be popular and advisable.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a hearty language, it'll come up on his head.
But as he speaks to him in his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This reminds us that when she wants contact with people from other countries and wants to win her faith, only English can't rely.
From the recent experiments of this year, we can see that the Leg lists are languages that rise with the highest success of the schools of freedom.
A total of 68 percent of the students who have learned foreign languages have received a high grade.
The data collected from 74 schools in SCIS shows that 72 percent of the students have won the Hair A Grade in Mandarin, and 72 percent of the students who are taught German, 69 percent of those who learn French, and 63 percent of those who learn Spanish.
This proves that the free schools of Scotland support foreign languages as the primary means of denomination that children and students will need in the future.
As with free school curriculums and elsewhere, languages are now being considered as a matter of choice.
A survey of U.S.News & World Report found that 17 percent of the reasons why it was challenging to appoint petitions in the tens of thousands of tasks have been pointed out to be unfamiliar with language.
Thus, language skills are becoming even more important in preparing students for future employment.
Since languages are essential for future employment, these skills are indispensable in the world around the world.
If the kerar road is no longer available, if the employers have learned a second language, they will have a long - term difference in the future, and they will be truly ahead of them.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign lands naturally leads to the competition of a person who knows more than one language.
In 2013, according to the results of UK’s UK - 4,000 - year - old U.S.R., 75 percent of the people are not able to speak foreign languages so that they can start a conversation, and 15 percent of them say that they know the only foreign language.
That's why investing in language is important for children today.
Knowing more than one language, especially in developing countries, will give the children more opportunity to find purposeful work.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Other schools will teach that when you look for more classes in modern languages, like Mandarin or Japanese, you will be important to Yuke in 2020.
Whatever your child’s wishes, there will always be a challenge to choose from school where teachers are skilled in the foreign language.
Although we don't know what the future holds, the Scottish free schools are devoted to providing a study of the skills they need to prepare and make a success of life.
In a global business environment, it is not possible to deny that languages will continue to be an integral part of the future of the Kingdom, so it must be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages must be considered "international communication skills".
This choice, variety, and efficiency for Scott's children will continue in free schools.
Fair in the IIFTH Bin.

Lakr Singh will come to the Libron Game on Sundays in Sandygo.
It's a rest to wait for the worshippers who were expected to get into the game for the Los Angeles lottery.
In Sandego the coach Luke Wallden declared that James will play on the Pri-Cessen Operation Sunday in Denver Naggett.
But it's not been decided how many minutes James plays.
Walton said that the official Web site of Lakes will be more than a minute and 48 minutes less.
James's reporter, Mike Trodel Tweett, was playing only for a limited time.
After this first week of training, James was asked about Lacker's Sick-Geem Pressen Shede.
"I don't need Presson Games at this stage in the carrier to prepare," he said.
Tramp's West Virginia Railway time, YouTube Channel
Tonight, President Donald Tramp's peninsula is starting in Vlying, West Virginia.
It's the first of five railroads of the Tram next week, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
In addition to confirming his nominal vote for the Supreme Court, the Trumpet aims to further the people in advance of the future choice to take place in Nuremberg because the Republic Party fears that the Republic will lose control of the Congress.
What time is the West Virginia Rali taking the tram tonight, how can you see this online?
On Saturday, September 20, 2018, at 7: 00 p.m., the train was ready for the train in West Virginia.
You can see the Tramp's West Virginia Raili under youTube through the Stream at the moment.
The Supreme Court of the United States has to mention this week's trial by Brett Canao, that is, by the charge of sexual misconduct against the canvas, and the FBI's inquiry is postponed for a week.
But the main goal of these conferences is that the Republican Party meets the November election.
So, Rotterdre reports that the U.S. president's aim is to give energy to volunteer workers and followers because the Party is trying to keep and expand the majority of the Republican Party in the congregation.
"The control of the congress is very specific about President's Agent, so he will visit the stations as much as possible as possible," said a lawyer to Roiters, but the vice president refused to reveal his name.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, Rali on the night of the Wesban Coorna in Vlying will attract followers from the vanillas and take care of the Pittsburgh media.
Last month, Tramp West Virginia visited, and it will be a second visit with Rali on Saturday, receiving over 40 percent votes at the election in 2016.
Structs are trying to help Patrick Morris, president of the West Virginia Republic.
"It's not a good indication for the president to get ahead of Morris," said political scientist Simon Hayer at the West Virginia University, to Roiters.
Raider cup 2018: The team showed the fight to maintain hope when entering Singapore on Sunday
Three separate sessions may be Saturday afternoon's noon. This year the recorder cup was really necessary.
Even if the styles of the game are completely engrossed, the players actually believe it, especially in the games like this.
Where, then, are they now calling that foreword?
"They were six points ahead, and now four, so I guess it's a little turtle with us," and when the competition was over, Jordan Spite said.
Four points are for Europe ahead of the 12th race.
However, according to Spain, the Americans think that the wind is a little support for them and that it's a lot of courage for them. They're not too much to encourage the game of Spain and Justin Thomas.
Speeth, a deadly Green Tot, is in front of others in front of him.
After two games played, Spee and Thomas were behind two points, and the voices were louder when the competition was played in four o'clocks.
Fifteen - five winners were given the same celebrations that he said to the people that he believed the American team was not out of the game.
"You really need to know and be anxious about your own game," said Spett.
That's what's left for each player.
18 halls to prove Michael.
In the last two days, Francesco Molei and Tommy Fleitwood are the only player who has more points than Spain and Thomas.
These twins, however, are not wrong with the roots of Europe, which had four main objectives.
Saturday afternoon was the only pair that didn't take a bag shot, but they made Saturday morning morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine hotels were playing on Friday mornings and on Fridays.
They're the players to lose on Sunday, and the way they feel their energy flows from a sound -
It's better that both of you play different halls at a time.
However, speaking of the greatness of the Europeans remains a matter of the time.
During the morning, Sergeio Garsa, he played with Alex Norman, and Bubba Watson and Web Simpson dealt with a difficult situation.
One of the first nine halls, two doubles, the Spanish, and the Swedish were thrown into a mine that could not be seen.
But no one can get you out of the pit on Sunday.
The tradition between pairs, the teaching of each other, the teaching that they don't give to each other, the way that any trick may be done in a moment is very appealing to see from the closest to the forearms.
As a team, Europe's remodeled and played with a good lead for the last day, but this Forsames session, the team has shown that some people, especially the USSA, have a fight against their country.
Europe is 10-6 with the lead on the last day of the Red Cup.
On Saturday, Europe rises above the United States of Forbus and Forsams and goes to a healthier advantage for the last day of the Red Cross.
In Le Golf National, with two winners playing a game over the playerwoods, the final score of their scores in four points led to Tommy Fleitwood and Francesco Monique.
If Tomas Jorn's European, who tried to recover the Trophy in Haselt two years ago, that line reached 31 in Forbulls at night and established the government over the American Party.
The U.S.R. saw more opposition in both races, winning two races, but it couldn't be less.
If Jim Furyk's team wants to keep the crown on Sunday, eight points from 12 simultaneous games.
Flightwood is the first European new one that continues to earn four points, but he and Monique, called "Molywood" after a startling weekend, is the second pair of their first four matches.
They broke the Woods and the Patrick Reed in Forbulls and lost their confidence, and the U.S. New."Breazen Delbuy and 5-4, which is more eloquent than that.
On Saturday, Woods, who dragged out on two matches, were showing photos between Mika's and now he's 19 of the 29 competitions in Forbus and Forces, and the eight of them were defeated.
Justin Ross, who rested the morning for four days, returned with Heinrich Stencs and Dustin Jones and Brooks Crook, in three different locations in the world.
However, the pleasant and windy day on the southwest of Paris was not theirs.
Three times the major winners, Jordan Spain and Justin Thomas, set up a standard for the United States on Saturday.
In Forbulls, they set up the victory of 2 or 1 over Spain and Ian Potter, and then, in Forceems, Poland and Rory McKelroy, lost two first halls, and returned to the 43th.
Although Furich's side needed a balance to maintain it as a trophie, only once in the history of the Raydar Cup, he came back from four points less than four points.
It seems that the attack on Sunday will be beyond them, even if it stays two days in the second place.
Because of the lack of faith, the answer is that there is no way to separate ideologies.
The Ministry of North Korea reported on Saturday that in these cases there is no way that the government would abandon nuclear weapons alone.
Last year, North Korea's year of stopping nuclear experiments and military experiments, infrastructuring a nuclear site, and making an oath that the nuclear weapons and nuclear technology are not expanding, said the United Nations General Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
"But we don't see a similar reaction from the US," he said.
"We don't believe in our national security without any belief in the United States, and we have no choice to be alone in these situations."
Although a very familiar conference of the Washington attack against the conservation of nuclear conservation, as Pyongya did before, his statement emphasizes that he is not under the control of the single nuclear explosive; because he has the stairways of the movements of the movements of the North Korean, he has to gain the advantage of North Korean.
On June 12 of the afternoon at Singapore, Kim Jönnn and Donald Trump were inscribed on a joint statement and the Kim promised to ensure the protection of North Korea.
The U.S. state is that Pyongy Yang should first get out of nuclear weapons, even though he is trying to officially end the Korean War in 1950.
The Watch Tower also opposed the call for further expansion in the political upheaval that lasted over North Korea.
"The first time the U.S. nuclearization is determined, and the pressure to get their goal stronger has increased to the level of pressure, and even resists the promotion that the war is over.
"It's a papyrus dream of people who are ignorant about us that we're going to kneel down in the heat.
The problem is that our lack of faith increases because of constant influences."
No mention of the second U.S. radio program between Kim and Tramp, the U.S. president was talking about this at the United Nations conference.
Instead, in the last five months, the minister mentioned three conferences between Kim and the South Korean leader, Munn Jain, added: "The South Korean Party of the problem of devastation, in the case of the U.S. Constitution in the Korean subcontinent, it would not come to such an end."
However, Rie's voice was dramatically different from that of the U.N. last year. He called Kim "Rocket Man" and said that it was an attempt to kill him, so the North Korean Rocks that targeted the US Meinland.
The trumpet that threatened to destroy the North Korea completely last year in the United States this year brought Kim with praise to the courage to take up arms, but he also said that there must be more action to take until the North Korean nuclear acceleration.
Wednesday, the trumped that it had no time limit, he added, "If it took two years or three years or five months, it's no problem."
China and Russia claim that Pyongy Yang should pay the U.S. Security Council for the Actions.
However, on Thursday, the US State Secretary Michael Pompeio said to the UN Security Council: "Perhaps you will continue to carry out the underlying applications of the Security Council until the complete and final confirmation of nuclear defenses."
Since 2006, in the Security Councils, Pyon Young Yang has raised a battle against North Korea to prevent the financial assistance of the Baltic Mission Projects.
He saw Rie pumppio on the side of the UN General Assembly, and then he said he'd be visiting Pyong Yang the next month to prepare for the second afternoon.
Even though Pompio had visited North Korea three times this year, his final trip was unfulfilled.
He left Pyong Yang saying there's progress, but he's gone and in the corners he's been saying, "It's like the need that the Gandhi group rises."
If the United States accepts the "American Actions", then North Korea has guaranteed a military site and a nuclear summit.
Kim told him that the security guards promised in Singapore were asking him to be called "service acts" for the common ties of Washington.
Harvard students learn the school to get enough sleep
This year, a new course for all students at Harvard University, a new course opened up in the café, and the new course was presented to fight against the growing culture of macho.
One academy found that the basics about how to care for students in the world’s first university are often unpredictable.
Charles Seisler, a specialist at the Harvard Medical School professor and specialist at Brigham and Williams Hospital, believes that this course is the first class in the United States.
He was moved to start this course after a sermon about how sleep will affect the study.
When the talk was over, a girl came to me and said, "I'm in the last year, and now what's the matter with me?"
She said no one told me about the importance of sleep. It surprised me, and he told the telegraph.
This course, which was first revealed in this year, explains the basics to the students how good sleep is, how it contributes to Latin performances and improves their general well - being.
Paul Berry, a University professor at Harvard Medical School and professor at the University of Psychology at Harvard Medical School, said that the students had found that they had found serious sleep loss during the week.
A study of interracial TV tasks included an hour - long course of course.
There's a picture in a section of the dor Room, where students are clicking on coffee cups, cards, trains, and books, and they can hear about how sleep affects the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep is affected by sleep.
Another group explains how long sleep increases the risks of heart attacks, heart attacks, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the camp with an interracial TV Icon encourages students to think about their simultaneous methods.
We know it doesn't change students' behavior immediately.
But just as you have the right to know the healthy results of choosing cigarettes, we believe they have the right to know.
He said that a culture that is proud to say, "I've learned to sleep" still exists and that modern technology and the stress that increases the students ’ stress and sleep is the problem that is growing.
To make sure there's enough sleep for a student to resist pressure, fatigue, and anxiety, he said, we're throwing the brain into the motel when he doesn't sleep to avoid heavy weight, and it's constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old colporteur, who was studying Chemille and Psychiatric biology, helped to design Professor Sisla's course, and last year, he was on his first class in Harvard.
He said that this course opened his eyes and moved the whole camp to do this course.
He expects all graduates to be asked to complete a similar study project before joining the company based on the competition.
Professor Seisler recommended that students who keep up with sleep and awake should take care of their time and sleep and learn about the bad results of the Electronic screens and ElDE lights that come out; and that your circumstantial way will demoralize your circumstance, and then you will have problems for sleeping.
Lingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's Goal Zeroard players failed.
When Doi Meng was put on the base of Steven Georgd's team in Liingstein 1-0, Reingers felt that they were on their left side again.
From the 4-1 winner of St. Johnston in February, they were trying to record their first victory apart from Ibrox. But Gary Holtt's team was only 18 defeated in the middle of the game as the manager of the game.
The Menga Goll was hit seven minutes ago, but it didn't seem to be back in the racing line.
When Raymonds fell to the sixth point, Liingston climbed up to three, and the Golle was behind Hibernin.
It may be more difficult for Reingers to care for a licentious licentious licentious licentious licentious licentious leak.
Geard made eight changes in the team that went into Betred cup of coffee.
On the other hand, Holt, the same Livi, who built a point from Harts last week, would have made him very happy as that well trained group was breathing the enemies at every stage.
Although Raymonds had established the power of the pope, they were well - equipped to handle the boat that he had received.
In the second minute of the game, they had to score when Mennon's first lano's passport was sent to Pittmann's tower, but the middle-state player had to squeeze his chances.
Even though Kaygan Jacob's outstandingly famous free captain came to the Captain Craig Halfket, his assistant, Allan Lilguuu, had to hit a shot that took him to the post.
Raingers took control but there was more hope than faith in the game of their front line.
Alfredo Morlois must have found a penny when he and Steven Lois in fifteen minutes, but Refrey Steven Tomson rejected the Columbus' appeal.
In the first case, I saw two shots of Rachels, but a headline of Laszena Collibal, and Ovijari's lukewarm foot and Ibra Kelly's former Gordon Kelly didn't make a little trouble.
No one can deny that they deserve their match if they are against the football game on the 34th of Levy.
Regresses failed again to handle a unique setup of Jacobs.
The Scott Arfield did not respond when Deklan Galaguer gave up the Scott Robinson Bowen, and Robinson chose Mennon to complete his quietness without delay.
In time, Georged responded to Ryan Kent instead of Collibal, which caused a sudden accident.
But Liingston used to play exactly the kind of game they were playing with visitors, and Lithuania and Halket had long shots on both sides.
In the final stages, the Holt could draw their lead, but the chances of Mexico Jacques and Litguu were denied.
When Glenn Midelton, Raymond’s successor, argued for another late penalty, but Thomas again rejected it.
Twelve: Speecher of Guiger County
A page from our Sun-De Morning Peninsula: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, 136 years ago... the day for future physicist Johannes Wilhelm was born in "House" Georg.
It was an invention that developed a method of finding and measureing radioactive, eventually leading to the device called a gas counter.
From then on, this can be seen in the film by Roy Rogers and Dal Evans, who came out of the popes in 1950:
Man said: "What is this?
Rogers: "It's a guide counter that is used to find radioactive citizens, like Uranium.
When you turn these Internet phones on, you can hear the effects of the radioactive system in the forests.
Tell me, it's sure it's burning now!
In a few days after his 63th birthday, he stopped in 1945.
But this discovery remains to this day, bearing his name.
The new cancer vaccine will teach you to look at your fucking cells.
New Cancer Walks can teach the immune system to find and kill bastards
Vaccination teaches the immune system to identify bacteria as part of the treatment
It's the way a patient separates from the immune cells and changes in a label.
Then, they can see a common protein, which is responsible for many cancers, and then these cells will be put back into the patient again.
One of the patients with different types of cancers has been shown the prospect of a future transmission.
Over 18 months later, when a woman was treated using a vaccine to identify the immune system, her body cancer disappeared.
This type of process includes extracting from a patient’s immune cells and transforming them into a latrine that causes many cancers, known as HER2, and then relapsing these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Conservation Institute in Maryland said: "The results we received indicate that we have the most hope for the future."
Proof explained that HER2 influences the growth of many cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, lung cancer, and heavy cholesterol cancer.
A similar approach has been made in treating a blood transfusion, such as extracting cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells.
After the spectacle of the SNL, Kannai was released to the trump defence presses.
But this isn't enough.
After the uncompromising Perfumers, who praised the US President Donald Trupe and said he would rebel in 2020, the people hired Kann Wessel at Saturday nights.
After singing the third song called the Gost Town that night, the Americans wore their hat, he threw it against the democratics and reiterated his support for the trumpet.
"Whenever I speak to white people, they say, "How do you love the race?"
If I was concerned about ethnicity, he said, I would have changed from America a long time ago.
In connection with the sexual rights raised by Christine Blazi Ford, the S. L.A. started with a scandal that pretended to be the source of the truth that Brett Kawawa in front of the Saint Judicial Committee.
Even though Wessel didn't preach, Hausanian Chris Rock was uploaded at the Führer Social Media.
It's not obvious that Rock tried to ridicule West.
Also, he complained to the West audience that he had had a hard time wearing a hat.
"They frightened me in the barracks.
They said, "Don't go in the hat."
They threatened me!
"They say I'm a drowning place," reports Washington Examiner.
He said, "Do you want to see the place where I've been drowned? My superman's case is because you can't tell me what I want to do," he said, "Do you want to go ahead of the world?
Examine love."
At least two spectators heard his command, Verita reported that the SNCS members weren't there, and one said to the publication, "The Studio fell to the silence of death."
Wessel was sent to be the substitute of Gaica Aryan Grande, and Raper Mac Miller, whose former boyfriend, Aryan, was dead some time ago.
Like Peryre Bottle, the song 'West I Love It's shocked many.
Wessel was supported by Conditions Turner, the chief of TPSA's State group, and Convenience put it this way: "Thank you to stay away from the crowd."
But Karen Hard Tweett, who took his hospitality to Tok show, said, "He was just like that, it's amazing."
"But I don't decide to reward a person who believes that my society is degrading and degrading, to receive his music or his clothes or to support his "travel".
He's free.
"We're the same," they added.
Before the show, Raper Twitt told me that he had changed his name, "The man who was known as the official Kanny West".
He's not the first artist to change his name, he's following the path of the DDDD, known as Paf Dad, Paphi, and PDDD.
Wessel's fellow survivor Snup Doug called his name Snip Leone, music, changed his name to a punctuation, and was known as Principles.
In the burning of the Belfast restaurant, murders were committed.
On Friday at the restaurant in East Belfast, a forty-four-four-four-four-in-four-four-four-four-four-in-law assaulted him and conversed against him.

I hope the defendant will be brought to the trial on Monday.

The poem of John Snow in Tronz, the violent Fantasy Fantasy Ceremony of HBO, made Kitt Harington famous.

'I feel so strong now, personally.' He asked, 'Where did we make mistakes with men?' He asked.
What do we teach the growing boys about the problem we see today?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in the growth of the poisonous humanity, since there are many fads in the TV programs.
He continued: "What's self-determined, and what's taught?"
What qualities do young boys want to have inculcated in TV and on the streets?
I think it's one of the major questions in our time - how do we change this situation?
Because there's something wrong with young people.
He admitted in his interview that he would not do the game's principals of the Trones and the warrings and the horses.

China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of HIV - infected citizens increased by 14 percent.
Health authorities say that over 820,000 people in the country are infected with this disease.
About 40,000 new cases were reported on only in the second foot of 2018.
Most of the new cases include sexual relations, which marks a change from the past.
In some parts of China, it is customary to use blood as a result of the use of blood from infected persons.

HAV is a serious problem with sexual relations between the LGB communities in China.
In 1997, homosexuality became a crime in China, but the misconception of the LGB people continues in a harsh way.

Men often spread diseases because they do not accept enough sexual protection when sexual relations are involved.
The Chinese government has promised that since 2003, HIV drugs will be globally available as part of the effort to solve the problem.
Macinna Waters hasn't shed the data of their staff, and such accusations are false lies, and it's a rumor of the GPS.
On the Wikipedia pages of legalists, the history of the Republic of U.S. Senator was accused of being posted by a member of the U.S. president of the Maxine Wartre Saturday.
The Los Angels Democraud stressed that only the rights to uphold Panditits and Web sites on the right.
"Kings, lies, more degrading lies," said Waters in Tweed's statement.
Reports indicate that the U.S. Senator, Linz Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hawk’s addresses and phone numbers are involved.
During the trial of Senegal's case, on Thursday, an ignorant man from Capital Hill posted this information on the online.
Three seconds after questioning the canvas, in a short time the online information was sent.
Hild reported that the IP address that identifies the source of posters is associated with the Water SS office, reports such as Gateway Bandit and Retirement and released information from a member of the Water Stuff.
"It's absolutely a lie, it's a lie," Water's continued.
Because of these false and false accusations, one of my men has been overlooked in the identity of a member of the body, personal information, and security, but my life is not responsible for this information.
This unfounded accusation is absolutely false, it's a lie.
Online, this statement of Waters was summoned by criticism from others, including the former White House Publishing Secretary Ari Flesher.
"There's a rage in this denial," wrote Flesher.
"It indicates that they don't have the feeling of being a member of a congress.
If someone accuses you of something you don't do, don't be angry.
Don't be obligatory.
Do not question the motives of the accuser.
"I want to be calm and pure."
Fleisher was trying to compare the response of Waters to the criticism of the judge Cavanau, which the critics claimed that Kanwawa was very angry during the Thursday trial.
In Twitt, the president of the Reformer Omar Navaro, who was rebelling against the Water election, expressed his opinion in Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big thing," he put it on.
In his statement, Water stated that the office had announced the proper authorities and legal authorities of these false clubs.
"We will make sure that the criminals will be brought to light, and we will make sure that all my people, or any of my living, will be responsible for their work of destruction and danger," they continued.
A review of Johnny's English Street Again - The Powerless Spice Puff of Roven Atkinson.
In any new film of British tea, it's now a way to look for Brazil's importance, and it seems to be applied to this second part of the Action-Command-Speech Francis, which started in the film -- that French film, which started in 2003, was renewed by Junea, 2011.
Will this oppositionful self-supremacy of the matter of how clearly and permissive we are become the new evacuation of the country?
In any case, his name is signed with the name of a vast comic that was designed for the unspecified regions of the English - which is not spoken in English.
Of course, he's a fool, Cecade Agent, but he has a fancy beauty, and a dust of Mr. Ben's fascination with London's Declaration in the 2012 Olympic Order.
He actually lays the real basis for the man who once pretended to be Atkinson in Barklaard TV advertising that no one remembers.
The most new Johnny Release has one or two good poems.
I liked Johnny English, who comes to the Heliocopter, with the bleaching blocks of the Middle Ages and fortunately playing the helms for a while.
The ability to play physical jokes is evident in this film, but its results are not powerful, especially in a strange way, especially in the 'Greatful Brands,' simultaneously conservatives, such as the Mission Impossibly.
I feel more like the dance of the movies than the children, and I don't feel better or more like Johnny English than the silent movies he's playing, Mr. Ben. Ben.
Great Britain's serious problem is the eternal environment of this film.
A SIBERHOR BRITAIN'S SEBER HACER SHOULD BE SHOULD BE SHOULD BE SHOULD DEFERING THE IDER OF THE INTERNATION OF THE BRITAIN, THE INTERNATION OF THE INTERNATION OFFICE, THERE'S SECRIPTED THE ENGINE OF DEATHER ENTHERIPED ENTHERIED TO THE SEETHER ARE ENTHER ARE ARE AREATHER AREATH OF THERE ARE WAY.
It's the last blow of a sovereign minister who has been so politically depraved of democracy and hatred toward all, but it's true that Emma Tomson has shown a fine display of this character like this Terasa Meye, but there's nothing in script to do to them.
The secret counsel of the prime minister is to bring someone who has had to be separated because of his personal experience in the field of practitioners who are active in the field of psychiatry.
The man who wants to do this is Johnny English, who's a school master in some wealthy organization, but the class teaches how to perform 'Of-the-record' operations: there's some good time here, and it's better to teach Johnny about the school of Rocky Academy.
In the middle of the 19th century, however, the British Isles began to take advantage of the use of the British Isles as a result of the use of the British Isles in the United States.
The bag is now married, a submarine commander, a wife, this jolly-hoki-stick-stick in the character.
Bat Man and Robbie returned to the Secret Service of Herr Magistry, but they were confronted with the Virgin Beauty of Olga Kuryelenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister, who has the power to control Britain’s computer problems, falls into danger by the witch doctor: Jacquesy reveals the helicopter of Jacques Walt.
The English and the Buffalo’s facade begins: They wear vegetables and burn a French restaurant; in Wolta’s garb they stole themselves from abroad; and when they try to get to know the inside of the house of Walta, they are shocked by all the things that John has done.
They've certainly taken all the skills on this side of the film, but it's very gentle and enjoyable, and it's like watching the chit.
On an average.
I still couldn't think of what I felt when I saw other Johnny English films: the British film industry to give me a story on Roven Atkinson's office?

Shadow Chanceler used the Lebor conference last week to explain his view of a Soviet revolution in the Community.

This is a 36-year-old story.
I don't see anything new. "

Six fights-- as we usually do, it looks like we're giving more than we need to watch.
It's a sad situation. "
Dessert Island Diag:
Tom Dali says that he grew up to be lower than others because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to win.
The 20-four-four-four-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to the second school.
He spoke of the first radio 4 dessert Islands that Loran Lawon documented, and he spoke of the rights of nature that give “a hope. ”
He also said that he had little chance of getting the Olympics as a savior.
For a long time, Kristie Yuge, a long - term symptomist, had been on vacation for several months because of his chronic illness.
Dally sat on the first program of Laveh's program, and he said, "The community doesn't like boys and girls alike," so he felt better than others when he grew up.
He said: "The real things that I have given me to win are how I feel, how I feel, how I feel, and how I feel.
He said that he wanted to prove "something" and that he wasn't disappointed when everyone finally learned about his sexuality.
Dalli, who has had a Web Medal twice in the Olympics, has now become a large GBT publisher, and this year he used his presence at the Commonwealth Games held in Australia to request more legalization.
He said that he was saying that he was lucky to live in public without any adverse consequences and that he wanted to give others a "vision".
Dentin Lance Block, the U.S. filmmaker who met with a man in 2013, said three times that he was in love, "I was surprised."
Daniel married Oscar, who is 20 years older than he was, but he said that he had never had a problem with his age.
He said that when you entered the full - time ministry, when you were 14 years old, you first rebelled in the Olympics, and three years later his father died of cancer, and he said it was hard to meet a man who had suffered similar to that of his own age.
In June the couple became the parents of the son Robert Ray Black-daly, who said that he had changed his view.
"If you asked me last year, I would talk about getting a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there's much more than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic is gold medal robby."
After the discovery of the Massachusetts, in 2011, when I was four years old, my adoptive father named Dolly.
He finally asked if his father had never agreed to die because he wanted to see the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to stay in the front.
"But I couldn't tell you, until I was sitting in front of him," he said.
"I held him in his hand until he took his last breath, and finally, when he died, I finally admitted that he wasn't the victor.
The following year, Dalídie fought in the Olympics and gained a lucrative position.
"I knew that I had dreamed this all my life... and I had no better feeling to drown a country in an Olympic Games," he said.
It's also stimulating to choose his first song-heather's preservative, to the Olympics, and he'll still be angry when he hears this song.

The recorder's cup's Saturday hasn't landed memorized memorized with a good phonograph.
On Sunday, when Phil Miguelsson, the American, plays his 47th ride cup, he'll have to look for his phonograph so that it won't be an unhealthy hour.
In this two - year - old year of drinking, Mielson, who was playing the history - twelve times on Saturday, released the Captain Jim Furrich on the Forlls and Forces.
Instead of getting to the game all the time for the game, he had a five - time winner who encouraged others and had trained in the train, hoping that he could solve the problems he faced.
The 48-year-old Le Golf National Corse, who was absurd in the heat of his game.
This golf course doesn't make it so difficult, but it's going to meet nineths of the month Melchizeden meeting at the Finnish Chambersco Molynare, the British Operation Champion. He's now gathering all four of their round trips with the New Market Flightwood this week.
If the Americans below four point to play 12 simultaneous games with a strong start, the game of Mielson will certainly become a decisive one.
Furic expressed his confidence in his player, he didn't say anything else.
"He's fully aware of what he's going to do today, and he'll drag me around and tell me he's going to be ready tomorrow."
He's very confident.
He has contributed a lot to these teams in the past week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought.
He has to get into the games, like the others.
Nikki will cross the record of Faldo's on Sunday, Milesson's most rudimentary cups.
With the height of his personal record, it's about the end of a recording car.
Makelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven equals, but Furic said that his presence brought him to the team what he couldn't find in the garden.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's too big to be in the team," he explained.
I think it was a pleasure to meet him this week for young players.
He gives more than just a game.
The European Captain Thomas John knows that the big lead will soon disappear.
From the experience of the European captain Thomas John, Thomas John, you know that the bad lead that runs to Singapore on the last day of the Red Sea is going to end.
In 1997, in the Walderramy, Dean was defeated, where the team that was in the Captain of Sev Balsteros won five points more than the Americans, but it was quite different from the Finnishing Line, and the Leedinas, 141 to2 to 131.2 won.
"You are reminding yourself that there is a big lead in Waldenram, where we had a large lead in the Brooklyn line, where we lost, and we won the war in Valdès, but it was a victory." John said, John's team in the Gold International last week at John's team of 10-6 classes lasted a week, and in the Lee of Lee 10-6.
So history has shown me and others in the team that this hasn't ended.
You'll be boring tomorrow.
Get away from such a situation and do all the right things.
You don't stop until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, that's what we're trying to do in the trophy, and that's our whole attention.
I always say I focus on my 12 players in my team, but we know who's on the other side, they're the best players in the world.
Happy John added in his presentation of his team at the Southern Golf Court: "I can't go ahead of me.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
It's a different thing to do tomorrow.
It's a pleasure to be with a partner when things are better, but if you're alone in class, your capacity will be fully tested as a golf player.
That's the message you're going to deliver to the players, that's the best of you tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner, he must go and get the best out of him."
Not like John, it's the opposite attitude that Jim asked the players to show personality more than the opponents, the partners, and the same charge of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas.
Fury has seen both of this great magnetic field on the last day of the day, and Furick, the part of the team that succeeded in Brooklyn, was defeated by Europe’s “wonderful miracle in Madrid. ”
For the last day, Ben Cranco, captain of 1999, asked how he had dressed his players, "I remember every aspect of it."
"We have 12 important competitions tomorrow, but as you saw in the Brooklyn line, you want to get a fast start, as in Madrid.
In the United States, for example, the number of collisions between the ages of 16 and 18 has increased from 1 out of every 10 people in the United States to 1 out of every 10.
So we've set the line, we've prepared the player's style in the way we think we're right, you know, we're trying to get out of a magic tomorrow."
Tomas has been entrusted with the responsibility to take the lead, and at the top, he will meet Rory McCilroy, Paul Casey, Justin Ross, John Rahem, Tommy Fleitwood, and Ian P.
"I went along with this group in this Ordin, because I think it takes all the way," said John about his simultaneous sculptures.
The new German ship was relocated.
In 2014 the most new battleship in Germany was to be confiscated in exchange for the old and cold wartime battlefields, but local media reports that it won't be commuted for at least at least a year.
The New Bandan-Worthmber Clock's front ship, the "Reinland-Falls" Commission to the first half of the 2019, reported the deputy of the Army Day.
In 2014 the Novacan army had to get this ship, but the decision of the proud plan was in opposition to the Declaration.
In 2007, four Badaden-Worthmberg Class ships were ordered to use the old Bremen-Class ships instead.
These ships also have some secretive technology, such as the giant pyramids, the pilot-style missiles, the radio, the Infrared, and the Acoustic Sig Natures.
Another important factor is that long - term repairs are not to be done, so the country must be able to form new war ships from the ports and to the two years.
However, as long as they enter their service service, the warships with new technology are said to be delayed; they are said to allow Germany to express their power in foreign lands.
The F125 defeated battleships were held in the media last year, during which the German navy officially refused to commence ships and sent ships back to Hamburghelle Bloom and Vos Shippard.
After the delivery was returned to the ship builder, the first event in the history of the navy.
No one knows the reasons behind the ship's relocation, but the German media reports that there is a lot of probability of the "soft Weir, Hard Wear" and that the war effort is not worth it.
A group of just 120 sailors on the old Bremen Class Warships are the new Baden-Worthmberg Classs controls the warships and especially the social illiteracy of the software is important.
Moreover, information has been raised that the ship is too heavy for the ship to reduce the performance of heavy loads and the ability of the navy to renew the future will be limited.
In World War II, 7,000 tons of marine ships are believed to weigh more than the same type of seas used by the German car.
Even if the wrong hardware is replaced, the cost of the entire project becomes a problem, including the training of the entire project.
In the beginning, the cost was expected to be $2.2 billion, but it is said that it reached $3.6.6.
In the light of recent warnings that Germany’s nasal force is losing, the problems that affect the most new battlefields are particularly important.
In this year, Hans Peter Bartells, chief of the Defense of the German Parliament, admitted that in the navy the ships are actually missing.
The authorities said that the problems are being solved because old ships are decomposed and not receiving new ships.
He was saddened that nothing of the new Baden-Worthburg Clouds were of no use to the navy.
Observing the secret of the tails' life, National Trade
A new research is being done in an estate in the mountains of Scott Lund, aiming to see how the bats are used for food.
It is hoped that findings will benefit from the new knowledge of the behavior of these flying creatures and helping to guide the future protection activity.
In the Investigators of the Investigator Ross, a study conducted by scientists at the National Trade Fort Scott Lanter, has found common bats and soprano Pizzrelles, and the long - eard douben vans.
In the main locations around Estein, special records are set up for tracking the bats throughout the ceiling.
The NHS stuff and volunteer workers will be able to perform a mobile service using their detectives.
The sound of all recordings will help you to determine the nature of the vultures and to know which species of creatures are sounding.
Then, to create a detailed picture of the equatorial behavior of the batteries, a homemade map and report will be produced.
ROB DOWN, a naturalist, hopes that the results of the survey will reveal the most important regions of the ecosystem and how each species uses them.
These information will help to determine the benefits of the environment’s maintenance of grasslands and forests as well as the best caretakers.
In the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and Ukrainian has decreased dramatically.
The threats of deforestation from buildings and development activity that affect the conservation area are threatened by the threat of deforestation.
Infections of tarbins, electrical lights, flashpapers, and construction materials are threatened by bats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, since they are careful to hunt at night, their ears are more useful than eyeglasses.
They use complex eco-location technology to determine exactly the finches and obstacles of the flight path.
More than 270 historic buildings and 38 major parks throughout the country are seriously considered by the NTS evaluation of 76,000 Hectors of the Earth.
There are ten trained specialists in this organization, they regularly perform services, perform interdependence, and sometimes save lives.
The site has opened the first dedicated vantage point in the trivaye Estate of Dumbras, the world’s first dedicated vault in Scott Lund, and eight of the living creatures found in Scott London, which is called the Galloway.
Estate manager David Tomson says that this estate is the ideal place for batteries.
"There's a place here for bats," he said.
"There are old buildings, many big trees, and good housing.
But there are still many things that we do not know about the tails, so what we do here and in other estates will help the batterers to understand more fully what they need to do.
He emphasizes the importance of checking the bats before the construction of the buildings, for accidentally destroying a mother can kill 400 females and children, sometimes all the surrounding plains.
Here protects the tails, killing them, hurting them, or destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferel, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has requested help.
They said, "We're still learning more about our tails, we don't know how many species there are and how well the number of lifes is growing."
Ronalddo, an envoy who denounced the persecution story that had left the German magazine and told him to seek relief from the magazine.
Christina or Ronaldo, he said, by his name, is the story of persecution that came out against him, and he said, "The people are making their own name."
The German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, published the charges against the court.
In the Las Vegas Hotel, in 2009, a American girl named Catherine Maorga was tortured by Ronalddo, who played for Portugal and for youth.
Ronalddo accused her of giving her $35,000 without telling the story, which Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a few hours, the charge was reported and the three - year - old Ronalddo reports that his 142 million folders were spoken on the Instagram video were called "Victory News. ”
"No, no, no, no, no.
They said it's a false news, "Five times the Balon de orar crowned with hot oil.
"They want to be famous by my name.
It's normal.
They want me to be famous for my name, but it's part of work.
I'm happy, it's all right. "
Ronalddo's lawyers are preparing to pay the mandates against Der Spiegel, and according to Royatirs, the envoys described him as "a reporting that's not lawful about doubts in the field of business.
He added: "It's one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times."
It is said that this incident took place in June 2009 at a site in Pams Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas.
According to the documents presented in the Cleveland County Department of Nevada, after a night visit, Ronalddo and Maorga returned to Tartarus and reported that Ronaldo played with Maorga.
After the incident of accused Ronalddo's kneeling before him, says Maorga, he said "99% is a good man" but he betrayed himself.
Ronaldo confirms that both are involved in sexual relations, but the documents claim that it is safe.
Maorga claims that he went to a police hospital and took photos of what he had been beaten in a hospital, but then he agreed to a constitution outside of the court, for he felt that "respects would be frightened" because he was worried about being insulted.
Fifteen - year - old said that the incident was still deplorable and that the law was outlawed.
Ronalddo, who was about to leave the United States and join the Rhine Madrid during the charges, turned his head to the Italian Great Club of Jupiter at $100 in the summer.
Yuk will regret the loss of car builders forever.
After the breakout, if you lose the world's first position in the car construction, Yuke said, "I'll regret it forever."
He added to Toota's statement to BBC that if he left the United States without a deal, the production of the factory in Bernásstan, in Derby, would be temporary.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car builder said that if it's going to happen without a solution, it's going to be lost by the accident of a period in the countryside.
Last year, the Bernest Plant, built by Toyoto’s Orients, built 150,000 cars, 90 percent of which were loaded into the rest of the European Union.
"I think, if you finally leave the United States of Europe, you'll stop building in our factory," Marvin Cook of the management director of the Bernest of Toronto.
Other young car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguardland Rover, have been concerned about how to get out of the European Union without a treaty.
BMW says, for example, that the Mini Plant of Oxford will be closed for a month after Breck City.
In the case of a breakdown without a thought, the main concerns of car manufacturers are the risks of sublime Chein.
On the basis of "the time of the clocks," Toyata's construction line runs from the European Union every 37 minutes.
On March 29, if you leave the European Union without an idea, you could be interrupted on the border, and this is because the system says that the termination and famine of the elements are caused.
The company said that it's impossible to collect more materials for a day than for Toota's debiter Plant, so it's necessary to stop building.
Clark said that Teresa Maye's program for the future relationship with the European Union was designed to avoid such tests of the end.
"We need a thought, not only to enjoy current success but also to have the best idea of allowing us to use this opportunity," he said to the Tudy program on the BBC radio 4.
"We had a very high-specific distribution network, and we certainly have to continue, and it reminds us of evidence not only from Toota but also from other builders."
Although Toota did not say how long she would be able to build, the company warned that much of the Planet’s competition would diminish and that work would be lost.
Peter Sullarys, who has been working in Bern for 24 years, said that Peter Sullirez, the unit of the United States in Plant, was concerned about the loss that his members had increased.
One government lawyer said: "We have set a precise and reliable plan with regard to our future relationship with the European Union."

Even though he had news to leave his place, he went to the White House last Monday.
On the other hand, the United Nations in New York reported on a weekly meeting with the Trumpet.
The Trumpet said that the meeting was delayed, but it was to avoid it during the trial of the Senate Judicial Committee, and Dr. Christine Blessing Ford, one of the women who accused him of being sexually abused during the trial.
On Friday, the FBI search for a week's lengthy search against the canvas was relayed by the entire Senate Volting.
Tram's Private Secretary Sara Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When I asked about a meeting with Rossenste, she said, "No date has been decided for it, it's possible to be in this week, and I think you'll take the rest of the Supreme Court for a week.
Let's see, I'm always interested in making new information to the media.
Some reporters will question that statement after Sands Spater 10th, the White House hasn't been confiscated.
The host, Chris Wallace, sought the cause.
Sanders said that the low - TV reporters ’ anger was not the cause, but they said: "I don't disprove the fact that they are coming together."
They also suggested that the media, the tracts, and other direct contacts be made.
"The president is dealing with more questions and sessions than his predecessors," they added without evidence and said, "We've seen their numbers."
There will be press conferences, saying, "If the media have opportunities to ask the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do that so many times for the past few weeks. We've seen you do it. You're going to talk to the president of the United States instead of doing the press.
When the White House is freed or at the offices of the Watch Tower Society, it is time to give a regular answer to questions during the press conferences with or special ones.
It's very rare to deal with the newspapers themselves.
This week, we could show why it was in New York, and the reporters appeared strangely free but free.

The letter, Miss Freeman, wrote: "In addition to the summer, the excommunications between UK and EU have continued, and the decisions may be made during this winter.
But the British began making preparations for a situation that could not be dealt with.
I know that this is a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution they have made to each member of the Stuff.
The precious experience and skills shown by fellow workers in various parts of the European Union and elsewhere have contributed greatly to strengthening and improving health care in the field of health care and well - being.

When foreigners come to Britain and buy things, they'll have to pay a high standard.
And when you buy things in UK, the foreigns have to pay a high standard, and the extra money they get is used to help the homeless by the Torlie Plants.
This move will disable the corb's move to attract young voters.
You can't pay off the tax in Yuke.
The tract hopes that it can collect up to 120 million pounds each year to help non-employed people.
Today, Teresa declares that when foreigners buy goods in UK, they have to pay a high - level amount of money to help those who are not homeless.
This move is an attempt to prevent Jeremy Gorb from attracting young farmers by giving them more expensive homes and aiming out high - income lucratives.
Put a standard set above the people and institutions who don't pay taxes on UK, and the extra amount of money that is available will be backed up by the government’s move to give home to those who don't have a home.

Many rich areas of the country have become the capital - the best percentage of foreigners who have been bought and spent more time outside the country.
This new task will come only a few weeks after Boris Johnson invited him to cut off the standard for helping more young people take their first home.
He charged that the price of property is high because the great structures of the earth were not used, and he urged Mrs. Mae to leave the quadruplets on the roofs that he could afford to solve the British's "serious shame".
Mr. Corbin declared a fascinating series of banished homes.
He also wants to give the council greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "I said last year to reestablish the British dream, to make life better for every new generation.
That means we're going to fix our damaged housework.
The British will always open to people who want to live here, work, and build up their lives.
However, it would not be fair to buy homes that are hard - earned as well as those who do not live in Britain and to foreign companies.
The dream of a lot of people having their own home is too far, and the shame of being able to sleep well continues to be a reality.
My final wish is to control Scotland.
At one point, Scotland is controlling his desire for the last desire, says the sunland boss Jack Ross.
The challenge of reproducing the North East Club is that there's 42-year-third Scott, on the third floor of the Leg floor.
He moved to the stadium of the light in this summer after he was led to St. Miran Prize.
"I would like to play for my country as a player.
I got a B captain, and that's all, " Ross BBC Scottish told the Sportson of Sportson.

"Can I bring this club back to Premier Leg now?"
The structure and facilities of this club are undoubtedly included in the Premiere League.
"It's not easy to bring it there, but if I can bring this club back there, I can see that I've succeeded here."
For 15 months, Ross spent only three years his manager's life at the assistant Bosa of Dumarton and Harts Coaching Stuff.
Then he helped Alovakia to get to Thompson to the third row, and he saved him from St.
Ross also says that his client, Hart Lipul, Falk, St. Miran, Hamilton Academyal, is now happier than the sports carrier.
"It may be the right way," he says, taking the responsibility of Leoa.
"I really believed that the management would agree more to me than to play.
It's strange, but it's got enough to live without shame to get to some heights.
But playing can be difficult.
We'll have to pass through a lot of things every week.
I still have problems and challenges for my job, but I feel very good at the manager's mess.
I always wanted to come to the manager, and now I'm here, and I'm glad I'm doing what I like at my best.

When he spoke about the family and the high school period, he sometimes felt very nervous, uplifted, and burdened.
The Cleveland Democrats of the Committee accused him of having set up an angry Liberia for the failure of the president's election in 2016.
The testimony of the canonog proves that he is unworthy of service at the Supreme Court, for they said that he displays a distasteful attitude toward the democratic.
"I think he's disqualified by such statements and the way he spoke of Clinton and Democratics."
Pélosus was disappointed when he asked if he had established the canvas location and had received most of the Democratic Republic of Congo and would have imported him.

I'm angry."
Later, they followed the same pattern.
And I thought it was a wise decision."
It is lawful to shed tears of anger, but they are basically misunderstood.
There's one thing I could remember from the previous job, I was crying because I couldn't express myself in an office with men's more than one day... and a woman who was older than I was always afraid of, pulling me in the scandal where I was lying on my neck, dragging me down the steps.
"They don't want to see you cry," they told me.
"They don't know you're so angry.
They think you're so sad that they're only happy that they can get you through.

The most important event of this week was the new price of $,200 million, and half of all the items from China and the US have been taxed.
Every time the beijing was returned to the same coin, between 5 and 10 percent of the next 60 million American commerce paid taxes.

Al Moulaum said that the Syriac regime would accept all the aids to rebuild a broken country
