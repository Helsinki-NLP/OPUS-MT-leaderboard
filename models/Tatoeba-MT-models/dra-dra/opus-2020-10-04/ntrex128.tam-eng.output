Welsh AMs were worried about being like fools.
There is a confusion among some AM that the MWPs ( members of the Welsh Parliament) should change their theme.
This is because of the plans to convert the name of the law into the Velsh navy.
They were worried that AMs in all political fields could call it a mockery.
One lab AM said his group was worried that it was "with Twp and Pwp".
For readers not from Wells: Wwp means that it is stupid and pwp is a flower.
A team of groups reported that the group was "not happy" and recommended alternative methods.
A Welsh Conservatory told us that his group was "conservative" about the change of name, but it said that it had a small calculation for MWP from MP.
In this situation, the Welsh letter W.
The law, which is now making known the names of changes, stated: “It will certainly be a matter of whether members of the law are called at the end of any of the explanations.
The law of the Welsh government gave the government authority to change its name to the Welsh law.
In June the oath issued the conclusions of the public counsel on recommendations, which was most supported by the Welsh Parliament.
As to the title of the AM, the order supported members of the Welsh National Park, or WP, but the option of MWP was highly supported in public counsel.
The AM recommends openly changing options, but the struggle to attain a united viewpoint may be a headache to Ellen Jones.
The law on reforms includes other changes regarding the way the AM operates, including the rules for deposing AM and the system of organizational procedures.
As the law argues, AM will receive a final statement about how to be called.

As an enemy of the public declaration on the name, George Ivanov, former president of the Macedonian president, said that I would ignore the word.

Some members of the church confessed that they were unconscious in part of the sacred secret.

John Edward: People around the world need language
Scottish - free schools are showing a series of fine education. The game, the art, music, and other social activities that came with personal and collective effort are also available in 2018 with the finest educational results.
These schools representing the students and their parents, along with the 30,000 students of Scotland, are the greatest service ever given to the students and their parents.
In addition to providing the best education available to their students, independent schools provide a way to create their industry and to transform them into global citizens.
As a schoolteacher develops the design and functions of a school, new languages become popular and a popular choice.
Nelson Mandela: When man speaks to him in a understandable language, it touches his mind.
When he speaks in his own language, it touches his heart.
One powerful reminder is that only English could not be trusted to establish and obtain contacts from other countries.
From the conclusions of this year, we can see that there are scores of lingua francases within independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have received high - grade A.
According to data from 74 members of SCIS, 72 percent of students in the managers have a high - grade grade A, 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent of the students studying Spanish.
This is evident that Scotland’s independent schools teach the foreign - language languages that children and young people need.
In schools with free schooling, the language can be seen as an important choice (intellection, technology, engineering, and mathematical), like StEM lessons.
In a survey conducted by the UK Commission based on employment and skill in the year 2014, those who fill empty spaces say that they say 17 percent of the language deficiency.
In the United States, for example, the number of people who speak the language of the country in the United States has increased dramatically in the number of languages spoken by the United States.
For the best employment opportunities for languages, language is essential in the world as globalization.
Whatever the trade, learning the second language will be a skill that will help you throughout your life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad will automatically lead to a succession of a person who has many languages.
According to your Gov, who conducted a survey of 4000 UK youths in 2013, 75 percent of the people could not speak foreign languages. 15 percent of the young people were able to speak French only.
This is why the investment of the languagewriter is important to children today.
In addition to many languages, in developing economic conditions, this method will prepare the children for meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school is different in the languages they teach.
The desire to teach many schools to learn new languages shows that other schools, like the manager, are important to UK in 2020.
Whatever your child’s wishes, there will be a lot of languages and educational teachers to learn in independent schools.
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) states: “In the United States alone, 1 out of every 4 children in the United States has been killed, and 1 out of every 4 children in the United States has been murdered. ”
It cannot be denied that language is important for the growth of the country and the worldwide commercial environment, so it should be reflected in education.
In addition, modern languages must be considered as the “American Introduction. ”
This opportunity is open to young Scottish youths, who are more concerned and more capable of providing this opportunity.

Driver file 2018: In a single fight that is to take place on Sunday, the American team tries to protect their trust
It seems that after a three - dimensional contest, the competition between the four teams to take place on Saturday afternoon may provide the right prospect for the recording file.
The Swindling Woman is a fast game, a game that focuses only on a single player, and there is no one who plays like that.
So, now, where do they view the prospects?
"They were six points ahead, but now it's four points, so we have some chances."
The euro team is in front of four points, so they have more chances.
As Spain said, the Americans have a little chances, and in the four games played, both Spain and Justin Thomas took three points, so they have ample responsibility to encourage them.
Speeth, who had been a former athlete, left the game of deto To Green.
In his neighborhood there was too much entertainment, and he and Thomas played with the goal of getting plumbing on four corners, reaching the rate of two people.
Even the winner’s game of 15th was overly popular, and the winner realized that the Americans were worthy of it.
He said, "You were really concerned and concerned about your game."
All these players have left now.
18 points are targets for success.
In the past two days, only two Francesco Molienary and Tommy Fleidwood have more points than Speeth and Thomas in the experience of the railroad file.
In the United States, for example, the number of people who have been raised in the United States has increased from 1 out of every 4 families to 1 out of every 4 children.
The couple who didn't get a Saturday afternoon were only "Molywood", but they missed the fraud on Saturday morning and Friday, and then on Friday morning they received nine points again.
Their intelligence and ability were pervasive, and they were successful on Sunday, and there could not be any prominent warriors who would support Europe’s success at the end of the Fleud or Molienary Games.
The two gained points at the same time in different stages.
Even though it may be advisable to praise Europe’s success, it must be spoke of.
In the morning, four balls were joined by Bupa Watson and Web chimpson Alex Norman, playing in Sergeyo Corsa.
BOY AND FRIEND NIN NEW DQ SPANISH and Americans are the means to get closer to success.
No one is helping you to get points on Sunday.
It was a pleasure to see the Formula and the Forum watching between the couple’s understanding, the way of counsel, and the way they immediately adjusted their tastes.
So far, the European team has been playing very well, particularly on the last day, but the Forest has been a favor to them without doubt because of the great American game of the surrounding United States.
The urope team is the top 10-6 point on the last day of the rectangle file.
By attaining 10 - 6 points in the series against the United States in the Saturday Games for the United States, the Europe team gains a healthy start on the last day of the rail file.
Tonight, Tommy Fleidwood and Francesco Molinier, a two - winged Tiger Insurance, has four points in the Lee Golf National competition.
Two years ago, Thomas Jorne’s European team to keep the file that they lost in Hollytown, controlling the four balls of the morning on the American team that had been wrongly played in the contest, took the course in 3 - 1.
The U.S. teams succeeded in two competitions, but they were unable to balance points.
To keep the file, Jim and Furkish teams need eight points in 12 single - matches that are held on Sunday.
Floydwood is the first European player to win four points, and he and Moliana were called "Molywood" after a special weekend game, and these are the only two pairs who continued to win four of the deals from the start in history.
After four balls defeated Woots and Patrick Reed, they fell at 54 points with more certainty and with more determination.
Woots, who gradually developed up to two synchronized contests on Saturday, manifested sensitivity from time to time, but now he has failed in seven competitions for four pairs and four persons, so far he has failed in 19 of his 29 contests.
Justin Ross relaxed in the morning, and later incorporated with Henry Stenson, Dustin Johnson and Brux Kobeka, the world’s first and third locations.
It was not made up of Europe on a beautiful and southwest day in southern Paris.
The three greatest winners, Jordan Spider and Justin Thomas, set the goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They succeeded in playing the four balls in Spanish John Rahme and Ian Paulder in the contest, and Paul and Roy McNeilroy fell at the time when they lost two points.
Only in history has one team moved from four points to a single section, but it is enough for Fury teams to balance the competition to keep the file.
However, after two days at the second place, the opposite attack on Sunday appears to have been an unexpected color.
North Korea says 'no way' can make hopeless a emptiness.
In the United States, where the U.S. Insurance Department of North Korea was held on Saturday, the United Nations continued to set up financial bans and said that under such circumstances there was no way to reduce his confidence in the rest of the United States, and there was no way to leave the country as a whole.
Last year, Rie Jong Hoo of the World Society stated that the yearly public meeting of the United States was under way by the stopping of nuclear experiments, the removal of nuclear experiments, the guarantee that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology will not increase.
He said, "We have received no answer from the United States."
"American can't trust in their national security without any hope, and there's no way we can use weapons in this kind of situation except for the first part of our use of weapons."
( It is noteworthy that the Vatican has taken practical steps to prevent nuclear weapons (and is significant) but his report is important, as he has done in the past, and he has not rejected any nuclear bans.
On June 12, Kim confirmed that at the first U.S. president and president of the United States in Singapore, Kim Jung Jönnne and Donald Dyr’s reporting a summit that guarantees the protection of North Korea, as Dr.
To the Korean War in 1950 - 53 C.E., North Korea requires a systematic solution, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also faced invitations to relieve the severe international bans on North Korea.
"America," he said, "to force the policy "to quit nuclear weapons at first" to increase the rate of opposition by economic obstacles and "respecting the end of the bulk."
"The day's dream of people who don't know about us is that we can be fooled by material things.
But the problem is that constant economic obstacles increase our lack of confidence.
At the beginning of this week, the U.S. president of the United States mentioned no program for the U.S.
Instead, the judge reported on three visits between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jen, who said: “If the problem of giving up these nuclear weapons is not the United States but South Korea, there is no opposition to leaving the nuclear weapons of Korea.
After Mr. Eileen, president of Demise, called "Raket Man," of the Kammy Suicide Army, Rie said that the Rockets of North Korea have been targeted by the American Law Council in Mennonite America, and his voice was completely different from the last year.
During the last year, the Miritian Drum called North Korea "I'm going to destroy it." Kim commended him for his courage to take up arms in the United States this year, but he said that more work would be done, like financial bans, until North Korea completely abandoned nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, it's no longer time for it and says, "It may be two years, three years or five months, and there's nothing trouble in it."
China and Russia report that the United Nations Security Council should give awards for the activity of Bionga.
However, on Thursday, the state secretary of the United States of Mike Pompio reported on the United Nations Security Council: “The conservation of the Protection Council must continue until the release of nuclear weapons has been fully tested. ”
The Security Council has launched financial bans on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to prevent the technological and polytheistic campaigns.
He said that during the United Nations General Assembly, Bombio met Rio, who said that the next month he would go back to Bangkok to prepare for the second Ukrainian convention.
This year Pamphylia has already gone to North Korea three times, but his final trip was not in progress.
In July he left Pyongyang, saying, "They're making requests" for a few hours in North Korea.
If the United States overturns, North Korea's three-year meeting in this month has confirmed the removal of the molecular system and nuclear complex.
Kim told him that he would become "contributions" to make the connections to the security guarantees of the troub in Singapore and the conservation of the Washington.
Harvard students take a lesson in getting sufficient rest
Harvard's students take a lesson in getting enough rest this year from a new song introduced in Harvard University, where the class gets a lot of sleep, and it's against the growing culture that is getting drunk with coffee all night.
One educator found that students at the world’s world’s first - grade university do not know much about the basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Seysler, a specialist of Harvard Medical School and specialist at the hospital, developed this lesson in this way, and he believes that it was first designed in the United States.
After giving a talk on the effect that sleep would have on learning, he was encouraged to start this lesson.
At the end of the conversation, a girl came to me and asked me, "Why is this told me in this year of my education?"
He said no one told him about the importance of sleep -- and this surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
This textbook, which has been started for the first time this year, explains how good sleeping habits contribute to education and tracks, and explains to the students how their general good life improves.
Paul Parra, professor of mental - health at Harvard Medical School and director of the University of Health Services, concluded that the university concluded that students are losing their sleep in the weeks.
This text that is taken for an hour includes several continuous nucleus operations.
In one section there is a picture of a shelter room, where the tracks are affected when they lose sleep about the effects of caffeine and light, and the importance of keeping a bedtime routine by clicking coffee cups, movies, and books.
In another section, the participants tell how it will increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer if it is not long asleep.
The charter of a complex with symbols affected one another encourages the participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know-- you have the right to know the health consequences of choosing cigarette smoking, and Professor Sesler said.
He said that there's still a lot of pride in pulling the al-nights, and modern technology and increasing pressure on students is a growing problem.
To make sure that you have enough sleep, you have a good quality, should be a student’s ‘ physical weapon ’ to fight stress, discouragement, and depression, he said to avoid weighting, so to avoid starvation, they continue to create them.
Professor Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Catholic, who studied chemistry and biochemistry, helped to designate the song, and Harvard took one of his first classes in the year Harvard.
He said that the school opened his eyes and stimulated the volume of song.
He believes that all the backbone students will be asked to complete a similar study program before joining the competition.
Professor Sesler recommended that students check the program for when to go to bed, when to get up, and that they should be alert to the dangers of electronic scripts and Electronic lights.
Liingston 1 - 0 Ranges: Mega - hit collaborated Germany’s teams

The deepest Kecon's Jacobs Free-Kigel Sculptor has been discovered, but only one of his opponents, Alan Litgow, could insert a wide space on the post.
They insisted on Rangers, but at the end of the third stage, they found that their hope was greater than their hope of the game.
Alfredo Morlos was sure that he had a chance on the foot line because he and Steven Larses were attacked by the Colombians, but Brother Stephen Thompson prohibited the controversies of the Colombians.
Ranges coped with only two-six shots in the target, but the former Iraq College, Leyam Kelly, was clearly challenged by Lessena’s penicillin, and a ruthless Oui Aija's streak.

But Thompson turned his back on the face, for he had had a problem with Jacob’s.

Maxus Waters wrote: "The GOP functioner has issued the data of the GOP Senator" and refused to be called "a valid lie" and said that it's only a whole plan."
On Saturday, U.S. president Magazine Waters Saturday, one of his employees reported a severe trial for the charges that the U.S. Guatemala Gutsi Senates reported on three personal information on Lamakers, Viktors.
Los Angeles social energies insisted that the "Altra Wing" teachers and teachers act quickly on the Web.
"Fake, lie" was declared in his Twitter report.
The information published by the U.S. Department of Party has been found that Lindsie Graham, South Carolina, and Utah’s Mike Lee and Arren Hudch, had two home addresses and phone numbers.
It is noteworthy that this information was released on the Twelve Thursday evening during the federal court’s trial of Bridegroom, who was accused of sexual misconduct.

This unfounded charge was totally wrong, and the watchers continued to claim that this was a complete lie.
In view of this false charge, my employees who have lost their identity, personal information, and security said that they are in no way responsible for the issue of issue.

They should not ask the accusers.
They need to be calm and mild. ”

In any new film in the British style, it's customary to expect the features of the press, which seems to apply to the Japanese Anglican Infrastructure Library, which started in the year 2003, and started again in the Johnny English Republic in 2011.
Would it be funny to recount the story that centered on how obvious we are to be fools for the country’s new export?
In any case, he has the opportunity to renew them a second time with large - eyed eyed Johnny English — his gestures are in front of all other English - speaking comic movies.
He has been held as an insurmountable secret agency, and he has been acting in a little way to show Clossa in a little way, and the fire spread through the Olympics in the early 2012 ’ s by Mr. Ben and Dolmen.
He had been in a soccer - based gambler who now disappeared from his wake - up book television advertisements and played the piano based on the International Mystery.
The recent JEA outing has one or two precious features.
I liked his challenge when helicopter’s movements on Johnny England, with little protection, hit his head.
The gift of the adcence for the festive smile is kept to a display, but laughter is felt to be very powerful and to be extreme, especially as the "Syrius" movies and the Mission Episcopal are now the main characters of humor.

We need to use our time and energy to do God’s will and to do his will.
Be willing to do all you can, and do the right thing.
This will not be possible until you receive the required scores on the board.
We have a goal, a goal that is to try to win this file, and it will be our only concern.

I'm glad I'm glad that his soldiers played in the Great Colfusion: “I'm not going to do what I can.
Tomorrow’s competition will be a different host.
The ability of each person during the day’s competition is to bring forth light, which is a different matter that we must do.
It is a wonderful feeling to play with Bartner when everything is right, but when you play alone, you will examine your full potential as a colphin.
You need to make this message clear to the soldiers, express your full potential tomorrow. The Bible says: “The world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever. ”
Now leave your partner, let him play alone, and let him express his full potential.
In contrast with Biyon, the opponent, Jim Fryrick, expects to play better when he plays privately than when his players are playing as Barters.
Furic was on both sides of the two unexpected changes, and Europe won because of what happened in Madina, and before the Frustration was defeated, he was in Brooklyn.
The last day, Ben Grenshaw, a Captain who held his troops together in 1999, answered the question of how he acted, "I remember every word."
"We have 12 important sports tomorrow, as you saw in Brooklyn, and I want to give you a wonderful start in Mexico.
When the relationship is placed in the same direction, it is more stressful in the races in the middle.
We've set up our orders, we're going to land the right players we feel, we're going to have some magic matches tomorrow'.
Thomas handles the task of trying to win, and he meets Paul, Justin Ross, John Rahme, Tommy Fleidwood, with Roald McKlroe, along with another dot, Ian Paulder and other Europeans.
"I'm stuck with those in this line, and I think it's gonna lead to success all the way," said Bionan of his single choice.
Resurrected by Germany’s New Strategy
Instead of the old snowstorm warships, the local media reported that the new Bangladesh had to be replaced in Germany for 2014, but it could not be for the next year because of bad organizations and the increase of prices.
The military newsmagazine D.J.A. reported that the delivery of the first ship of the New Bandand-Berke-Rabel was postponed until the first half of the 2019.
The ship must have been on the beach in the year 2014, but it had to be lost on the important project.
In 2007 four Bantne-Berke-Ramon ships on the seashore will be replaced by the old Bremann-Rapad Boards.
They also understand that they contain powerful rhythms, air - resistant, and shorter radiators, as well as stelt technological designs.
In addition to long - term care in other important areas, it would be possible to be one of them if new ports were to be pushed from local ports for two years.
However, because of the continued delay, better fights will be due to a period of time when they have already entered foreign service, which is a lesson for Germany to value the ability of foreign nations.
The last year’s headline was F125, when the German sailing officer refused to use the port and returned it to Lom and Vas Schiperdor, Hamburg.
This was the first time a ship was returned to its construction company after the television.
The reason for this revival was very small, yet the media announced that the battle had a number of important “valuable and software deficiencies ” and that the battle would be useless if it was used in military action.
Bannburg-Ruyer ships are run by a group of 120 sailors, so software shortages were very important. The number of these vessels is only half of the old Pyrene-Premens.
Moreover, it was found that the ship was overweight to reduce its activity and that the ship could not have been able to enter the future of the ship’s developments.
It's believed that 7,000 tons weighed twice as much as the weight of Germans in World War II.
In addition to a lack of fuel, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the ship’s crew, also becomes a problem.
This is said to have risen from 2.2 billion ($3.6b) to $3.1 billion (U.S.).
In view of recent warnings that Germany’s ocean power is on the decline, the problems in the new battlefields have become more important.
At the beginning of this year, Hans - Peter Bardells, president of the German Democratic Republic of Germany, admitted that the number of ships used in the sea was few.
The problem is getting worse, since the authorities have said that old ships are changing to the point of being unused, and new ships are not being provided.
He's sadly told me that no Band-Attom-Berke-Raken ships are unqualified to join the ship.
National Driver, who watches the secret life of white lights
A new research is being under way in a Scottish highlands in view of how white lights use to search for its food.
This has also indicated that the results of research will provide new information on the function of individual pyramids and will help them to cope with future security measures.
Scientists at the National Drugs for Scotland research the common and soberrano biistrels and red - brown white lights that live in the Wester Roosevelt and the Independent cardinals.
Special recorders will be applied to the main locations of the whole country in which they live to monitor the activity of the zebras throughout the Cheese.
The NHS employee and employers will use the computers that are available on the mobile phone.
The expert on all records will find that the sound is irrational, and what biochemical does.
The map and report will be prepared to create a picture that illustrates how their activity on the globe is functioning.
NTS, a natural - security consultant for NTS, stated that the conclusions would reveal which parts of life are important to lighthouses and how they are used through each animal.
This information will help to determine how to care for nutrients for the benefits of living, such as luxuries, lighthouses, and other related organisms.
The number of white lights throughout Scotland and Yuke has decreased by an estimated amount in the last hundred years.
They are threatened by a building that affects the area where birds live and by a medicinal job and a loss of living quarters.
In addition to the threat of air - conditioning and lymphocytes, pesticides kill insects and some chemical substances in building materials and the attacks of cats that are raised as pets.
The white lights are not really blind.
However, since they seek food at night, they use their ears more than their eyes when catching the flipper.
They use a high - sounding radio device to identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, over 270 historical buildings, 38 important parks, and the country’s 76,000 hats are responsible for the protection of 76,000 hectares.
There are ten trained specialists who work in the Service Department and sometimes in the relief work.
The company has built the security of Scotland’s first and fallout at The Revolution Estein in Tamperes and California, which is home to eight of the 10 white species of Scottish species.
According to David Thompson, the estate manager of the estuary is the best place for valves.
He said, "We have a better place for the vans here in the Trevies."
"We have old buildings, more old trees and a good place of living.
Yet, there are still many things that we still do not know about, and the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand more about the needs of the lighthouses.
He insists that before taking care of the building projects, checking the Volcanoes is important, since destroying one grassland floor may cause 400 female whites and young whites to die, destroying almost all species.
It is illegal to kill and kill, torture, torture, or destroy their living quarters.
The Scottish officer for the Vauval Security Trist, Elizabeth Ferber, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still need to know more about lights and many of our natural creatures, and we don't know how their numbers are diminishing."
Ronando rejects rape branches and his lawyers touch the German journal
Christo Ronando has said that "false news" against him, and he used his name, "Brother wants to make himself famous," his lawyers have appealed on the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
Christo Ronando has called "false message" against him and said, "Brother wants to make himself famous" by his name.
In the year 2009, the Portuguese and the Juvenile Forest was accused of the rape of a American woman named Catherine Maorga, in the Los Vegas Hotel room.
On Friday, Dar Speck reported that he agreed to pay him $375,000 so that he could avoid any trouble with this incident.
A few hours after the news about the branches appeared, 33 - year - old Ronando spoke to his 142 million pharmaceuticals on the video, and he announced that he was “false messages. ”
"No, no, no, no.
Today, the message they delivered is a false message. ’
They want to be known by my name.
This is a common practice.
They want to be known by my name, but this is their work.
I'm happy and everything's going well.'
In regard to these charges, Ronando's lawyers are preparing to appeal to the case on Dar Speck, saying, "It's impossible to deliver a message of doubt about certain matters." Reuters news.
This may be one of the most serious violations of individual rights that have been violated in recent years, said Judge Christine Sir, for the moral costs associated with severe violation.
The crime has been said to have occurred in the Chamber in Palms Hotel and Cassinna, Los Vegas, in June 2009.
According to the documents in the Clarke County Tristruary in Nevada, it was reported that Ronando and Maorca both went to Ronana’s room, where they raped him.
Maorka reported that after this incident, Ronando fell on his feet and apologized, saying "99 percent of" was "good man," and knowing that he had made a mistake.
In the documents, Ronando said that both of them had sexual relations, but it was committed to both of them.
Maorka said that he went to the police and took his wounds in the hospital, and later he accepted the studio outside the court, because he was worried about "the threat" and was worried about being "smoking in the public."
According to 34 - year - old Maorga, she is looking for a way to avoid the heat because of the crime.
Ronando was at the Reformed Major of Manchester when he was accused of rape, and during this summer he joined the Italian jurisdiction of 100 million.
UK, exiting from the European Union function: if you lose car manufacturers, it'll always be sad.
After Yuke left the European Union, trader Greg Clark said that if he lost his position in his car production, he would have to "never regret."
In his text, Doota Yuke told the Bibisins that if Britain left the United States without a treaty, they would be required to stop production temporarily at their factory in Bernaustan, near Turkey.
"We need a dollar," said Mr. Clark.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, if Britain’s breakup from one European Union is delayed, the result can result in an unemployed job crisis.
Bernosta, the producer of the Oriss and Anesis, has produced about 150,000 cars last year, and 90% of these have been exported to other parts of the European Union.
Marvie Cook, director of the Bernosta Toyota management, said that if Britain left at the end of March, we would stop production in our factory.
The other UK manufacturers, including Honda, PMDU and Jacques Lane Rover, have shown their fear of leaving one European country unconscious about how the treaty will work.
For example, PMDU said that a month after Britain’s departure in the European Union, he would close his small business line at Oxford.
A major problem is car manufacturers say that if they leave the United States without a treaty, they will have the problems of sugar.
Doota's production method is based on "Just-in-time", and the parts of the arteries come from the utensils of YK and Europe each 37 minutes.
On March 29, when Yuke left the European Union without a treaty, the UK could be interrupted on the border, and that could result in delays and problems for the participants.
The Society’s organization has announced that the production could be halted, since only keeping up a day’s investment in its derbicier’s industry is more likely to keep up with the fuel for a day.
The exam plan for future connections with Mr. Clarke and Teresa Mayan, is that "When such tests are made, they will be accurately measured to avoid."
"We have to overcome a treaty. We need a better deal, that's not just a victory that we're going to enjoy, that's always the way it always uses," he said in the BBC Radio 4th Tutday program.
"Excuse the need for other car manufacturers, except Doota, that they can continue with the successful seeds that they have done."
Toyoto could not tell how long the production would be stopped, but for a long time, additional expenses were warned that more work could be reduced and lost.
Peter Destlellarys, who worked in Bernosst, for 24 years, is the UNIAN Kannada in a labor camp, and he continues to fear his team members: "In my experience, if we leave these jobs, they won't come back again.
The government newsmagazine said: “We have recommended a precise and reliable program for our future relationship with a European.
White hall reports that a trombling meeting with Rosinstein can be delayed
On Sunday, the White House stated that the most important meeting with the subcontinent of Freud Cavanauca, with Rod Rosselinstein, was to be made with a very important conspicuous meeting with the subcontinent of Rodald Drugstein, who said, "You can be put away for another week."
Rosinstein, who oversees the work of Robert Muller in the Special Council, and Robert Mouler, a researcher of the choice of Russia’s choice of transactions, contacts between doctors and Russians and the possibility of interference in the Supreme Court.
Although the tromb subscription did not remove the office from work, it has been searching for a month’s talks in Washington, as a result of an interference to the rest of the body’s freedom.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosinstein argued that wearing a driver to record immediate conversations and that Rosinstein argued that it was possible to remove the alarm according to the 25th law.
Rossinstein has rejected the message.
But in spite of the information he had to resign, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with the United Nations in their midst in New York.
Drumb said that he would not take Rosselin away, but later, one of the women who accused him of sexual misrepresentation delayed meeting with the St.
On Friday, he ordered a week’s FBI trial of requests against Kawana and delayed the complete Senate.
Drambin’s newsman, Sarah Santarz, appeared at Fax News Sand.
And when he was asked about meeting Rossente, he said: "It's no longer marked the date for it, and it may be this week, but in view of all the other days of the Supreme Court, it seems that it's going to be a week.
But let's see, I'd always like to tell you the current information to the news. "
Some newsmagazines would object to the idea: First, September 10 was not held in the white hall.
Host Christmas Wallace asked why.
And Sanders, the reason is that the news is rare because television news reports are not "to be commended" but they say, "I will not deny that he is doing this to please others."
Then he said that the direct communication between the people and the news would increase.
"The president is attending more than any president before him." He did not quoted the evidence, but he said: "We are counting the number that happened."
Sandors, they said, will only take short news meetings, and the newsers said, "If the president of America has the opportunity to ask directly questions, it will be better than ever to talk to me.
We're trying to do it a lot, and you've seen that we've done so much for the past few weeks, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, it's going to catch the journalist's location.
Drambs usually respond to messages when they leave the white hall or when they share in open public meetings or when they meet foreign delegates who are present at the meetings.
It is not easy to arrange for individual newsweek meetings.
This week, perhaps in New York, the president would have shown them a strange look before the news media, and they would have shown why.
People’s good workmates are writing to EU employees in NHS Scottish about the project
They wrote a letter to the EU servant of the NHS in Scotland, expressing appreciation for the country and wishing to continue with them after the Prague convention.
J. Freyman MSP wrote a letter when they were less than six months away from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already agreed to accept the expense of the colonial application for a European citizen who serves in his advanced public service.
Mr. Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, the words of talk between England and Europe have continued to be followed, and it has gone to the conclusions of this century.
However, England’s government is also holding on to the preparations of potential drowsiness.
I know that this will be a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize the extent to which I appreciated the part I had given each of the servants, not irritating their country.
Working with me everywhere in Europe has strengthened the work of health service, brought me valuable experience and skills, and rewarded the patients and communities we serve.
Scottish is your home, and we want you to continue with us."
Christopher Albertope is treated with a sense of emergency because of his head injury
They said that Christine Abergrombi, the leader of the Tennessee - Temple College, had been treated with emergency treatments because of the failure of the Wanderard Comandantes group in the event of Sunday 31 - 27.
The teacher of the tennisi State School, Rod Reed, told the newsers that his injury had occurred shortly before half an hour’s break.
"He's coming to the side of the road, and somehow he's fallen down there," said Reed.
Before he was put in a prefecture, the trainers, medical servants, and Abergorombia brought them a blood transfusion and brought them to the front.
One official from the Tennessee Stadium told them that they did not need surgery at WSMV in Tennessee, Denmark, at the Wanderbliffe Medical Center.
And Harris said that there's no description of the type of gas, and there's a tennisist studio that's trying to find out when this happened.
After being transferred from Illinois, Abergrompe, a second - year - old red - colored student, he was playing with the Tennessee State group in his early teens.
On Saturday, he had five bananas to get out of the game, and he had a total of 18 bananas.
When buying property in England, more security building will be scheduled for foreign - born foreigners
Under the new tortoises, when buying property in England to help uninhabited people with more money available, the safer recordings to foreigners who buying goods will be done
This action makes the effort to attract young watchmen nothing.
This safe recording is high in England, and the taxpayers are ordered to pay the tax in England
In order to help non - house - to - house workers, the organ expects that this type of nucleus increases by £120 million a year
Today, Teresa May will be able to help those who do not have a home.
This action was aimed at putting up with the success of the effort to attract young watchmen and to target the high - ranking.
In England, it is possible to determine the high cost of this security pay to individuals and institutions who do not pay taxes, and with that extra money, it can be a source of encouragement to the government’s activities to fight the situation of not having a home to sleep.
Extra tax - this is more than three percent of the current security pay, including additional taxes for the second - house buyers and customers two years ago.
It is expected that the government’s nucleus can collect £120 million a year.
Those who do not live in England have 13 percent of London’s newly built property purchased, raised prices, and made it very difficult for those who try to buy a house first.
Many of the richest parts of the country, particularly the capital city, became "bay cities" because most buyers are foreign and spend a lot of time outside the country.
A few weeks after Roberts Johnson called on most young people to help buy their first house, the new policy has been reached.
He accused them that big companies hold grounds and by not using it, Mr. May insisted that they dispose of the estate of homes that are under control of Britain's "difficulty."
Mr. Carbin next to their eyes, he has set up homemade reforms, which includes renting controls and bringing out the outgoing "normal".
He also wants to place more authority on the halls to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "I would dedicate my position to the fulfillment of the British dream, and I said that life should be the best of each new generation.
It means the refining of our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open - minded to those who want to live here, work, and build up their lives.
However, it would not be fair to say that it would be easy, like those in Britain who live in foreign - based institutions and who are hard - working.
For most people, the dream of buying a house for themselves has become unstable, and it has become a reality on the roads where there is no home."
JACK ROS: "My best intention is to manage Scotland."
Jr. Ross, president of the Swedish state, says she's "the goal of teaching" to become Scotland's administrator at the same level.
The Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of living by the North East Club, and now, he's in the top three points, in the third place, in Lee On.

I got a B cab, that's all, Ross BBC Scottland's Scotland.
"But with my father, I grew up in a number of Scottish games in Hampton, and that's something that brought me here.
The opportunity will come to me only if I succeed in the club management."
Among those who were before them, Ross, Dick Adogat, David Moyes, Sam Allerdius, Martin O’Neel, Roy Kine, Gus Piett, and Paulo de Canyo.
The former U.S. president of the Athletica Athletica said that he had no fear of following such major names in any of the major clubs that had previously rejected the advances from Barnesley and Isswis.
"Simplifying success to me at this time is the same as saying, 'Can I return to Bremiremer Lick?'
Because of the structure and facilities in this clerk, it is doubtless belongs to the Freemare Legal. ’
"It's not easy to go there, but if I can come back to that club, I'll see that I'm the winner."
Ross has been a coordinator in Tamperton and has served for 15 months as a trained minister for three years.
He was then under great pressure and helped to move to the third layer, and St.
In addition, Ross says that he was now more comfortable than when he was playing at the branch, Hartlebull, Falk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
When it comes to taking responsibility for Apollos, he remembers, "It may have been a real circumstance. ”
I was convinced that it was better for me to take care of myself than to play.
It seems strange, since I played a little better, lived a better life from which to say, and I enjoyed as much as I could.
However, playing can be difficult.
On the basis of your weekly schedule, there are many tasks you need to accomplish.
I still live in the same way as working and stressing, but when it comes to management, it seems right.
I have always wanted to do what I can, and that is what I now do, and this is the best thing I can do, and I am able to simplify my work as long as I am mature.

A bit of wine is a good time to drink, so on Saturday at 5.30 o’clock in the morning
The summer’s hot waves have fueled Britain’s debris, but food shortages have caused much distress on the foods.
Status has shown that in July the sale has increased 2.7 percent in the homes and drinking places, but the sale of foods is 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Department of Traffic Investigation, said: “In the current web, England shared more time than expected in the competition of the world, and the sales in the homes produced the same pattern as that of the past 2.8 percent, but the sales were even worse.
In June the sales of 1.8 percent of the foods dropped, and in July it was even worse.
Drugs, drinking places of drinking water, cooking, and cleaning were more effective.
Although the food - going iodines were greatly affected in the sun, they did not overreact, as did the drivers.
It seems that people are on the move to drink alcoholic beverages.
Everywhere, the sales of manufacturing homes and drinking places have increased by 6.6 percent during this month, and food sales have decreased by three percent.
The RSM Entertainment and the Enterprise Department researcher Paul Newman said: "The conclusions continue the same course we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to a house-out-fashioned market, the climate, and the impact of large - scale social or sports events were the greatest factors.
Although it is not surprising that the dietary groups continue to be deteriorating, 4.8 percent of the fall annually is particularly painful in the conservation crisis.
The long summer of summer, the food-production shouldn't have been a bad time for the drivers, and it's only time to tell them whether the temperature in August would give them greater relief.
The total sale of freshly opened wines and dishes was 2.7 percent in July, and this reflects that the sale of new revivals was slower.

One of five children has secretly kept a social media account without knowing their parents
The idea is that one of five children-- some of them are 11 years old, their parents and the Asians are not knowing how to keep social media accounts.
The view that conducted by the 20,000 higher scores of students/ students has been shown that the "Poliant Insta" pages have increased.
These messages increased the fear of posting sexual fantasies

A survey of 20,000 high school students and students showed that the figures of "Poliant Insda" were rapidly increasing - a reference to the Broadcast Institution of Photography.
These messages increased the fear that sexual harassment would be posted.
Twenty percent of students/ students said they had a clean "profession" account to show their parents and at the same time had personal accounts.
Suddenly, a 13-year-old mother went to the secret site of her 13-year-old child to see a 14-year-old girl begging her to "kill her".
A study conducted by the Digital Avernas Euca and Hetmosters (HMC) in the Digital Affairs and Free Textbooks found that 40 percent of 11 - to 18 - year - olds had a personal account, and half found that half of them agreed to have personal accounts.

Alith Toyle has chosen them to be the non-profit director of the Port of Scottish Athletics at the annual meeting of the Governing Body.
Toye is the most famous of Scotland’s tracks, and in the past decades, President Ian Pete said that this was a wonderful occasion for the benefit of those who led the game from a variety of international experience.
"The Society of Scotland, England, and the World Trade community has great respect for Alith, and certainly, the trains in Scotland will benefit by bringing him to the weekend."
Toye said, "I'm determined to be the sound of the trainers, and I hope I can share in the game in Scotland and help it."

And when he wrote in the Dairy: "A month ago, this day I got a fight.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor told me that the time would come when I would come back from this and that I would be back only for the rest of my life.
It was cruel training, but he has returned completely, learned how to walk, and today he has made rapid progress!
Thank you for those encouraging messages! ”
Snake advertisement that compares mothers to cows has created an online discord
An organization that prepares the breast - feeding industry has created an online discord by comparing mothers to milk - fed cows.
Introducing the bomb, which is the world's first sound, Elve, the technology firm Elve, published a new ball of videos to show the freedom of milk - sucking mothers.
In it, four mothers dance with the following songs in a violin garage: "Ang, I'm milking, there's nothing to come."
The starving continues: "Come, cry, I give to the children milk," and "Come, cry, I'm sucking my girls."
However, the advertisement was published in the Fasp of the country’s Fasp.
In fact, 77,000 people who saw and saw the video with hundreds of views said that it was a jesting of the booms of the Balkans.
"It's a bad conclusion to use cows to advertise this production.
One writer writes that they should be pregnant, bear children as we do, and go for a few days after they have received their donkeys.
Elvey doses the nectar ball to the ventilation provided by the mother (lvi/mata)
And another said: This is a punishment for the mother and for the child to understand.
Why not use one of them to sell breast milk for mothers who own it?
Another said: "This is an unmerciful advertisement."
Others bought the advertisement, and one of them said that this advertisement was "small".
"It's a clever idea.
If I had given it to my mother now, I would have bought one too.
I felt as if I were a cow.
This advertisement was a little stupid, but I took what it said.
It’s an intelligent preparation, ” writes one.
Another said: "It's like the funny advertisement of the mother-in-law (between milking or submarines) that's like "functions".
This is not an advertisement that commends or condemns the balancing industry.
At the end of the video, all the girls play with an unfamiliar ball.
The idea of this propaganda is that many females who suck milk through the pancreas say they feel as do babes.
However, this Elve pump is totally silent, and it does not have tires or pipes, and it does not fit into the milk - producing cell, which frees women to go free, keep their children, and even go out at the masturbation.
Participant and ECD at the Mars Institute, but Paran says: “This Elve pump is very revolutionary, and it is worthy of knowledge of courage and anger.
By revealing the unity between females and milked cows, we wanted to bring forth the mother’s cry and all its challenges, while at the same time, we demonstrated the freedom of the unbelievable amount of this new ball.
This was not the first time the Elvey Bombs came in the headlines.
During the London Fuffale Wheel, designer Marta Jackbovsky appeared in Katwa for them, using this preparation.
Hundreds of wild children came to a tent camp on the coast of Texas
Although the number of passengers who pass monthly has not changed to the same degree, the number of hand - to - handed children has increased greatly, making it difficult for them to add to those who have been introduced to the irritation system.
Traditionally, most supporters are known for what they have not recorded, and they fear that their responsibility to continue in this country will be nullified by their claiming to accept a child.
The danger increased in June because the media reported that the supporters and the elderly in their home had to record their fingerprints and share the data with the colonial authorities.
Over the last week, the president of the Methuselah Alphonse and the Swahili Department announced that a number of non - Witness youths were arrested in the theater to support non - Witness youths.
Then, when the face was expressed, 70 percent of the arrested were convinced that there were no previous crimes.
"Approximately 80 percent of the respondents or members of the supportive family are illegal in this country, and the majority of them are involved in criminal behavior.
So we're looking for them," Mr. Alphonse said.
While taking an extensive action on the children, some of them introduced new rules that were needed by a month of arrest and not for the 60 days before the immigration staff.
Most people will be present at the court by the call of the video Confusion rather than in a legal case.
Those who do not qualify for relief will soon be exiled.
According to the directors of the tabernacle, according to reports from the computer system in recent months, the amount of time children are in the care of their parents is likely to get tired and stress to the extent possible, and this may take time to try to survive ruthless acts or to survive.
An increasing number of such concerns are found in large - scale areas of Toronto, where there is a greater chance of losing sight of the signs of a staggering child.
It may be that taking children to the tent may be a luxuriant but not a time to prepare well and to give a reply to friends.
The country of Syria, the United States, the United States, the French, and the Turkish are asking for immediate excommunication.
While speaking in the United Nations General Assembly, the prosecutor Wallat Al - Mountain invited the Russian refugees back in the eighth year of the war.
The Majesty, the Reich, said that the foreign armies, in the battle against terrorism, are illegal in the rigorous soil and that they say, "We'll find the solution."
He said to them: "Away with them, let them depart without any restriction.
Silence, they said, "The war of terrorism is almost over in Syria," and 360,000 died from 2011, and millions of visitors have been known.

It is amazing to know what we know about their greatest success in Paddington.
He said that his father, who served as a Bibi Cameroon, was pained to see his creation rejected, with a little bit of a handful of ball and a little handbag that moved the children to write a book, and the 60th year of the book’s release ended, so after his death, he said that he had been "very sweet".
He said, "He's the most important member of our family." He said that he was proud of his father and his progressive success.
He said, "He was a little calm, and he wasn't a jerk."
"But because they were so real to him, it was to him when your child finished something: it seemed to you to be proud, though you did not do it.
I think he saw their success in that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always praised and gave them the pride they deserved.

Tragic Women in the Bridge to Prevent Suicides
In the United States, for example, the number of women who have lost a loved one in death has increased from 1 out of every 4 women to 1 out of every 10 children.
Sherean Davis and Kelly Hambrüys are both presenting cards on a Welsh bridge with positive messages and helpful phone numbers.
Miss Davis, their son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed and died at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to happen to me," he said.
Ms. Davis, a 45 - year - old girl in Lidney, said that her son would laugh at the next person’s face and said that he was a wonderful cooking artist.
"All men know him for his healing.
And they will always say, ‘ His smile will make any room bright. ’
Even so, before he died, he left the job because he didn't know what he was doing.
In 2014, at the time, his brother, Tyler, who was 11 years old, visited him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worrying that there's a result of it."
Miss Davis, they're the ones who created these cards, "Mes. Someone you're talking to, you're talking about."
"Don't sit quietly. Speak out."
Miss Homphry, who has been very friendly with Miss Davis for many years, lost his partner, who lived with him for 15 years before his mother died.
He said, "He didn't say anything, he was sad or depressed."
"We saw his change in a couple of days before Christmas.
On Christmas day, he was devastated. When children opened their presents, he didn't look at them nor see anything.
And his death gave them a great Book, which he had to bear. He said, “It has ruined the family.”
It was a two - and - a - half - year - old girl who had been in the hospital for about three years.
But we have to carry everything and fight against them.
If you are struggling to cope with the loss, you can contact the Society for free time, either by telephone, by telephone, or by mail, by mail, by mail, or by mail.org.
FBI starts the investigation, so the future of Brad Kwana is bleak
"What he asks us, and if we get it as it is - if we're going to be done within a certain period of time -- I thought we could bring some unity." Mr. Flück said that they weren't Saturday, and he, in the middle of the unchangeable barracks, he was afraid that the eagle was falling.
Why, Mr. Kawana and his Republican supporters don't want FBI inquiry?
They are intent on finding out the time when they will be able to do so.
There are only five weeks of interference, and if it failed on November 6 as expected, then they will be weakened in their efforts to find out whom they want to choose for the Supreme Court of the country.
Jorge W. Bush, called the Senates and took Mr. Kana, who served them at the White House for himself, through which he met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What will happen after FBI hit his report?
A survey in Senegal presents 51 records and 49 demographics.
Mr. Kawana is not aware that they will receive at least 50% of promises at the Senate Constitution, which will bring the president Mike Benz to the conclusion of the summit and lead him to confirm the Supreme Court.
Under the King GIMP, the number of exiters from North Korea has reached's fallout'
Seven years ago, a South Korean legal member said that since Kim Jung came into your reign, the number of those who left North Korea has fallen from South Korea.
Pointing to the information received from the South Korean Constitutional Church, Bark Biang - Cyuk, 1,127 died in the year 2011, compared with 2,706 in the year 2011.
Mr. Park said that the harsh limit between North Korea and China is the most important factor in the demand for ads.
The Bangangui did not openly express any ideas.
Most of those who left North Korea were eventually given the South Korean immigration.
In 1953, when the Korean War ended, Seoul said that more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border.
Most people flee through China, which is the longest border with North Korea, and it is the most secure part of the army of both Koreas (DMZ).
China considers immigrants from North Korea to be legalized and often forced into exile.
Relationships between North Korea and South Korea - and now both are in war - making significant improvements in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries gathered in Pineang for the talk, and the words of nuclear propaganda were centered on the prohibition.
This came after the historic meeting of the U.S. president Donald Drumb, and Kim Jong, which was held in the Singapore between them in June, and they agreed in broad terms in the direction toward the nuclear disaster.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Federation Minister Rey Young-Ho accused the American bans of being unsuccessful.
"With no hope in America, there is no hope in the security of our country, and under similar circumstances, there is no way to put down weapons first."
Nancy Pelocia, they say they're "spractical" and they say he's not worthy of the Supreme Court.
The head of the minority of the congregation, the fourth Pilgrims, says that Brid Kwana, who is appointed to the Supreme Court, is "a madman, ” and he is therefore undesirable of his animal nature to serve in the Supreme Court.
Bellows, they have expressed their opinion in a Saturday interview on the Texis Tribune festival in Auschwitz.
On Thursday, as Cana gave a witness before the Senate Judiciary Commission, he said, "I couldn't say that, but if a woman ever happened, I think they'd say they're crazy."
When Kawana and Dr. Christine Plassie Ford were 16 years old, he openly rejected the charges that he had sexually assaulted him.
During his opening report, Guanaana was deeply moved, sometimes almost blaming him, and discussing his family and the years he had studied in his high school.
He openly rebuked Demetriots at the concentration camp and set up the following angry liberties of Hitler’s election in 2016, and said: “It is a monstrous, constitutional murder. ”
In Bellocie’s statement, the Witness of Cana has proved that he is not qualified to work at the Supreme Constitution, for he said that his Witness is acting in a way that supports the Temperates.
He said, "I think he's losing himself because of those things, after the Clinton family and the Democratics."
When he asked the Peloiss if Kanawa was guilty, he hesitated to respond if members of the Temperates were more likely to take advantage of them, asking him if he would try to dispose of the canvas.
"This is what I say: if he doesn't tell them or the FBI, he's not only in the Supreme Court but also in the court where he's still standing."
Kanana is the judge of the D.C. supervision court.
They said that he was an old-time judge, so as a democracy, they were concerned about the laws or the laws of the Fortalebe, or the Rod V.
In his trial to confirm him, he was shocked to hear the question, Will you change some of the Supreme Court’s conclusions?
"It's not the right time to go to court," they said.
All women must fight against it.
This is a reasonable statement, which has been angered for months and years, and he can’t say it without crying.
"When we get angry, we cry," said Mrs. Steinerem, 45 years after me.
"It's not normal, isn't it?"
As he continues to say, a woman who was an official in some place was very helpful to me, and he even cried when he was angry, but he developed a gym that, when he became angry, began to cry, he would tell the man who was talking, "You may think I'm sorry.
He said, "I'm angry."
He said, “I’m going to tell you that I’m going to have to go. ”
I think it's a wonderful idea.
To a degree, we allow tears to express anger, for they are basically misunderstood.
One thing that I remember from my early work was that in a man - filled office, I was seen weeping in my unpredictable rage, and then, when I was always watching, an old woman grabbed my neck to the floor.
"They should never see you crying," I said.
They do not know that you are angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy because they made you.

It was a defeating contest.
He then realized that some of his supporters would pay him only $250.
They said: "Do they think I shall be granted respite?"
When he began his talk, saying that he was not going to start a formal campaign, he was deeply moved and had to aim customers over the delegates because of the very organization that made it very difficult for the people to support him.
When the journalists told him how he was behaved, Mrs. Schroeder said, "You might think I'd have had a nervous breakdown."
"You might think, Clevex is my carbohyd Spancer.
How do I remember what they were about to write in my tomb?
"Is she crying?"
