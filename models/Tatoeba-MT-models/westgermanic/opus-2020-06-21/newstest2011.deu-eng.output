What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know the full-democracy or the "conditorie".
The new headquarters of the capital from the series of ČSSD are evidently need to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the Praag Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Acktuálně.cz has a little "clipped" from the ČSSD, as they dominate the renowned noorse snake in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were on the rower.
The codated vocabulary, which was introduced by the Prague political elite in the painting era of the Upper citizen Championshiper Pavel Bém, has been rejected by some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, it was shown that the new races regarding these new terms do something in the dark.
They claim at least.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a newman in Prague's politics," said Lukáš Kaucký, the new Rules of Culture, to the test of the "Paten-Wortschatz".
However, the President of the Council also responded in a similar way.
For example, the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present me here, which I turn over again."
"On the other hand, I don't keep a lot of snake."
In June before the ODS election conference, the editorial work had published six terms, especially those who are notoriously connected to the Prague Magistrat, from the wordschatz, which had published the newspaper Aktuálně.cz.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "Great Prague Golfloch", "go into the conditorie", "Stiernacken", "Verrat der Hauptstadt" and "Blowing".
Three Prager Council rulers agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future Chief of Prague's schooling system, even though first promised his participation in the conversation, but didn't even stop the listener.
The fifth president of the Council, Petr Dolínek, refused the test.
"These things are no matter and how the civil democrats are talking to each other, I do not judge."
"For me is important how we understand ourselves in the framework of our programmes," he commented.
As already stated, Lukáš Kaucký had supposedly not known in the above-mentioned headline that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the Ex-Oberburgermeister Bém, Roman Janoušek, was speaking.
The term "Foldemort" says Kaucky nothing and the only term he found correct during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the tunnel of Blanka," says Kaucký, but added to security, "but I know more about the newspaper."
And hardly, "I will probably need to be a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then dispatched not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the director of the Council for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel of Blanka.
Both social democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands, and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and thus what it means "to go into the conditoria".
"I think that is going to any Prague gastronomic business," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution when you know it is about the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In accordance with Březina, however, he stressed that he had created this knowledge rather from the newspaper than that he would be his own vocabulary.
The test participants seem to have no similarly incurred snake among the social democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but apparently there is no such thing with us."
"We call us in the name, we also use accelerators or nicknames again," says the president of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - by his party partner salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know whether my colleagues call me this," Karel Březina tells us his nicknames.
The newspaper Deník Acktuálně.cz has tested the name and see there - he works.
Counciler Weinert is friendly to the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Alte", the representative Miroslav Poche, who made attention to the party-sponsoring before the elections by Machenschaften, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego-Figur).
Nickers are the only one that allows the social democrats to be used in the internal party language.
Hulínský is not supposed to be called "Hulda", but Deník Acktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague president.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Centrum Rights" is supposed to be done by Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to interfere with the torture of "Hexen" and gave out a brochure
Women who are labeled to hexen in Burkina Faso usually show some common social characteristics.
They belong rather to the older generation, they do not find work - for example for healthy reasons, they are idle and have no children.
If one of these women will "will be" she will be strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Mans are very rarely affected by this fate."
"According to young and healthy women, as they help with work and bear children," one order sister describes the situation that takes place in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home of more than one hundred women who were extruded by their communities.
The local government now decided to deal with this abnormal "social measures".
And for this reason a brochure revealed that the "Hexes Tracking" should bind.
But the thing has a hake.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper "the standard" points to the dilemma of written statement.
Hexing has been seen as well as in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured from three women and two men to death - they cast them over with Petroleum and simply sang them.
This incident also reported the server BBC.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter was only a meeting of unhappy circumstances.
According to your version, oil was exposed to be used for ritual salmons.
And even after the group tried to "reject a wicked spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without prejudice to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Frees of human souls are previously a danger like today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least striving to deteriorate the hexenjagd, the Gambian President in the past year of the President has commemorated himself fairly.
"Präsident Yahya Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, emptied a monarchy hexenjagd, as this supposedly shared their deaths and now tried to kill the presidents themselves by black magic."
"To that end, he called for Shamane to help from near Guinea, who led women and men from the villages of Gambian and led to the farm of the president in Kanilai", said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the incredible people were forced to drink an excess of plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also resulted in immigration and kidney problems.
Two of the entreated people did not survive their stay on the farm.
Only due to international pressure, the nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A Rentant of Bakala: He heated in the oven - yet pays higher rents
An elderly undertooked man just leaves the client center of the Society RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in Czechia.
Under the arm a mappe with three new rental contracts for three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is just forbidding a liability penalty.
All three were just increased the rental in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rents, the son will be buried for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crones.
"And there is not even flowing warm water in the apartment and healing in a simple coal oven," he exhorts with the finger on the new rent contract of the son, to which he has a complete signing.
"But what--I have signed," he agrees half and resigns half.
The BytyOKD.cz civil society, which called the new rent conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7th, which it reminds a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just wins off.
"One says this, the other," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava will be the large "deregulation labor".
After the new year, this deregulation occurs most of the rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not pay market-righteous rents.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havanaov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clocks this Tuesday breaking full.
In addition to the door, the bodyguards are a security agency and a calling device.
"May 2011", then a special keyboard field illuminates on the touch screen.
Shortly typed and the device already picks out a number set.
Soon we have dismissed the number "157" and already peep it on the big display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
A half a second later you're on the line.
Somewhat later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room does not seem to be the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and similar.
From the middle of November, in the region of Ostrava the Kuverts with the new rental contracts, most of the tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio into the letter boxes.
The RPG Byty suggests a lease increase of about 15 to 38 percent in writing.
The special switch for the new rentals in the customer centre has been opened since November 18th.
"The action runs something over a week, which means that is only the beginning," the ladys respond after a moment after the switch, when the "Client" is dispensed as journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a brilliant theme.
Before the elections, the President of the parliamentary officer Lubomír Zaorálek had quite no wonder that the newspapers are full of that issue today.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even bad. WC brilles could change," the in-off man air makes himself.
Until now, the employees are particularly looking at pensioners on the switch to convince whether they really receive the promised remuneration that promises them when they are signing the special offer timely.
In the enjoyment of a half reduced February rents, the other tenants should come to sign the new rental contract until December 15th.
Until now, "deregulation switch" is in Havanaov everything else but overloaded by demands.
"From the art 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rentals in 2011 because of here," the switch officers appreciated.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both websites and wall tables where necessary.
However, if the rent parties are not on the new rent, it is set by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat but is to understand as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its websites.
"There is no one before the court," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the customer centre gives her at least partially right.
"I have 13.000 (Crones) pension, of which I stay 5,000 for food, where I should make the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee will be uncertain.
"See me."
"Herr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and thus wait for people yet," they remember.
The regulated rental ends in most of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty, the increase in the rent is an economic need.
"The existing height of the rentals is not enough for maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing RPG Byty company's apartment portfolio and - just the renewal criticized by the farmers' refusal of the housing fund is the main basis for increase of the rental.
During the years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments, in which four years from 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-formated LCD display on the ceiling across the polster seats in the Havana's waiting room, a few red illuminating information between time and time.
"The increase in rentals in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"Immer means this up to 7.50 CZK per square metre and month," is read on the LCD monitor.
Only at 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio, the rental increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about the increase in extremely lower rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments, the rent remains at the same level in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not lead the rentals to the height in progressively within four and eight years.
What more – the company is making up is another obligation: all revenue from the increase in the rent (see chart) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings – in new windows and in the heat reduction.
However, it is important that these should benefit from those who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw a - the office also belongs to a children's garden
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But who would already expect a mini-children garden here, with all this: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing place on the outer terrace.
This children's garden has been available to Arch.Design employees last year.
The projection and architecture office Arch.Design, from which Ateliers are a series of well-known brünner buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the spaces for its company minikindergarten.
In a wise precautions, because most of his 90 employees (myns) are located in the baby tree age, and the company is able to return project agents and architects to their work as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of shortening, the children's garden is another bonus to offer the Arch.Design its employees in the concept of their social programme.
The engineers and architects have so much easier to bring their demandable care and their child care under a hat.
The minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management of the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational minikindergarten is financed by the Operation Programme for Human Resources and Employment Policy from funds of the European Social Fund and from the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (subsidy of 2, 8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment could be provided, and for the duration of 2 years, qualified personnel and operation is provided for.
After the use of the funding resources (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to operate the minikindergarten 3 more years at own costs.
The preparation of this project took account of a whole year, providing the Company with an effective assistance in the development of the application.
To the children, they are fully qualified staff - a nurse and a child garden teacher, the childrengarten can visit children without elderly restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since there is a mini-children garden, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day is changing across several children.
The childcare business is flexibly agreed to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the child garden, without prejudice to the company's hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-children garden is still similar to the pre-training framework programme.
The children are not only playing here, especially for excellent teaching - from basic insights to pre-school education, along with learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
At any time, the parents can take a look at the children and thus deprive the stress when the children are late to pick up from a far away children's garden.
The parents therefore use their working time productive.
No wonder here that natural and loyal employers' relations are also characterised here.
Arch.Design acted in this way among the Czech companies who offer significant benefits in the application of new employees, who are family friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programmes.
A bone house is also fascinated after 100 years. See Gaudi's interiors.
The roof muds like the back of a prehistoric emotion, the stairs like the whirls of a dinosaur and the balconies are extinct fish monuments.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From these inhabitants, the house with its organic forms received the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles and mosaics, the facades and all-thisy soft lines, all this are typical features for Antonio Gaudi's youth style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remember nature and living.
First, when you see more precisely, it is noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm, and suspicious order.
In the night the whole facade has even more plastic, dramatic and special lighting strengthens the gloss of colors.
The same sweating lines and diversified forms also dominate the inside of the house.
Well-like wood copys the window frames, lands, boil elements of doors, even holes and performances.
The house Batlló in the district of Eixample on the occupied shopping road Passeig de Grácia Nr. 43 was created by the transformation of a house from 1877, which led to architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the prosperous industrial Josep Batlló, was originally on the breakdown of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to Gaudí's idea on an unusual and cheaper transformation.
The house of Casa Batlló did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the realist owner and also the use of mosaics on the fassade were his idea.
At the design of the fassade, however, many more pictures and artists also worked with.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the Güell Park, where there were other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Soon after his completion, the house was given by the local residents of his organic forms because of the nicknames "Knochenhaus".
Others again called it the special window opening mechanism for the "governing house".
It is also said that on top of the building the sword of the Holy Georg, the Patron of Catalonia.
However, other figurative elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with discharge channels and typical fireplaces for the time.
Something bizarr already encourages her 45 degree retreatment.
In the case of his sheep, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations at that time and could not be accompanied by them.
Before construction, he took the appropriate construction approval from the city, but the information he made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so disturbed of the result that they had required aid.
Among other things, the Heads of the Council also found that the construction with its pillars even took place in the public stage.
However, no more changes were made, in contrast - only 15 days after the calling for the district of the city, Josep Batlló gave him an application for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was quickly granted.
The owner himself entered the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor, there was a companylon, on the third floor the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was deposited to a jewelry business.
The entire six-stage building runs a staircase up to the roof terrace.
All right angle and straight lines were deleted by the basic elements of the transformation and replaced by curved and swollen walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salontures, so a larger society could easily be placing without a certain intimacy in confidential discussions.
The house also received a very unusual roof and two other floors by Gaudí's transformation except for a new facade.
Impressive is also Gaudí's game with light, as well as the blue and white glassed tiles, with which the courtyard is clothed and the light courts.
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum measure of light.
He made it easy to use the principle that White reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sun light in the opposite way.
The house Casa Batlló, which was recorded in 2005 to the Unesco World Heritage List, can visit everybody today.
In the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent public apartment is made accessible.
The household owners decided to get to this step in the year and this from the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When you found that this is a fairly inappropriate business, the visits were kept, and it was also extended to further common and roof floor rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for the visiting of the building is not a carton, but it is 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist exhibitions to receive 20 percent reduction.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí walls in the city.
Those who want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers should try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him home.
The right mattress and the right bed rost? Women have other desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lie area - so matratze and rost make the good bed.
However, these must complement harmoniously to meet the desires of the specific user.
In the selection, many things play a role - weight, size, health status and not least the sex of the sleeper.
The interior in which matratze and rost are undergoing is also equally important.
Typical example?
In a weekend home where no regular healing is made, Latex mattresses are not suitable because they need much longer to become warm.
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan mattresses.
And they should be used regularly.
If they don't have enough ventilation channels in the core and are still on a fixed plate, they say humidity: so it is not excluded that they are forming under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are pleased.
Those who were longer in the abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will hard to win on a low mattress with hard surface.
"When all the iceockey players who have come back from the NHL, I'm afraid that they can't be able to sleep right here."
"For their shooting shoulders, hips and hips, they just need a soft layer from Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam - a form-dought-polymer)."
"I recommend that, among other things, sugar illnesses may suffer from the disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the gentles and the skin badly," says Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes on polar hobs.
That's why I have been concerned with many iceockey players for years ago, but other customers also care about these mattresses with Visco-Saum (Memory Foam).
"This is not a problem anymore, because such matrates include the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily need to be a famous ice ockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco shaum.
This "Wunder" works very simple.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise said, he regularly approves the warm body.
Nowhere it's pressing, the night you're not wandering around like a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection from decubitus (Wundbrand).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still count the length of the soils of the foot, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Mann like woman, who is large at 180 cm, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm of lime width, along with 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, 120 to 140 cm are fit.
Des comforts half and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the flag rule applies to the ideal bedwidth: "If you are on the back, you should be enough space for the light angled arms," counsels Ing. Helena Prokopová, the chairman of the Polsters and room exhibitors who have been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and present this topic also to special schools.
With a double bed, each one needs its own rost and its own matrates, but watching when shopping, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else remains than mounting the rosts in different heights and that is long not possible at each bed frame.
Shamacomtrats should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feathers 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be detached on the shape layer and the fine pool.
"The feathers must not feel any case with the hand or the suspension," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rost type.
Fullly pooled beds with mattresses and subsides such as grown Siamzwillinge have nothing to search in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and you can't wash the reference what has already been done and done today.
And since one night is lost between 0,2 to 0,75 l sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the matratze will slowly become an enormous (and hiding Sieb).
This also rejects experts advertisinglogans who promise a lifetime of up to 25 years in matratzen, even life-long warranty.
Every thing she has and But.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: In 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shake the hygiene of washable detachable relations, yet it recommends to use a mattrate shoe that can easily detach and wash.
Even today, although mattress relations are usually made with roundumbrush, so that after opening two halfs (immens important for washing and washing machine size) it encourages manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the inequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in the bed instead of a rost?
That's it!
Or maximum for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
They should also prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if not already in it) and mattresses with feder skull and 15 cm minimum height with sophisticated pockets and fine pools.
Polyurethan mattresses are not included in such an undercover.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. combinations of Latex and Cokos) are always suitable for non-adjustable late-18 feathers (e.g. combinations of Latex and Cokos) with a larger latte number, i.e. 28 and more feathers, with Lordosen support in the Lendenwirbel area and the possibility to regulate the latte ports.
On adjustable lamellenrostes, no mattresses with feathers belong, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the setting of the feather bars, special flexible skouer modules are also required.
This involves a special fixation of the feathers, which allows you to impress the feather bars or even to turn around so that they allow the punctual instinct of the locker's shoulder.
One important thing for men with broad shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area.
It is also thought of the ladies - they can be given these soft zones in the housing area.
For the most demandable customers, pointlastic wing systems (Lattoflex) or rost with pointlastic contact paths with so-called multitorsion Federation.
The pressure is distributed to several points, reducing tension.
But if you use a bad (to large and filled) headaches to the right mattress and right rost, most benefits are lost again.
Here too, a fingerline: the head boxes are supposed to support the head, its tops should only reach the shoulders, so that the shoulders can relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm large kiss, as it likes the Scandinavier.
In the side position, the headache (as well as the school discharge zone in the rost or soft zone in the matratze) should equate the level of shoulder.
Something have meant our modern mattresses with the once (filled with throat) straw socks.
Modern manufacturers use ever more frequent natural materials or at least their congestions.
The new magic word "Bio" is also known as Matratzen.
Instead of oil raw materials, it is used for the production of polyurethane juices, as well as natural oils, for example rice and soya oil.
So yes, all of the well-known manufacturers are probably used.
"Bio is called for mattrates, which are their core of materials purely natural origin," says Petr Vašíček from the company Tropic Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
You can also eat micro capsules that are spreading fresh forest or lubricant juice during the sleep.
Here, too, one makes a difference between man and woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used in the case of men to absorb the heat and cool the body, the relations for women "heating" have effect.
Extractions from red paprika shocks rain the blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm while sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Matratzen from Kaltschaum (he has larger pears with destructed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much flexibler).
The combination of the various steifs (hears) of calfs and visco sleeves creates multi-zone matrats that know exactly where heads, hips and distances are located.
For a high quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to tackle.
However, health contacts are usually charged with less value added tax as they are considered to be medical aid.
The first Czech company was shared by Gumotex this advantage.
You see saving on the matratze and the rost is not so easy.
On the other hand, there are special offers by manufacturers and distributors that offer two matrats for a price of one.
Thus, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress duofreeze in terms of scattered Visco-Saum Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic tempo.
No miracle, they were developed for NASA, because astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the beginning.
Tempur becomes soft at warmth, in cool environment it is fastened again.
Thus it fits perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure optimally.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used, however, not only in mattrates but also in other health products, such as in special footwashers, which should provide relief for legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers, for example, use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human supervisory devices to have children under control
The fear of their own children grows and thus considers more and more parents to monitor them by GPS.
The system which was originally discovered for car fishing can be as good people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently as when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappears.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette bracelet but soon it may not be greater than a bracelet clock.
Many people have put the case of disappearing anička into fear and fears and thus keep them looking forward to protect their children by means and ways.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to say that there is nowhere here about return pioneers but an effective means to reduce the likelihood that it comes to tragedy," Petr Pilin from the Macro because, one of the suppliers of GPS location equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that in the individual case there can be misuse of such devices, for example, if you put it into the bag without knowing that, but we had no such case yet."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
However, his opinion is that the child should always know what purpose the "Schachtel" serves and how to use it in emergency.
But the children's psychologist Dana Bočková suggests that a child, if it does not like to wear such a thing, it simply disappoints him.
"Average very small children show great creativity when it comes to lose certain things deliberately if they don't want to be controlled."
"Show the mobiles wake up great expectations with the parents, but they can turn off as easily as these new supervisory devices," says Mrs. Bočková.
It is also considered that such an institution is actually helping in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned retreats, the Kidnapper always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be borrowed."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such supervisory instruments are more widely used, they would also look for them because their sales were safely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the police criminals are always a step forward," says psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
Roberta Čech from the RC Monitoring society, offers local services both for automobiles and for persons, can also help the existence of such a device if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set so that it records the respective position in some intervals."
"If it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"For more expensive devices, even a slight measuring measuring is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and remain loose, the device immediately sends a warning under the position," claims Mr. Čech.
His opinion might also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, but only one needs to play a special software.
The problem of the current location equipment is that it is either about devices in trick wooden tub size, similar to followers or smaller mobile phones.
It always exists the danger of losing them.
Mr. Pilin of the Macro Because according to the fact, you are testing devices that look like normal digital tubes.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognise that it is a monitoring or location device.
"or he notices that after a certain period of time that the police give a time spring," he adds.
No matter what direction the development goes - to armbands or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So around the combination of location function with the GPS system (genauso as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone reporting the current position.
The army has so many petrols that you could re-establish throughout the Czech Republic but only keep two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of thin doors, wrenched with casts.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometers of thin to army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the forces have provided 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the petrol - two, but at least four years.
The army bought the petrol by the share company STV Group, n.e. for long-term 40 million crowns.
In its reasoning for purchasing this huge amount of petrol, the General tab MF DNES answered that the soldiers would use to the 60 kilometers of petrol.
According to the test of army pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES said that the whole army had to complete an extremely intense pyrotechnical training every year - from all the generous and defence of the army command, to the secretary and prudents.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and Armegenal Vlastimil Picek not exempt.
Only so, the remarkable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignorance has been justified halfways.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But also these army stocks would be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that, for the training of every new professionalsoldate, two meters of ignorance, the army has created a restant stock for the already mentioned 225 years, even under the face of the increased demand of pioneer and special units.
Soldiers recently complained to the Defense Minister Vondra that they wouldn't have any more vessels for hand-powers, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are severely restricted.
To swear from the underhosen lack.
"I don't mean why she buys such abundances of ignorance."
But that is finally her decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us the army is a good customer that we want to meet as a dealer far-reaching," says the STV Group's sales manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Defense Ministry, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of thin, that the army would have covered ten years with this "Munition".
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year-old use time of the petrol and police and army pyrotechnicians just over two years.
"For perfect storage, even the four years mentioned," admits one of them who wants to remain unnamed to be considered as a soldier not the criticism of army.
After the expiry of the period of use, any munition must be carefully tested whether it is yet reliable and not threatened by the soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not otherwise, but costs further money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the amount of rabatt for the 445 km of ignorance.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," speaker Pejšek tells us the view of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of pyrotechnicians from the police, the munition from the second world war or the Soviet brother's army has been liquidating barely 1.500 meters for a few years.
And the police always orders only such quantities of this munition, which they can still use before the expiry of the period of use.
Even for the safety of pyrotechnicians, in addition, the possibility of flexible purchases of moderner and so also reliable ignition is open.
The Ministry of Defence has no doubt huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of munition from times of the Warsaw Treaty when the two hundreds of the Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared to their field move to the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnicians who spoke to MF DNES, Czech forces in a few years expect the same problem in liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old innocence, which it has so "goodly" today.
Until today, the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
Lukáš Pytloun has helped to sell the franchise of his hotel in the winning position in the competition of "Klein Entrepreneur of the Year".
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec became winners of the last year of the competition of "Klein Entrepreneur of the Year".
The history of his success is like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun was happy to travel.
First in the abroad, he became aware that liberec lacked at reasonable prices at good overnight opportunities in Liberec.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan he found a building home with five apartments.
If you remember that he was at that time a student in the sixth semester, this was surely a courageous discipline.
"The price quality ratio at that time entrusted me and so I tried to do something against it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he renewed to foreign workers.
The whole profit he invested immediately again into the house, which he then rebuilded step for step-by-step to the pension with 54 beds.
He has been able to open four guests in Liberec for just seven years, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another best hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and have already reported further interests at the Franchise of the Pytloun hotels," says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"Great share in this license sale for the business of hotels had just added the win in the competition "Entrepreneur of the year", Mr. Pytloun added recognisingly.
The victory has brought him greater knowledge, yes popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the street, often gratulated me even afterwards, and I have to say that did well," he remembers.
I really recommend that all who want to create something are participating in this competition.
You don't need to win the same, every visible presentation is good.
He says that until today he benefits from the contacts and notes to whom it would not have come.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I shall keep regular business relationships until today."
The fame associated with the success is thought to be a little down on each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
"I noticed more loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something to be shared by general recognition."
I really do not see this as a personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just in the front," says Lukáš Pytloun modest.
My followers would wish a more quiet year than we had it in Farmet.
The Siegeseuphory was quickly dissolved by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst behind itself.
The price for the first ranking of the competition Vodafone company last year took Karel >>eng<<árský, the farmet company owner.
At that time, the jury valued the efforts he made from the small tool construction in Česká Skalice, a company from the ground that made hundreds of million revenues.
"I can say that this regret is not only me myself, but also all my employees encouraged and strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight with competition," says the previous year winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet, the effort was to do something useful.
And when the State then offered his father Karel õárský as a compensation for the property employed by the Communists a small workshop for the pacht, he did not delay long, his career in the company, where he was busy until then, and founded with a few cameras of his father a private company for the production of plastic weapons.
A short time later they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success of the abovementioned competition and its medialisation it also entered into consciousness of non-practical publicity.
"Not only that our customers are now making the farmer more intense, also our foreign partners began to work together with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country to measure greater value," says Karel õárský.
The past year, however, was not only in the sign of the Siegeseuphory at Farmet.
The reduction was due to the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just in 2009, the most difficult year was for sale of tool construction products.
The crisis at that time, which shaken even less the citizens, but, above all, firms, reached its highest point - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and limit the purchase of new institutions and technologies.
"Of course we couldn't escape this situation."
"The revenues decreased by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even take releases," explains Karel ›árský
A living company may sometimes have to take such unpopulary measures.
However, the situation was managed to handle and keep the company in the black figures, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not to discharge - in investment in research and development.
"With the grant, we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation on international fairs and acquired major prices for domestic exhibitions," says ›árský.
Everything proves that we've overcome the crisis.
The revenues grow again and with them also the number of new employees.
"The new winner I wish a lot of joy in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel ›árský explains.
A survey that arises with inconspicuous rules
The survey on the "safety of the year" is part of the entrepreneur competition for the fourth time.
Some insaneous rules have already been able to create from the world.
The doubtful winner of the next year's next year of the survey of "Activity of the Year" authorised the duty to create documents on authorities that are available to the online.
Thus, more than one third of non-four thousand stimulating entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the Social Security Manager demanded a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could call him through two clicks.
Thanks to the survey, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Insurance Management will not require any extra extracts from the trade register in the future," said the speaker of ČSSZ Jana Bura\ová.
The purpose and purpose of the survey of the "absurdity of the year" is to take all the rules and arrangements under the lupe, to meet the entrepreneurs in Czech Republic and to raise the insaneous.
This is already the fourth part of an entrepreneur's competition that is organised by the German economic newspaper (HN) and is delighted in the public of growing popularity.
When the three thousand were participating in the vote last year, there were already four thousand in this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hinder business activities.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a front ranking in the world," notes Karel Hailíček of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activities is the proclaimed objective of all governments in recent years.
However, in comparison with the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, Czech Republic takes the 74th ranking, compared to the previous year, a more bad placement by eight places.
The competition of the year was first exclaimed in the year and plays down each year after the same scenario.
Each man may report administrative and bureaucratic instinct from April to the editorial conclusion of the competition at the end of September.
The Web address www.firemaroku.cz will then search for the competitor of the competition for seven candidates for the "Anti prize" and allow the public to vote on the websites www.firemaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the suspicion that gets most of the votes.
For this year's survey, more than a hundred have already been logged in, more than 105 senseless rules and arrangements.
The tips are not only by entrepreneurs but also by professional associations and journalists.
For example, under the nominated "Finalists" of the competition, there are provisions that maintenance vehicles for carbahns and highways have to pay walls or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets must present every two years.
The list of the "Seven" of these years is published on the sides of the competition.
The excerptation of competition at the Prague Wenzelsplatz is part of a happening, which regularly shares personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and commercial operators of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, the President of the Trade Chamber of the Czech Republic, at the highest point of competition with the party.
"Where the State brings the entrepreneur into the legs, there can be no real economic excisement, so it is my goal to eliminate at least thirty paragraphs every year, which are still unnecessary to the entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade with them.
The efforts to create insults from the world show effect.
In 2007, people mostly suspended the entrepreneurs' duty to report three days in advance to the commercial office in the place of their permanent operating site in advance to drive with an exhibition position to an exhibition or cherry.
This duty has been repealed in a Novelle of the commercial law.
The duty that received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the Working Office of Employers up to 30 days - was dismissed by the law on her so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
In 2009, the Regulation was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal waists in the speaking room.
This Regulation was somewhat miiled by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator duty was lost.
A new category worth socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education and sports projects
A newness in this year has already been fiveth year of competition in economic newspaper (HN) is the category of responsible company in 2010.
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile firm Vodafon, the exhibitor and warrant of this competition, as well as the competition "rebell of the year".
To this year's first year, this special sub-categorie of the main competition Voody Company of the year reported companies for which success is not the only long-term target.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirational and kills enough material for a self-employed article.
Although they are diametrically different in the subject of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator support and consideration.
Here, for example, are disabled people, because personal problems or health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague Software Company Et Netera, which promotes the development of formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports.
Another example of a responsible company from Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a Fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also comes to its healthy disabled workers, which represented 70 percent of her work for which she was worthy of the third ranking in the competition of Vodafone's company in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the bookkeeping company MiRyz Soft found, which, for example, introduced a flowing and also reduced working time at an average of 35 hours per week, without relative reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company is mainly buying in Czech manufacturers, supports civil initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We try to recycel as much as possible to keep the consequences of our entrepreneur's activity and administration for the environment as low as possible," explains its director Miluše Ryznarová.
The most responsible IT company Enlogit from the region Ustí nad Labem is located on the health of his employees and therefore it has created them to all notebooks ergonomic sessel and keyboards, and it also promotes their employees' homework and uses cartering services offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the "Menschen in Not" Foundation which provides specific assistance to this Roma community," says Ondřej Searchý, representative of the company.
Not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region, which contributes to their pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
"We give our employees contributions to the nursing, working paths, to increase their skills and for vacation," says Joseph Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Malish-Schlesian region.
The most responsible company of the year was automatically logged in to all district financiallists of the Vdafon Competition Company of the year, which answered the questions of the application and sent it to the organiser at the latest until 15 August.
False or incompletely filled answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the rating by the organizer.
"When the representatives of the law-making companies left unreplied questions, they were excluded from the competition "the most responsible company of the year", in the main competition Vodafone company of the year, but they were not disqualified for this reason."
"Only a separate registration is not possible for this competition because it is only a sub-categorie of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organisational Agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in public awards
In the building of the soil fund in Pilsen, anticorruption police took place in the last days.
The media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was released by the detectives in handclubs.
This was supposed to have tried to manipulate a competitive public competition in order to develop restitution claims in such a way that the grounds offered in competition to a concrete interested person.
This should have paid Luboš G. a half million for this.
"To this time, I can only confirm that the police pursue a person because of the delicate deceit of fraud in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner state lawyer of the newspaper "Právo", could not give further details about the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In what way it could manipulate public competition, it is only possible to speculate in view of the spearly official information.
The speaker of the Lubomír Černá's soil fund led to the question of Právo, and the police had actually taken arrests in the Pilsner side of the Fund for Confederation and this during public competition.
"It was a client and with no one of our employees," she concreted.
According to the public competition, Ms. Černá had the correct name "requirement for awarding claims for the transfer of grounds in accordance with the soil law" and would take place in cases where several applicants were interested in the property offered.
"These persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be compensated through the transfer than the exclaimed ground value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential acquisitioners is set, then the soil fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. was evidently available to the person who had logged in for the request and since he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a fundamental interest in the competition.
Apparently against a fat invention.
This would also be an adequate statement why he had such a large amount in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former Chief of the Václav Sankota Construction Fund, which was pursued by criminal law, because he found grounds to which site decisions have already been made for construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. from the soil fund, for example, acquired more precisely landpieces intended for the construction of public roads, in the place where the construction of the tariffmagistral was planned to the sector of Borské Pole.
Later, he exchanged this very cheap with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which exceeded the value of the grounds.
The Rathaus had to give hard hearts of the building project at that time not to threaten the blocking of the grounds.
Budgets' housing costs rise by a few hundreds of months
The budgets have to be expected not only for all kinds of energy, but also for higher water and wastewater fees and for remote warmings and some locations also grow the rents.
Families will have to draw more from the wallet from several hundred crowns from January than before.
The current will take up to 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay more for water delivery and some locations also devote remote warming supplies.
The households cost more than a few hundred crowns each year only.
The high current prices were reduced by all the main suppliers, thus the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic plants.
Although gas will only be moderater, this is exactly when people need to heal most and have the highest consumption.
So here is more than a few hundred crowns per year here.
While electricity and gas become more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for remote warming are different from city to city.
Above all, larger places plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more than 50 crowns from January to January, more than 1000 crowns per year pay for families in Liberec.
At the same time, the city's residents threatened 9% of higher water and wastewater fees, and this is the case that the city increases the infrastructure rentals.
If the rental is not changed, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague continues to be the lowest in comparison with the entire Czech Republic.
In the northern tree where the prices are already among the highest, water and waste water charges are expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
Enormous increases in rent are, for example, expected in 140,000 rent apartments, where the so-called regulations are removed from January.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Uestí nad Labem, plans to increase the rentals from January by a hundred percent.
Those who do not agree with this increase of tenders want the company legal interests.
The regulated rents, which are still paying in nearly 3000,000 apartments, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with Fernet and Rum Bier is out - it works simply too slow
Fernet, Rum and Wodka, exceptionally also a good whisky that you stole the father out of the house bar.
These are the drinks which have to be treated most frequently after the enjoyment of Czech teenagers under the age of fifteen.
No exception is children who have to sleep out their cats repeatedly in the hospital.
This results from the experiences of doctors which are confronted with similar cases in taking up the children's departments of clinics.
"Bier or wine are completely out of fashion because it just lasts too long until you drink."
"The trend today is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of the children's department in the Middle-Böhmic Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it manages to escape the father a bottle from the pet, and if not, then at least remote net or wodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix him with Juice, then he does not cry so strong," explains the bossian.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right.
"The most common thing is Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, namely at basic schools."
"Individual it was also about Slibowitz, which you take from home," Mrs. Jurnová led.
According to head doctor Pelikán, 13 or 14 years old drinkers in hospital consumption are not an exceptional seem.
He worked for ten years before he was in the Motol Hospital department for the ten years before he was working since this year, where the rescue cars delivered from Nah and Fern.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began with 12 years when she was first delivered with 3,5 promilles of alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "Extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition site in Holešovice at any dancing party."
"It was interesting that her mother didn't even feel strange that her daughter did not come home for 48 hours," the bossman wonders.
Just the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when stroke with their own speakers is one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
In order to be real dependence in the true sense of the word, experts do not act at children.
"Below alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all the related phenomenon, and that is not the case with these children."
For those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, it is mostly a negative family social background characteristic," says Chef Pelikán.
According to M. Jurnová, the speaker of the Municipal Hospital has been assigned some 40 children to the National Department for Children and Youth Medicine until mid November.
However, only the cases with heavy alcohol poisoning that required a hospital stay go into statistics.
Drinking children who are brought home after ambulant treatment by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
Apart from the cases where children only drink a bottle of snaps in the school bank, Mr Pelikán believes there are three year-old amplitudes to which a hundred percent is released: Walpurgisnacht, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The latter was for two reasons - either for grief because of bad witness or for joy in vacation."
"In the Walpurgisnacht I have already experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording," said Doctor Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better than a child who has to fight only with an unpleasant cater on the next day.
The headaches of the morning after which the dehydration and the lack of glucose occur, can be distributed in the hospital with a liquidity-dispensing infusion with glucose and nutrients that fail to organism.
"They're clearly better draining, because after the "girful" experience in the evening, they wake up with good laune without hurting somewhere."
"They are only something confused about where they are," says Doctor Pelikán, with at least by deluding the patients by counting them the costs they will cost the treatment.
For transportation with the rescue car and the night in an acoustic bed comes well and enjoys a few zig thousand crowns.
"Hin and again I used this as an educational tool, when I predicted the children directly at the visit, what their drunkenness has cost and that it can almost happen that they have to work all the vacations to earn the money for one such fet," Dr. Pelikán added.
However, he believes that the sickness diseases do not take account of receivable procedures for the cost required by the parents for the healing of the drunk children.
Two training flights L-159 first in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighters L-159 from a total of five who exchanged the Czech defence Ministry against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M are fled into the Spanish city of Sevilla on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft producer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army.
In the abroad they were only to see in manoeuvres or flight shows.
It is about the flying two-seat version L-159T1 operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159.
These are still inserved in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the Omnipol company - has taken over last week.
When exposing the aircraft physically from Vodochye, Jan Pejšek, is not yet known to the Defense Ministry's speaker.
The L-159 fighting aircraft, once again, were separated from long-term airplanes, without further deposits and investments from the Ministry’s Ressort.
"The double-seat L-159T1 has been exchanged in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to come out without two-seat fighting aircraft, since the Ministry of Defence in May 2009, with Aero Vodochody, signed a 200-million contract on the transformation of four overflowed L-159 to two-seat versions.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second wants to take it until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has been obliged to carry the fighting aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"In the Treaty, stonep and clearly suggested that the company EADS is the operator of the aircraft L-159 and that it should serve for the training of pilots of the NATO countries.
"It is, therefore, the player's matter in what way he realises the matter," Pejšek applied.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in L-159.
Five L-159 wizard trade against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved by the Government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defence had not issued a tender procedure at that time, but EADS spoke directly.
At that time the Office of Defence argued that this Tausch will support the future export of L-159 to abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines from which she only used 24, the rest wanted to declare it.
On the other hand, the purchase of Casa may also have a legal impetus.
The European Commission accused the Czech Defence Ministry at the European Court of Justice, and the reason why it had to choose the aircraft on the basis of a whole European tendering, and not on behalf of a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last should land on the Kbely airport within fourteen days.
A longer shower than a ring finger means a lower risk of illnessing cancer
Men, whose finger is longer than the ring finger, are apparently suspended by a lower risk of raising prostatac cancer.
This is the surprised result of a study published on Wednesday by British Journal of Cancer.
This should be linked to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostat cancer and this in particular in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at Warwick University.
The finger could help to determine what men should attain a prostat cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, with her colleagues in Britain, she pursued more than 1500 patients with prostat cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the shower was the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
For these men the same likelihood of prostatakrebs, as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and shower fingers were equally long.
However, in men whose finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, with men up to sixty by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already in the prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of gender hormones that the child was suspended in the boar mother.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer shower.
Former research revealed that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostatakrebs.
Václav Pačes, leader of Czech genetics and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was flyingly known to him, yet he noted the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk until now.
Czechia in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like the largest part of Europe, Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and hiking roads, the most strawn snow, the winter ministers were many places on axle all night.
The D5 car is locked between kilometers 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is some accidents of trucks and cars because of the road, and the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.

A few cars are also located in the street grab.
There are also problems at kilometers of 185 the D1 motorway towards Prague.
There are also two trucks collapsed here.
The drivers should go right behind Brno at 190 kilometers or go over Brno and rise at kilometers 182 in the town of Kývalka.
There are kilometers of stairs.
A accident has also happened on the D11, and that is the same at the departure to Prague.
A multiple centimeter thick snow deck is located in Prague itself, and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolones, for example, form themselves in the district of Prosek, including the road Štěrboholská is completely hidden.
The safest means of transport is at least the metro.

Most streets in southern walls are only feasible with increased caution.
In order to make Vyškov three sideways completely inadequate, in the area of Brno, snow confusions and in the surroundings of Blansko are forced to use snowfresses on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets fully locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratics - Milešovice.
Here you will also need to use snowfreshs for the snow.
When they are rearable, you can't estimate it until now.
In the Hodonín region, care is indicated in the white carpathy area.
On the roads that can be scattered only with inert scatter, one up to five centimeter thick snow deck has led ČTK.
In Czechia, from two to ten centimets of novels, most in northernbohmen - ranks up to 18 centimetres.
In the Malesian-Slesian region, up to 15 centimetres fell new.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops cutting.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American forces have first used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known only under their code name XM-25.
The generous hopes that this new automatic weapon influences the conflict with the Taliban and shifts the power relationship with its favours.
The new weapon is something like a super-genaue canone.
Their projectiles are driven to the goal by laser with a treasury of just a few meters.
The special dishes of calibre 25 mm, which have been developed for this gun and contain high explosive fluid vapour, functions practically as small granates.
The spices can be programmed so that they can explode not only on the target but on any point of their ballistic airway.
This means that you can use it against an enemy that is hidden behind a obstacle - a wall or in the sculpture grave.
It is usually not protected from the above, so it can easily avoid fighting the murderal steel splitter lines from the top.
Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, is the new warrant the first infantry weapon that makes use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The Soldat is basically taking place: he fishes the goal and sends a laser radius that determines the distance, so he wins a precise point of visualization, after which he corrects the increase angle, then he only needs to print down.
"We'll say you've measured 543 m."
"If you are pressing, the gun is charged and shooting it to the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
Reduced 400 jobs
The company Fujitsu relocates his office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will relocate their work from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu relocates its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry specialized on computer and maintenance on Wednesday, 400 women and men will relocate their work next year from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on the Lyoner Street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A speaker of Fujitsu explained that more than 100 jobs of the Group should be placed in the medium term, which have been distributed to the region.
The offer of rent was extremely attractive, and also the large-scale offices in the Astro Park of the working method of employees were better countered.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only tenants.
The competent director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The newest turn of an important company within the region found joy in the winners and disappointment among the losers yesterday.
The Frankfurt Economic Declarator Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" was won.
That's a "great type of location".
Fujitsu passed to the city, the attendance is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Oberbürgermeister Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city had been informed early by the management guide about the intention.
"We, of course, offered our help to the company," said Corwisi.
However, friendly contacts could not have changed any of the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader place.
Finally, economic reasons would have been the result.
Now it is about preventing a long retirement in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building shows itself collaborative."
The house used by Fujitsu at the Stadthausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine vertical" were among the other buildings at the Marienbader Platz ten years ago, among the most controversial construction projects of the Kurstadt.
As a shared project of the city and a private project developer between railway station and Rathaus, a new citytree was created, both due to the massive construction of the areas used before in parking as well as the height of buildings for criticism.
In 2001, the Appendix Advisory and Rating Company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel transport systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu at that time also related to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group, together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu heimated in Tokyo refers to its third largest IT supplier in the world.
He provides companies for example computer and servers and also provides necessary service.
The area of Rhine-Main is one of the largest in Germany, but many more employees are Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, which is intended to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
In the Astro Park office building, 7000 square meters were rented.
In the twentie-year-old complex - the name plays on its stern-shaped basic crisis -, amongst other things, the Central Association of Electronics and Electronics has its seat.
Amazon locks server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is growing in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banished the enthusiasm platform from its servers.
Perhaps there might be political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks-Gründer Assange is supposed to stop in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks platform is more and more in charge.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and now search for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Loverman, in other countries and companies, called on the Boykott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks-Gründer Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's lists, is supposed to stop after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks of Amazon servers endured."
"Free speech in the Free Land", the enthusiasts shared by the short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banished the Wikileaks documents from his servers.
The Internet activists had withdrawn from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to manage high access numbers to the documents when publishing the secret diplomatic depicts.
On Twitter, Wikileaks said to the step: "Priva - our dollars are now being issued to deal with people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with speaking freedom, "they will stop selling books".
Amazon stopped the use of his server by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Loverman's employees were investigating research, the TV sender CNN reported on the Office of Lovermans.
The chairman of the Senat Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a Boykott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
As a result, Lieberman called on the platform to reject the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, indifferent and unreasonable action puts our national security into play and dangers around the globe life," said a communication from the partyless senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks to distribute stolen material in his efforts."
Wikileaks-Gründer Assange, who is searched for rape suspects by the authorities in Sweden, is on Interpol's challenge list.
After a report by the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian in Britain holds up the exact location of Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London, there have been threatening.
"There was even calling for a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange was right for his security, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks greener will therefore continue to keep hidden.
Hrafnsson evidently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had asked that the person responsible for the Wikileaks discoveries should be accused and executed for verrats.
In Canada, a consultant of the Head of State, Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - in the television, Assange should be "made" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, there was a stroke exchange.
The American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "fascinated and absurd" that Assange had asked the return from Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recently known spionage demands to diplomats.
"I'm not really sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The U.S. government now sets the protection of its databases comprehensively on the test stand.
As a special officer, the Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House shared.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessive structural reforms" necessary after opening the messages by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the way the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that they would be in danger by the Wikileaks publication for the security of dissidents and activests.
"We have done everything to get in touch with them," said foreign speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it should be necessary."
The Ice University
At the Gelato University at Bologna, ice conditors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest rise and visitors from all over the world.
Where's the whole ice coming?
From the Gelatire and the Gelataio.
The Gelatier, on German something oldly the ice conditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian edicist art.
The Gelataio brings the ice creme with a spectacle, stretches it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice does not come by the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice university has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so that the ice creme from its machines is justified throughout the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest rise and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several special courses around chocolate ice and practices in the home-owned ice parts.
Some dream in the midlife crisis of a new career, others just wait for the smooth ice of their vague sehn juices.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a company consultant and wants to be in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream to open an iron part in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian house woman Julia comes because her children love Italian ice creams.
Maestro-Later Luciano Ferrari first explains the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice creme.
Evident is not only good taste but also the severity and good consistency.
Luciano also does not forget in his training the sandy caves of the national and in all southern overbuilding: "Italian Gelato is just the best - and then there is a lot of romantics."
The first step to produce seems quite simple.
Luciano gets the basic ingredients of milk, sand, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixture device that heats everything to 85 degrees and then cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a hook on the machine and comes out a pasteurized white base creme, base for all milk ice varieties.
Soon, the docent is embraced with questions: Can you only make iron creme with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimental desire run free?
Luciano warns about being led to the irre from the time spirit.
Anyone who speaks of ice creme "natural ingredients" may still use stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guarbone meal.
Of course, you can also make ice without stabilizer, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise it sacks together, and the customer eats on loud ice corns.
Various variations at the ground mass are allowed.
Spanning it will be with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano is different from the ingredients that are bought in the fruit department or in the sweetnesses of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn your dozens of aromatized additions."
"Do you should just experiment."
Either with fruits with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white ground mass that will be with eggs for yellow cream and with cacaopulver based on all chocolate conduct.
Now the course participants in the ice machines are allowed.
Luciano allows four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnus ice - with or without eggs in the ground mass, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also undergo the fruit ice varieties.
More aromatics, more fruit pürees - tasteful this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnus ice doesn't really beat more nuts if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice produces the working group that uses more fruits, less water and less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the taste of a Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Eishing is an accounting task: If Pfirsich püree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extraportion of sugar is required for citroneneis.
Luciano produces a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (Winzer measures the oechsle in the grapemost).
Fortunately, tables facilitate the computerry.
To make ice does not require as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device for the automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a device that simultaneously hits the finished ice separation and is cooled at minor temperatures.
All of the automation to despite small pans are not left.
The Brazilian Gustavo clothes himself and his course colleagues from above to bottom with fruit püree when the superdimensional stab mixer exhibits him.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a question of time until this happens."
Controls in the wheel
The European Food Authority of Efsa has been undermined by the experimenting industry.
The expert group Testbiotech now forms this object as an independent institution for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech-Chef Christoph then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for gentechnically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert were also contracted by the Lobbyist Association Ilsi for years.
It is paid by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the Efsa regulations for genetic plants and is therefore criticized in a clear conflict of interest, then.
The Efsa regulations are inappropriate with the Ilsi position papers in order to tackle the industry's handwriting to be monitored by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It's already the second time that testbiotech's concerns an interest collection.
A high-level Efsa manager was at the latest without editions or transition time to the Swiss Agricultural Group of Syngenta – and thus has changed the pages.
The Central German Rundfunk (MDR) has also revealed short-term personal connections between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which made the Environmental Association as well as EU Parliament.
However, the Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All the serious data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high-quality, are back in an opinion.
Of the experts who work for Efsa, you do not ask them to have no contacts with the industry.
But they should open it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This itself describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby task.
In this matter independent experts, such as then, criticise that geneticly modified plants are currently authorized without any feeding tests in animals and not tested the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences.
"We want to know what makes, for example, geneticly modified maize on the farm," then says.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins but not the entire genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you are not looking for the risks, how should you find them?", then asks complaining.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck looks like.
Since 1994, the scientist has been researching in the genetic technology and is currently at the Zurich Technical University.
The industry is now trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area as well as in the United States.
Therefore, there are hardly researchers that were not covered by groups.
In general, critical studies would not be published for companies.
"The industry controls security research," claims Hilbeck.
The Train of the Stones
Uli Gsell also has what is worried about 400 kg.
On Monday evening he was forming Stuttgart's railway station, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It cut.
The history is known: In September the Baggers were pressed and started to cancel a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart World was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the militant deepening of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing was in trumbles.
Cerbs in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft grey stone, burned between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in eastern painters, 43 years old.
He assured some of the bricks.
"These stones are reliquien."
"You must not go away."
He weakens: "A cheap and poor stone, easy and comprehensive."
When he looked up, the cigarette qualm was smoking.
What he's going to do with the bricks, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The track of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest at Tübingen to a former munition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone-line.
The 44-year-old acts with old stones.
He bought all those who fought at the bankruptcy in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would knock into chotters or disappear in the depony," he says in his office, a wooden basket that was once a watchboat.
He was intimidated and threatened when in September the newspapers stated that he bought the rest of the north wing by the abbreviated entrepreneur.
But he talked to the S-21 encounters, dayly.
And he explained to them that he couldn't have anything for the shooting.
And if it happened, then it would be the most beneficial if the stones were reused.
Approximately 200 S-21 entrepreneurs took one of the in cut 80 pounds of heavy quadral, piece price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a thinking, some may also be hoped to give him back in a rebuilding process.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck charges.
About half still stores in the forest, the rest is long sold.
Garden owner, Landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
They had come from everywhere and had been drained, which could bear bagroom and followers.
The Stuttgartian stones of the attack have long changed to "Muerle" or to restrict herbs.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
"Don't be the political component."
He rises in his ground car, making a tour through his 20 hectares of great empire.
Jura studied and canceled, later biology, then he became interested in computers and finally became stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40000 tonnes of stones.
From all over Germany he carries his treasures together.
He says he's the largest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's burning.
In the snow there are artificially renowned sandstones.
"They belonged to the Dresdner Marienbrücke," he recalls.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he weakens.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the way through the forest.
He shows a hop: red sandstone, earlier part of Karlsruher Railway station.
And continue.
"High Travertin."
==References====External links====External links==
Overall in the snow and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Presidium, Roman Granit from the Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
Which work, which effort, which welfare.
If Rongen remembers how the stones were crocheted earlier by hand and moved with simple bottle trains and oxen cars, it will be very ambiguous.
"It would be a scandal if you would shame something like that."
He hasn't become empire, he hasn't been rich.
But today 14 people are busy by the stone dealer, and also in the woods of stone, a sculptor, a smell, a glass blast, and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the rest valuer.
At that time he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
High-Potential Language Camp
There's a rule of army on the buffet.
16 students urged gambling, tomato appetite and sweetness.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are supposed to learn with VW developers about the car of the future - and all along with Volkswagens.
In the contest of the clever heads, many companies are now going to the close camp and, like VW, set on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: The tested graduates to recruit as early as possible in the hearing halls before they will come to the labour market and be surrounded by others.
And because the universities do not give up records about the performance of their students, the exceptional talents are trying to pick and bind to practice projects.
On the second day of the workshop on the TU Braunschweig, the car companies are about the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ballwriter, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful virgin talents of training programs and students' jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students are in contact with industry and collecting experiences."
"WW can meet students at the same time, look closer to interesting candidates and consider who will be in question as employees."
Such cooperations, so Selle, are not unusual.
It's new that the students' students are being buried openly.
"Sounds the focus was rather on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even worse.
In many industries, businesses are no longer able to choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
They must be priced and, in particular, balanced by highly qualified workers.
Especially graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation position.
According to the German engineers' association VDI, more than 400,000 engineers stayed in October.
And the so-called engineering liquels will grow even more, according to VDI forecasts.
For the economic testing and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt.
He organizes upcoming recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern snitzeljagd, where the participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company through the USA in the next year.
In addition, the participants can view and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to decide in two rounds of selection in the front.
Only the Crème de la Crème of the many candidates flee into the United States.
When hikeing and steaking around the high potential at the universities, the guards according to Dykta are growing.
"We want to retreat from the mass with the race."
"Only a simple sailing tower was too little."
For talents Dykta seems to be the bill.
"We have contact with all the participants of a similar action last year."
"One stands just before her conclusion and wants to apply with us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct buhlen at the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises also go to the pirsch for professional measurements.
"We are trying to reach graduates on specialist measurements."
"Etwa at the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, staff manager at Solar Technology Manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonn's company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problems of the pregnancy.
Currently, 35 jobs are issued on the company website.
"It's very difficult to occupy professional positions."
"That costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University in Freiberg.
"Professors give indications that we can work or write his diplomats."
Teure advertising operations are not indicated in solar specialists.
To do this, the company is trying to acquire other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"That can often not offer a large group," says staff manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job searching.
Flexible working hours, child care or good upgrading options are further crucial factors.
In a study of the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld occupied the 55th place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and look at the framework conditions for employees.
Personal leader Stübe is hoping from the placement also Plus points to the job seekers.
"I think that applicants look especially for external reviews about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build up a good reputation as employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to more authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make himself attractive as a employer leads about its own employees," he says.
In the industry yeargon, the internal employee Branding, i.e. employeemark training within its own proof.
"Affected employees are the best ambassadors."
If you handle his people well and identify them with the company, they would cast their employers from alone with friends and friends.
"That's like a game with bands," warfareler says.
Obama stops new oil drillings
Before the coast of the United States of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drills in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has adopted the government in Washington and thus definitively repealed their former plans.
New drillings are also predicted before the Atlantic coast.
This was participating in Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosion of the drill platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April is the trigger for the strict prohibition that should apply at least for the next five years.
Before the unfortunateness that eleven workers cost the life and led to the largest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama has signaled pressure on opposition and industry to allow new drillings to be allowed in the east part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the USA on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who have the responsibility for the devastating oil pest in the Gulf are not concluded until today.
In the centre of criticism, British energy group BP, which is faced with billion requirements.
A Amama's investigation Commission is intended to present its results in December.
In October, Minister of Interior Ken Salazar had repealed the drill stop after explosion.
As a result, several oil companies had put applications for new drilling projects at the same time.
With enhanced controls and more strict security provisions, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, who had been launched in accordance with numerous corruption proposals, will be reformed fundamentally.
In parallel, Obama announced to close lucrative tax fluctuators for the oil and gas groups.
The industry is now publicly warning that the volume of funding in the Gulf would fall significantly lower than before.
"The government's plans are the largest brakes for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant company BDO - still before the drill ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also accuses the insecurity in the industry: "No one knows what is going to change with the regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be raised up to further growth.
Ogoniland is abbreviated
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it rifts as at the tank station: billion litres of raw oil have destroyed the nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live by thief steel, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine apobari meant it good.
"Don't stop you," the ecoactiveist rests the journalists: "You will still get enough oil slaughter before the lenses today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to clear up to the breast in the water-folding boys with the surrounding snails: In the rainbow-colored water glaze, the scene is almost beautiful.
That sweating brown oil sweats under the surface is not to see.
Earlier she collected garnels here, Esther Badom tells the Ufer of the Bodo-Jetty flow.
In the meantime, the draaping waters are perfectly dead.
Five years ago, from a breast-feeded pipeline, the amounts of raw oil are poured into the huge moisture area.
Fisher from the nearby town of Bodo now need to rod six hours to get into fishery waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Nigerdeltas, is one of the world’s most displeasant regions.
The whole extent of devastating becomes augenable on the journey through the river runs.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat elevates brown brown brews, who put his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrowing trees rums like black lacritics from the ground, sadly let palms hang their wool.
Bird weakerms, such as they are common in moisture areas, can be searched for forgiveness: As soon as the outdoor boarder swears, it is widened in the like a tank station that smells former paradise spenstic peace.
"What happens here is environmental war leadership," says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in constant health risk."
War comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of Ogoni has been a battlefield that has been surrounded for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorators from Europe, organized in the 80s with the later exempted writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to set its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is refusing the return to Ogoniland: While from the entire Delta region the three-fold size of Switzerland with over 5,000 drill sources and 7000 kilometers of pipelines are pumped every day over two million fass of black gold, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, too instabil is the company's location.
All a few hundred meters rage stirling sites such as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" are much too tenderly called the heads of the drill holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most corrods into the mark.
Once again, such a drill head breaks out of each other, says Akpobari, then a constant electricity of raw oil runs into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have fled into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years ago: the amount of oil for the year, as they were used at the "Exxon Valdez" supertanker's "Exxon Valdez" in the sea before Alaska - one of the largest environmental catastrophes in human history.
Those who are responsible for the continuing eco-GAU will be struggling.
During the shell group of Sabotage and organized oil diet is responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protective drill pots and leak pipelines as a major cause.
Shell recorded significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than otherwise in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner warned the Group 2008: only the rate of defects on the directions was "a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like a far away, oil-sensitive workshop under the free sky, the mangroven shapes appear: they are splitter necked and shattered to the neck.
Among one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, are partly randomly scattered on the grounds, a fire flashs: an illegal small refinery.
In the fass the raw oil is heated over the fire for several hours, Michael, the head of the group explains.
First of all, petrol is thring through the pipes into the captivity pot, later the end of the direction of Kerosin and finally Diesel.
Thus, Michael and four employees produce up to four cases of Diesel à 300 litres: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black African.
Nigeria only has a single refinery.
With almost 40 Euro-cent per litre low diesel price, the illegal cookers can still offer: for their raw material will be unusual.
It comes from "Bunkerern" who attack the pipeline network cross through Ogoniland: this way, according to experts throughout Nigerdelta, will lose at least 16 million litres of raw oil every day.
However, only a lossing small part of the provisoricly-speed raw materials is illegal: the share of lion fills organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-level militarys, in tank ships and deteriorates him on the world market.
The debate whether the environmental catastrophe is rather blamed by the population or the lax production mode, the activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
"When the oil companies were not seen as intrusions and had not destroyed the habit of fishermen so thoroughly, it would not be sabotages, thief steel and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, the relationship of Ogoni was mainly destroyed to Shell, however, that only one deduction of the group was questioned: "Misschien are other nationalities such as the Chinese rather than better."
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"High time you disappear," says the muscular oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil seeds are covered by the special unit of forces, they do not threaten them in arrest, but probably a painful smell money.
Also, the most important soldiers from the state order want to benefit from the raw material like all Nigerians.
"This damn witness brought our country to the dog in every respect," says Akpobari.
Explore mediators dangerous construction errors in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a large security problem.
In the investigation of a notified machine, mediators have discovered a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophic automotive loss".
The Qantas airline wants to claim the engine manufacturers.
The passengers of the notified Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November seemed to have been much more luck than before: The Australian air safety authority has found a major security problem in the engineering of some A380 machines – and now warns for a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In an oil slaughter connection, he could produce fatigue rates and lecks, it was said in an ATSB’s opinion published on this Thursday.
This could have led to a catastrophic automotive accident.
Founded by Rolls-Royce engines in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Below is the Qantas Airbus, which had to be found in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now launched legal steps against the British Turbin producer.
It included a complaint based on an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which enables them to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said that his airline would require damage incurred for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire of the engine, parts had been solved and the trading surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause for damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be exchanged worldwide.
The Australian mediators announced to carry out further safety tests to the superjumbos, which are equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spouse Martin Dolan.
The security problem has been considered sufficiently important to inform all the concerned.
After the need landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept her A380 fleet weekly on the ground.
Singapore Airlines had some three of his 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
At an A380, Lufthansa changed the engine as a precautionary measure.
The double-stage flyer is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snow triggers transport chaos
Germany entirely in white: Overnight almost snow has fallen throughout the country.
On many streets chaos, trains and flights are falling out.
Auto accidents killed at least three people.
The winter fought Germany: At ice temperatures, nearly the entire Republic of the night is cut to Thursday - which leads many places to transport chaos.
In the north and in the east, some 15 centimeter thick snow covers.
Several motorways and many roads are strongly limited to traffic.
On the A7 at Flensburg, winter service was permanent, but it was not finished with the constantly newly upcoming snow.
In addition, heavily bones fought over the East Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Sea Seafare and Hydrography (BSH) expects on the East Sea Coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning to storm floods with waters of 1.2 meters above the normal stand.
In Saxony, the snow losses led to significant problems on the carways and federal roads.
According to the Uncontainable Meteomedia, the Sächsian Switzerland was therefore a warning level of violett - the highest level at all.
Partly, there fell 30 centimeter new snow, fresh and strong winds for wool.
There were several trucks and cars in the night.
In Sachsen-Anhalt, the police authorities also reported large disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to stock traffic and stout.
In Thüringen, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to German railway, Sachsen-Anhalt, Thüringen and the north of Bayern, there are significant disorders.
Snow on the sleeves, crashed trees on the rails or destroyed pipelines and softs are the main problems.
In Saxony, remote transport from Leipzig to Nürnberg had to be set up.
In the Thuring Saalfeld, a ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by fire arms and rescues with wool covers, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds fought over the streets.
On large German airports, snow winds lead to numerous air losses.
According to a speaker of the airline centre in Munich, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been deleted.
The winter service is in the durability.
Although only a few scattered passengers on the airport, they still were almost 400 fields beds ready for them.
On many streets there were accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver killed the life of a train on a train passing in Eastholstein.
The lodge leader was easily damaged.
Nearby Nürnberg, it came to a similar accident due to snow-coated streets: there was also a truck recorded on a tramway passing because the vehicle stayed.
The driver killed life.
In the train, four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nürnberg was thus locked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overlapping her car with Aschaffenburg on smooth streets.
A good news, however, the meteorologists have: Although the snow will still be locker and poultry and therefore already whirl up with light floors.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is homeed by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - order up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its two-way towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its true signs: According to a newspaper report, the money house buyer is looking for the two office towers at its head office of Frankfurt.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property.
The German Bank has just made its company seat beautiful: the two-swing towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; now the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now, the financial group seems to want to recover the costs for renovation - and seeks a buyer for the two homes, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes to a speaker.
The speaker did not call reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check if it is more useful to possess or sell real estate and then rent," he said.
Thus, the largest credit institution of Germany has already resigned its company seat for a short period of time.
The Bank took over the double towers in the mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home-owned funds and then renovated increasingly.
Energetic transformation increased the data according to some 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Branch experts appreciate the value of the now renamed to "Greentowers" doors of the newspaper according to about 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are renewed to a Fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, being still open, said the speaker.
Thousands Trauring to Dead Cumpel
More than 100,000 people have thought in New Zealand of the lost mountains who were explained to death after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies were still unable to be secured because the safety situation in the casualty is further precarious.
Some two weeks ago, the Pike River Mine came to a strong explosion near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between 17 and 62 years of age were destroyed under days.
A sin was dropped into the casual yacht but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of poisonous gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could fall down.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no survival for the clubs anymore.
The bodies could not be secured until now.
Now members and friends reminded of the dead with a memorial celebration.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered on the New South Island at radiant sunshine in Greymouth.
Two minutes long they're silent.
29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the pillars were set up in honor of the shaved mountains.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboarders, found their place here.
Before the government buildings of the country, the flags wounded half.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "out of the depths of the earth," said the New Zealand Minister John Key said to the participants of the Memorial celebration.
"But they never came home."
He couldn't conclude with the death of his son, as long as he did not see its body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was destroyed in the pit.
In addition to the President-in-Office of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial celebration.
At the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also destroyed.
Sales workers began to remove a fire in the inside of the coal mining work on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were persuaded, it will begin to cool down the gloomy temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Go to hell, warrior!
Does plates fit for art chocolate?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn will re-establish his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising" old Genre limits.
What audience may the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Wikinger warrior with only one eye (Mad's Mikkels) freed from his painers and surrounds his opponents with almost superhuman forces - sounds ideal for young male viewers on the search for bloody action, just because our hero likes to serve rabiet killing methods and his enemies already breaks the demons out of the living body if he has bad laune.
On the other hand, Einauge says, as he is actually called, the whole film over no word, and the other figures are at least one or two sentences or a few painful deaths.
Otherwise, he is sweared and swallowed in the magnificent hill landscape of Scotland, offering the Viking World for about a thousand years ago the Culisse.
Ideal rather for adult cineasts with interest in existrialism and very quiet camera travels.
Beautiful if a movie has several target groups, only damage if they're exclusion each other.
Since his wild and styled drug dealer-trilogy "Pusher" is considered to be a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses to make his works accessible to the arthouse with something more Humor, or something less brutity.
Most art-kino-friends are supposed to be disturbed from the round of splendid brain mass and the geometries.
At the latest, the action fans die longly when inaugurated for freely interpretable reasons with a forced Christian missionaries are set up through ships to Jerusalem and put an eternity in flute and nebula before the team evidently arrives in America and continues to swear there.
No wonder so that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has been published only on DVD.
This is especially a sadness because of the pretensive images, but also because behind the pretensive to bloody facade, there is a very exciting piece of cinema that has deserved some attention.
In this movie it is not about dialogues or a stringent act, it's all atmosphere, a film-worded fiebert space.
And from that there's no escape for the listener.
Refn gives him hardly a moment of relaxation and snatchs him with his iceny pictures and the dark comfort-like sound track very slowly to the throat, but especially with the infinite hate that counts against him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blond boy, who is faithful to the side, preserves something like innocent, all others are driven by anger.
The most of the unfaithful hero, whose motifs never are explained, but who will become for enemies and temporarily bonds to the warfare from the hell, perhaps the Ambassador of the Devil itself.
It means perfume, but maybe only for those who have never been corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a puzzled film that you can hate and admire, for anxiety, excitement, and stunning.
A experience.
Mystery Earthwork
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to take its position - it still allows controls.
By midnight of 5 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighting aircraft attack a mysterious, whirl-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrat; the next larger city, 30 km away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name is displayed in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor that Syria is supposed to have built in the quadral with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that goes off from the current.
According to a lettering of the US Foreign Secret Service CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor would also be well suitable under the name of the nearby locality of el-Kibar.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifty is hardly suited.
The CIA presented a video presentation with uncharge satellite images.
Per computer animation she blew in where the reactor's components should have been before the destruction, which was a smaller copy of the Nordkorean model from the Yongbyon Atomic Center.
She also presented photos that show the building from the vicinity or even the interior.
The reactor was just before the operation, said it, but had not yet been cut off with burning stations.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, there is little more known than then, and the puzzles were larger in time.
The former U.S. president George W. Bush recently revealed in his memorial that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-kibar, but hardly pointed out that there was an active nuclear weapon program in the country.
Some secret ministers in Europe are rather careful and speak only of a "birth reactor", even if they think the CIA presentation for "plausibel".
They lack hard evidence, as well as IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar, who IAEA has "genual material to ask questions".
Although the Syrians made an odd side of the supposed "unused military building", the grounds were carefully planning.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team found under the former head inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar tracks of Uran, which had been produced by people.
Furthermore, the IAEA was given directly after the attack by a Member State of satellite images of commercial suppliers from time to time, which may be more explicit than those presented by the CIA.
However, these records are not to be received on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - bought it exclusively.
The IAEA is therefore unable to verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always endeavoured to never operate a secret nuclear program or have built a reactor.
The Uran tribes from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
But IAEA, after analysing the particles, returned as unlikely.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss - as did the satellite images.
It also rejects the control hours a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the trumpets of the broken building.
And Israel also swears iron.
"We will never comment this," confirmed the official position at the time of the attacking Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
Thus, since June 2008, the case's investigation has been inevitable and "develops increasingly to a serious credibility problem for the Authority," as a high Western diploma at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna, is a serious infringement of the nuclear weapon barrier contract in the room over which the IAEA is waiting.
As a key to progress in enlargement, IAEA appears to see three further facilities "in functional connection" with the Mutual reactor - and, differently, exist.
The inspectors have not yet opened what plants are, nor what function they have or what they are suspected.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are deducted from nearby cities at the IAEA International as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Issis) has identified these places and found a building complex on satellite images with Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be in or directly next to a military base - with this reasoning, Syria of the IAEA rejects access to the three places.
In Vienna it says that the Syrians feared a fishing expedit - that the IAEA was sent by the United States to pick out military plants.
Because the nuclear-activities had become aware of the facilities by tiping the US secret services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photographs, that material was transported and transported between the three places and the quader at the Euphrat.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there are no "notice of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium extension or rebuilding; processes needed for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with Uran, which is not enough.
But where the Uran should have come and where later the Plutonium for the bomb should be separated, there are, at all, plenary mutations to these central questions.
Unclearly, too, whether trumpets that could mountain the valuable traces on which three places were stored.
As if the hundreds of trucks were lost from the ground, nobody wants to have information about where the shot has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni located on the other side of the Euphrat, which has examined Syria in 1998 as a stock for radioactive waste, is considered as unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently contacted her in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine with the reactor.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria took up earthworks in the three suspected places and removed large containers after the IAEA had access.
This can be random but has hardly contributed to the suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - only the effort of how great the interest of the inspectors is.
In fact, Damascus also abusived this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna have been emphasized a year ago that the reactor was indeed destroyed, so it has no high urgency, about U.S. bomber Glyn Davies brings special inspections into the game for a few months, one of the hardest means that the Vienna Atomic Authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA-Chef Yukiya Amano, who should suggest these inspections, has already spoken of "a option I am open in the future", but he still slows down.
There is a high risk in this way: For one part, there is a majority in the IAEA Governor Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than they are provoked to an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diploma gives in mind, "What is, if it can't find anything at the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started with the work on her unnamed regime, there is trouble.
The book wrote herself, a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Many more you don't know about it, but you're already enough for disturbance.
During the Yugoslav War in Yugoslavia, the women, a Muslim, loved themselves in her Serbian rape.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some rotation days planned in Sarajevo were moved short-term to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is turned down in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female war victims wrote about UNHCR refugee aid to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has reported a Bosnian newspaper now - Jolie is self ambassador of the UN refugee work.
She is not diplomatic - she has already offered the women a meeting in Hungary for weeks, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not been available, and Jolies attitudes against victims are enough to betray her about the rotation book.
Their organization recommended the UN refugee work to release Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
After some Hin and Her, the Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her book, has granted a rotation permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie didn't come.
The young author himself betrayed that she did not pursue political intentions with her film, worked with much effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, wanted to show the terrible consequences of the war and give all the sides involved a voice.
However, it remains vague during the content.
This is how a second synopsis is classified to the film in the network, which then quite differently sounds: the lovers knew in it already before the outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are moved into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What is significantly different from the variant "made massacre victims are in torture knecht".
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, Jolie, is "unfair and based on missing information".
Now you can only provide the hackers of Hollywood's peace: by making the turnbook, as many as before, illegally in the net.
Nothing like away here.
This night, it's gonna be running right around for the irns.
No trace of fraud.
For this, the home team dominates his guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.

Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this scarce drinking game and the back-keeping computer that does not really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old attempts to amaze themselves from the boring question of what the future will bring.
On his plan it is not a play-pace in Las Vegas, he will lead application talks in New Zealand in January.
"I have a multi-feel feeling with it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I have no work there yet."
After all, his friend already waited for him in Auckland - "She had looked up, cheating her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiled.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanners had already searched for their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks in many families on the island.
100,000 Irons will probably leave the country next time, says experts of the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015 they even count to 2000,000 emigrates.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, there is a serious loss.
The prognoses are true, there is a wave of migration comparable to those under which Ireland suffered in the eighties.
After a decade of the upturn that brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse now makes itself broad.
The economic crisis is particularly uncertain about the young, well-educated ices for which it has so far been a mountain.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the tree years.
Everyone was used, money was overflowed.
In the meantime, however, three of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are readers of young people who complain: "All things goes down in Ireland."
"There should be a restraint against politicians and bankers - but who can go away, and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last thing, please, make the light out."
Jura-Studentin Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future, because the government only operates eyeswishing and the young people do not offer future prospects.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy for how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
They observe how their comiletones hang from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, if it is to have to go out in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to address the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a roundum service on work abroad.
"For professional beginners, the work abroad is a great opportunity to make the first steps on the career manager," says the manager.
On his website, photos show Surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: work abroad is not a galery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
As it feels like building somewhere else, Seán O'Donovan knows for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're just moving up a fashion house.
In January it continues to go to Hannover or Berlin, the next project.
His home, O'Donovan sees only rarely because he makes extra layers to pay the credit for his home home.
"The situation is already somewhat crazy," he says after long time he takes over the threshold of his house for the first time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm as good as never."
He's laughing something, and he's going through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept gardens in the parking of large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed credit.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Did he scare that it could go wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan overlays a while, eats hot tea and says, "I have no children I need to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from New."
The construction engineer does not like wear complaints that he is currently often hearing.
"Nobody has to hunger - our situation is not much as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Don't work a while abroad, that's the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we feel only as an Iren."
He laughs and then tells his father who went to England in the last big economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Let the future open and just look at how it runs with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London has he already been behind himself, and why should it not also be good for him and his friend in New Zealand?
But one thing is still there that disturbs him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it'll be like a livestock party.
"Don't stay too many emotions," he says and drinks a big sleek from his beer.
"Laughter, that sounds anxious."
"We rather call it a way, very locker, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Demographic Routine
Democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than the United States.
These results came to the Latinobarómetro survey which was carried out in 18 countries and exclusively published in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change in opinion in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's survey from September and October.
First of all, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries at the South American Pacific coast, democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown annually by about 6% since 2002, the number of democracy advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
In Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong breakdown last year, such a trend is to be seen.
However, only half of the surveys in Mexico and Brazil, the most populating countries in the region, are convinced democracy, which reduces the regional average (see chart 2).
Approximately 44% of the surveys explained that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
About 34% trusted the convention of their country and 45% of its government. Both values correspond to those of the last year but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermined the efforts to improve democracy.
This also lasted during the world economic crisis may be the fact that Latin America's countries have experienced only a short recession phase and have quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(Laut reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the rate of poverty in Latin America only increased low and has fallen by 32% in this year.)
But from country to country there are strong differences of vote (see Diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of the divorcing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects in a widespread Progress thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more felt and increased violence, this is less the case.
For the first time since the start of the survey, many surveys in Latin America see a greater problem in their country than in unemployment (see Diagram 5).
Approximately, they say that either themselves or a family member have been victims of crime last year, but compared to 38% in last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance reflects in the greater support of the private and market economy: approximately 71% of the demands over regionally indicated that the private economy is indispensable for development, in 2007 there were 56% (see Graph 6).
Approximately 58% explained that only the market economy can progress their country compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the entrepreneurs in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president Hugo Chávez stated many private companies.
According to 19% of the surveys (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% in last year).
On the other hand, the surveys in Mexico and most countries of Central America see the most influential country, taking over this role in Venezuela's Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A electoral lap
No one had expected that the elections would be perfect on 28 November in Haiti.
But the facts surpassed the fears of the vows who eiled the country for help.
Overfilled elections, multiple votes, votings in the rice stone, destroyed election places and embraces were only part of the problems.
Choice locations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, of whom many had become hazardless by earthquake in January, stroke around the search for a choice.
Some finally gave up.
A dozen Presidentship candidate, including some discreet leaders, demanded the withdrawal of the election results due to an alleged fraud.
In the whole country, some forced protests were made.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the choice "as quite good in many interests".
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, so serious may be, do not necessarily invalid the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is supposed to be committed to President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected stich choice is available for January.
There is hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the Rap musician Michel Martelly and the former first-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial improperity complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who is only small or no consent in the voters, explains the voting office to the winner of the choice, this could lead to problems.
Because of the Cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low choice was feared.
On the voting day many Haitians were prevented by lack of organization on voting fees.
Shortly before the election started, some 250,000 still were not distributed for the choice.
There's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in reconstruction of Haitis.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Home in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave of sympathy that drives its popularity rate to over 50%. This is the highest value since its election in 2007.
However, whether this helps to re-experience next year, it depends on whether the clearly sad Cristina Fernández is more compromised than her deathal husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led the economic policy following the choice of his wife, often established budgets which did not take full account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President-in-Office to issue extra revenue according to its own credits.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the convention last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart infarction on 27 October led to further ceresses.
Some regime critics from the rows of the reigning peroniists were behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one Parliamentarian struck another face and others viewed the government of the order), the convention did not have to vote for the 2011 budget.
"I won't discuss this," the President said.
The financial year 2010 also applies for the next year, which makes the President more opportunity to spend money after its own budget.
The economy is hot: it will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty control to its main goals and not the inflation reduction.
He refused to collaborate with the IMF, shift the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Volkszählung INDEC, which then beautiful official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a moderated way?
She called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong rise.
But inflation undermined the growth sub by a great devaluation in 2002.
Cristina Fernández may, for this reason, wants to re-establish Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government met an agreement with securities owners who had rejected the former reschuld of the country in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to encourage an agreement with the financial hosts from the Paris Club to blame about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, such as elsewhere,.
However, in the last month, Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" for the creation of a new national consumer price index. It seems that this would be the first step to clean the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of its term of office without support by her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the medium layer, most enough from the churchism.
When the Argentineans return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the sympathy that you have been brought will be abbreviated.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she takes up many political decisions of her husband still and quietly.
weak applause for China
Taiwan’s chooser slowly approaches a closer connection to the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother over the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million choosers, which are 70% of all voting privileges to choose in the five town-circum burgemeesters and city centres, this is appreciated as a broad assessment of the President of Ma Ying-jeou.
Due to the construction of railway-breaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol of relations with the continent. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Mom has the tests, but just tiny.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) sets three of the five mayor, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Rather, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP) was supported by a greater independence of Taiwan, nearly 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidency election, this would be a problem for Ma.
Since his choice two years ago, the vote share of his party has been about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city hall with the KMT.
During the election, there came to the conventions common in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with crawallmachers, flag-swing mass number trains and only sparrowly dressed dancers.
There was even the compulsory, mystery murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and Honor Chair Chief of the KMT held a speech on a KMT Candidate at the preliminary end of the election;
when a man shot him out of the crowd into the face. Line was wounded and a surrounding observer was killed.
Bizarwieser is not clear whether the protective line kills or wanted to contemplate a dispute with the candidate.
Depending on this, the attack according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the choice and left the DPP into a bad light, which made the KMT more voices.
Perhaps China was the largest winner of the campaign.
In particular, the relationships with the continent were not thematized.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans on social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their faxy independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, KMT does not like to put its relations with the Government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also avoided the anti-Chinese feelings too disturbed.
She responded to the new consciousness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma on the other hand wishes to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanes support China policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to retract Taiwan with economic incentives into the Community.
China immediately sent a retailer to Taipeh in order to prepare a summit meeting on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants a political integration, but the most important first.
It would prefer to wait until the presidency elections in 2012.
The DPP has now rediscovered.
Two years ago she was weakened: the former leader of the party Chen Shui-Bian was in prison because of corruption.
During his Presidency from 2000 to 2008 he entered vehement for absolute independence.
But under Tais Regentschaft, a new generation of male politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of the professionals and youths.
Tsai found great approval as President of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this is a preliminary discussion.
Tsai publicly explained that her party offered a "trustful alternative" to Mas for a faster approach to China.
Chen seems to be angry with this change.
He explained from his cell that the candidates of the DPP had done better to stand on Taiwan’s independence.
He even called on the Pragmatics Su to stop the Presidentship candidate.
Without chen's interference, the DPP is hard to choose its possible candidates.
KMT will have to undergo self-analyse.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT Candi data wanted to lead their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for its inevitableness appear to be unemployment and the ever more barrier between poor and rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will transform his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong event of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports a re-animation.
At the same time, most Taiwanans see economic cooperation with China as unavoidable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent Columnist, "it's not back."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly excellent in the Newcomer category of the year
If you act at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to enter the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize Award. Now, the 26-year-old jazz-Bassistin and singer were surrounded for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding is already a celebrated star since her album "Esperanza" in the Jazz scene in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules, after which an artist was released before the album, with which he was known in the broad public.
Your ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is surely a step forward. And with its suppressed voice and a good feeling for Pop, Funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success is coming next to Jazz in this category of nomination Spaldings in 2003.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This Favorite of the critics thus experienced a huge success.
The competitive Iyers include "Moody 4B" of the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a royal favorite from New Orleans and frequent guests in HBOs "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary Jazz, in which, otherwise, albums from Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are found.
The secret societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue was given attention in the category of large group. He thus responds to the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the defensive Dave Holland and his Octett, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53th Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five votes, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", an explicit orchestra work, with three votes.
Among the nominations with connections to South California, Arvo Pärt is the Estonian composer with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was ordered by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and set up in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo records.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Under the nominated classical albums, Bruckners Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concert Building Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" from Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, mountains were "Lulu of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wandererer" from Orchestra and Chor of Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales nominated.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Grafiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wandererer".
Pärt’s Symphony No. 4 was recorded and recorded on 4 January in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is cleared to the former oilmagnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with Orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the Mandolin artist Avi Avital, who launched the concert with the New Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and many North African sounds and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestra offer for a recording of the works Strawinskis with the Chicago Symphony orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, Pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the prisoner Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.

In the Classic Crossover category, sopranistin Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Moschee in Temecula gains consent from the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found after a five-hour public hearing the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Criticians warned the project to promote terrorism as well as transportation.
However, according to a statement by the Commission of Wednesday evening, the new religious centre meets the local provisions and will become an aesthetic view.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday tomorrow.
"As a Americans, I'm proud of it."
"It shows that justice exists."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides according to press enterprise were quite equally distributed.
The debate was continued on the web page of the newspaper.
"There are no America anymore," was a comment.
"It is another planet of the apes, and the statue of freedom lies dead in the sand."
"American is at the end."
In other parts of the country, planted Islamic centres have also led to protests, e.g. near Ground Zero, the terrain of terrorist attacks to New York City on 11 September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violencelessness.
His municipality with about 135 families has lived peacefully in the Riverside County for years, but they wished a larger and better location than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer for water filter facilities.
The new, about 2.300 m2 large mosque in the Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minarettes and become about 13m high.
It is supposed to be created on about 17.500 m2 large plot at Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still impose the project to the Council of City.
Arsen-resistant microbe may allow new life forms on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can live by arsen, opens new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is their view of a sign that life is possible without the elements that have been considered vitally.
"This organism has two options."
"He needs to wake either phosphorus or Arsen."
"This makes it quite special, although it is almost a kind of 'other' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of the Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report, who appears in the online issue of Science on Thursday.
So far six main elements were regarded as vitally - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the Calibernic Mono Lake continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus by Arsen.
"There are questioning what is still possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from the Arizona State University.
Discovering is an important step in searching for outerly life, since scientists need to recognize life and shapes.
The study covers microben found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details were published on discovery gave rise to far widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could act by discovery of outerly life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms can be launched in other planet systems with the help of other elements of biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements', which are absolutely vital, are not absolutely defined," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a Novum, because it shows that a element can be replaced in basic biochemical processes and structures," cockell added.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Astrobiological Institute of NASA, which led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
Since arsen and phosphorus are chemically the same, she assumed that microbs who are exposed to both may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsene is mainly based on the chemicals of phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so large that Arsen works differently from phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system where it quasi shamps everything," Anbar explains.
The researchers exhibited the GFAJ-1 bacterium of an increase in Arsen concentration. It fitted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can survive in Arsen, it shows that an arsen-based life form can naturally occur, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on which asses occur more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, doctrine for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by Arsen is not new, but there is not yet a working example.
Arsen appeared more often in the early Earth years, she says, so science assumed that early life forms used it.
"This is why life could have developed differently than in the early age of earth," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simons research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dog found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibits that were stolen before a Bellflower motel were found according to the statement of Los Angeles County Sheriff from Thursday.
The four exhibits - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van, where the animals were brought before a Bellflower motel 6 night, says the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well up," says Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not make any detailed information about the location of dogs to the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say anymore," Whitmore explains.
"We follow some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal home in Downey.
Representatives of the Sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trape, a three-year-old row, and Didi, a 10-month old dog, were injured according to the authorities' statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, the Rickard and Peek wanted to imagine this week on behalf of their Japanese owners on the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard who live in Redding were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, Trape should participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple of dog views.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their delivery car before their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer dwelf, a parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with their motel room.
The thickness of Akitas and Corgis stayed in the delivery car because it was cooler there.
They opened the window a column wide, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car at 6:00 a.m. as stolen on Tuesday.
Peek promised any who could give a hint to the corgis to finder wage. The animals were implanted to microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not whether a finder wage is paid.
The Lion again breaches after the judicial authorisation of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainties, MGM finally received green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New-Yorker Conkursor's targeted the "prepared" globe plan to detach the debts of $5 billion and the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and television shows.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. conferring law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will be present to the somewhat specified studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually enters into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million for financing the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which itself brings $75 million, the company, which is supposed to be financed until mid December.
The herstructurering of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company leader, who fought with interest payments of $300 million/years, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, the Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who was known by his activity with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve financial care MGMs and pay out more than 140 believers of the studio took longer than expected.
After monetary discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company to the purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few beetles, and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the believers.
In the spring of this year, everything began from before when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after monthly debates and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially exceeded the concurrence in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1,2 million, amounts to $9,5 million.
Cooper, who was paid for the management of the company monthly $375,000, will receive a "subject bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio produced only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come into the cinema in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which should be created under the Peter Jackson regime.
The investor Carl Icahn, who funded about 18% of the MGM-Darlehen, tried a fusion of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
But the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect Video Console. Both players can break a significant hole into your gift budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic juices or about 48 doses of Play Dog.
But you can clean your gift budget.
Recently, I visited the search for three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moor's law was in force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although less new toys appear with their own website, there is a broader offer on the best of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button cells-based toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteryes.
Here a few recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all the prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plumbing figures, as large as sea sweats that sing a note when pressing on their belly.
One time pressing corresponds to a note, by multiple pressing you can play a song.
Multiple Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in Harmony.
Attention: If you have started the press once, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of gender and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Prize $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo Live Technology developed last year, the animatron Puppe offers interchange games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the so-called Scharnierfüße with bicycle blocking, it controls the Moon-Walk.
Children testing the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents are complaining about the missing volume system.
If you are a child of the 80s, surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now it's again (Hasbro/Play School, $40, for children from 3), with a whole hop of questionnaires that can become a car trip to a lesson time, with a better exchanger with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you don't like to trust your child’s smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the most cheap and user-friendly solution, equipped with a qvaluey technology. However, the games included there are not as educational as those in the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which are equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first big revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher Prize ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for the games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photographs can also be viewed to it.
Lastly, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a wooden brick and have a own LED screen.
The game is about to put the blocks together with words before the time expires. It is great for an improvised book taber competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go in the toy shop alone, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online tea in the Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the Code Online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
It can be roll shoes or a puffle stofftier.
The latest microroboter, hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your tooth brush.
The report quickly moves to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an odd garden of chats.
And he's keeping some things out.

Police collections in China become more soft
As a officer of training progressed Tang Shenbin over a city place, his nervous subjects checked and gave commands with military authority and damped voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust wallpapers of urban order, feared and despised for their random race and their slope to violence - the viewers.
"Have stand!"
"Look out!"
"Tell them," he fled to them, "as beautiful girls are like!"
Four girls, hard to grow up teenage old, with white grains and identical olive green jacks and hoses stand stirred.
Four pair of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four ordential huts sat perfectly on the hair kept with blue-white striped sleeves.
"For me, they look on average," said Mr. Tang poorly.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polise the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new candidates must have a higher education.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of grey greens.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by lower stars: in 2009, 50 officials reported a non-justly established ambitors and starved the operator until they packed and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police stripes, and they have been selected specially because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are supposed to give the big police a soft, femininic aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad picture that the Chinese of these city commands have.
That's right, the critics.
In contrast to the police, these officials may enforce the urban laws only by means of penalty or other administrative punishments.
But the Chinese media show routinely another picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei tried to kill a viewer when they filmed with his phone as they were shaking a protest action against a garbage stop.
The last year, a school handbook of the Piking officials has been stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be crushed without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai water melon dealer suffered after a amount of hands with five official brain injuries.
A video game that can be downloaded from the Internet before violence shows officials in China when attacking street dealers.
"Chengguan is afraid of the government," said the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further conflicts with tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleaning".
Creationists are the current approach for significantly insufficient.
When the distrix in October searched for eight female recruits, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical delegation.
It's probably both.
According to Stellenanzeige, women from 18 to 22 were searched for with good figure and "harmonic facets".
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inch.
The employment ratio ends with a 26th year of life.
According to officials, women’s activity is more than 25 women's physical effort.
"The most important thing is her image," a unnamed distributor at the quasi government website Rednet.com.
"Of the candidates get the job, first depends on their outer appearance, such as size, weight, facets, etc.."
Then Temperament and "inner qualitys".
"Bibbean chengguan are like flowervasen," he said and added, "but they have other obligations".
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of City Management of the Distrikt, does not wish to comply with this description,
However, admitted that sizes in China are not inappropriate in job advertisements for both sexes.
The same applies to equal facets.
Whether that is equal to good appearance, it is encircled in China.
But people with disabilities or physical dispositions do not need to apply.
"We are unfortunately unable to use lambs or bucklights here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, patroled on the Baoguang square near a cluster, is 22, has apple bags and a well formed mouth.
It didn't feel as sexistically that the great value is placed on her appearance.
"Find me seeing this uniform sexy?" she asks with ironic view.
Her colleague with the crystals, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the city's image."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude as they had more ambitious career plans, as simply as a distributor by the gases to prevent them from making business.
Every morning, the strip with about twelve street dealers, who try to sell at foot or on the bike as many broths and tofu courts as possible before they are pursued.
"Here Wang, please leave here."
"We have said this to you so often!" explains Frl. Xu a dealer who fled on foot and had temporarily left his nudel kitchen on a bicycle car.
According to officials, activity is more monoton than stressing.
"It's almost the same day," explains Huang Jing, 20 studying in leisure distribution.
"All routine."
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to construct the goods of the traders, such as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male supervisors.
This is to protect them from public hosts, which are often suspended by officials in China.
In this year, a hundred of the inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, who learned that Chenguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policeman and Chenguan officers were injured during the nightfall, 14 government vehicles were cast or put in fire.
Xindu remained shaved from such suspicions.
But the rests are not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where female officials patrouled this morning, gathered over 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confisted a motorcycle which was repaired against the regulations on the bourgeois rather than in a workshop.
The owner cried Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials drew their way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, stayed back and turned his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men above 40 - play a purely supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Many time we go for a verbal time."
"Manual but also physically," says Mr. Li nüchtern.
"The majority of time, people begin with the fight."
State lawyer will not accuse Senator Ensign
Attorney of the Ministry of Justice, Senator John Ensign released the accusations that were raised against him after his affair with an former voting helper and his attempt to give her husband a lobby activity, the lawyers of the Senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most difficult jurisdiction against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the Scandal, the country-wide for headlines and his career, he was a defeat of the Presidentship candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was about the judgment after the one-year investigation "high excited".
However, the Senat Ethics Committee could have a disciplar penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were set up and that there was no further claims in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express himself on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many Ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. Your opinion was that there were sufficient evidence that Ensign has missed the praise ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were open in the New York Times for the first time in October 2009 gave rise to the encouragement that Ensign Munro Hampton, one of his voters, helped to make lucrative orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton’s wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked during a election campaign and signs as a treasure master.
Ensign took contact with some political friends to provide Hampton work. According to the documents and hearings, he took over for them after the setting of Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was allowed to take no lobby work for his former employer or the whole senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which were closely friendd before the affair, ended against the so-called ban on the spinal door lobbykration.
According to the published indices, "it seems to be a discouragement and the infringement of the rotating doors," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specialized for the defense of clients who are in the government's visor.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to make known the reasons for the decision in the ensign case, Mr Brand and other Ethicanwives said that the Ministry was very careful in taking political complaints after a number of deposits pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision in the past year, to make the complaint against the former senator Ted Steven due to the disadvantage of the prosecutor.
State lawyers "sind apparently terrible," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (a organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the United States' parliamentary and governmental circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various claims against Mr Ensign before court.
"This means, in principle, that high-level government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief representative of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a call for a state lawyer on Monday and another day on which he was informed that the Ministry would not raise complaints against his clients.
Mr Ensign's defendant had cooperated with the lawyers to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated on Wednesday's declaration, "have acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he presented to the lawyers.
"I am not sure to go to the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just as much said, we believe to have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal election Commission has decided to introduce the investigations for a separate complaint by the ethics group, after the payment of $96,000 by Mr Ensign's parents to Hamptons against the Federal Delegation Law.
The election Commission said that there has not been enough evidence that the money was something different than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who supported Senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyist work.
An e-mail from December 2008 states that after Mr Hampton passed on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's head of Stab, John Lopez, had a talk with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "popping."
Mr Ensign was also acquainted with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister for Transport to communicate a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton lobby work had stopped.
Last year, as the first time, information about these affairs drove to the public, Mr Ensign reassured his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been at fourth place in the order of the Republicans.
After he had no longer noticed many months, Mr Ensign told two weeks ago reporters that he wanted a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police research, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hopes that the Ethic Commission is very quickly following the example of the Ministry of Justice and set its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire call makes attention to Twitter
A half a dozen of them walked away into the craws in the courtroom.
In the minute branch, they sent their reports about grievous testimony about Twitter.
At the end, the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process of rape and bed chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday the carefully followed process of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused to have killed three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will be an official end when the judge's claim of the death judgment expressed by the jury falls.
However, Mr Hayes lawyers have already submitted requests to the court, to present the reasons for a appeal and to take account of the courts for years.
One of the most provoking reasons is that it has come through the intense reporting on the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "cirkusatmosphäre" and a so widespread, immediate transmitter of exciting details, so that the jury was inadequately influenced by public relaxation.
This objection could allow the appropriations courts to consider whether new technologies are required for new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced it during this process, I believe that it is really a danger when the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes head officer.
The presidential judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Board Court, reaffirmed the applications last week by decision, when he said that the new media would be "controlled careful" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
Since decades, court claims have been established that the reporting on famous cases has made doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States repealed the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an eastern eopathe from Cleveland, who should have killed his wife, and said in his decision that the new media had given a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom".
Some believe that the television series and the game film "On the Refuge" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court claims, which Mr Hayes Verurteilung considers a half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communications routes from the court hall that were still unpredictable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be disturbed about the influence of the new media in processes pursued by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, she will be in a random way.
Professor Donohue said that some apples could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter affair is only one of many who declare the lawyers of Mr Hayes to discuss years and thus get out of suspicion.
For example, the defendants claim that Mr Hayes had already been prejudiced when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them during the jurors selection of gray place photos.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their teeth, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, were met with abscheu.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge had falsely exchanged a jurisdictor who was a critic of the prosecutor and that he had incorrectly exercised pressure on the judgment when he had taken the ineligible decision to free the jury about the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments on the impact of detailed reporting on the process may draw the greatest interest.
In a judgement that they had submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated messages in Connecticut and had been discussed by candidates during the election campaign for the Governor and the American Senate.
They argued that the new media had continuously reconciled the flames of emotions over the case.
"One of this daily approach to mediapiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "was still in New Haven and perhaps not even countrywide."
Your focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were more intense than reports that are slower repaid to be a technically hostile view that armed the reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appointing courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes needed by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers strengthen this claim.
In its objection, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the verurteilung of Dr. Sheppard was repealed due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can housing link the separation?
After a campaign of smuggling and negativeness this week, little housing has been broken out in Washington.
Is it a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before returning to the fighting of the parties to the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the top of the convention did not take any break into the major questions which were considered during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions were taken.
After all the things you hear, it was not a political discussion between two different pages, nor a remark of their shared responsibility, but rather a empty episode of a party's score collection.
The public meeting of the President-in-Office Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that exist between the members.
It seems to be clear that a close interaction will create a mutual respect for a period of months that delegates the ideological air that continues to separate members.
It is hard enough to claim that there was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise will require, while one itself tries to consider the limits of public opinion and the patience of the electors after a new war leadership.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants was limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep than that one could expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has been prevailed over the past two years.
Whether taxes, donations, health or expectations are concerned, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the November election Washington voted at least for a short time mild.
"No question, the soundfall has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections resurrect party passions that are dying again.
And that's good like that."
In some questions, especially in which the "lame duck session" are present, Republicans and Democrats have little choice than a solution."
Bush's tax reductions end the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, unless it is temporarily or permanent.
A compromise in relation to the increased unemployment is also to be expected, although only because the Republicans cannot afford it to believe that the favourite tax reductions for the rich while refusing workless workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, optimism has increased that during the "Leaze Duck Session" you can ratify some and at the same time the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of Brooking's Insituition warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions of the lame duck session must not be forced to lead to a permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th convention is launched in January.
Rather, he says that a phase of non-compliance is likely, perhaps even inadequate.
"After doing things that have to be done, this short-term psychology will be transformed into confrontation," he said.
Who is also skeptical - and this creation is shared by many - leads the courtity to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of things that happen from today to 2012, as a prefight, or shadow box, for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new republic majority in the White House and with the teeparty choosers who were of their education.
As worries the Republican leaders may also be concerned that they are too poker, they know that they have to try to reduce their promises, reduce the government's expenditure and stop the health reform.
These participants will already be clear in the first reactions with regard to the recommendations of the Defizit Commission, which include a tax reform and a number of taxes, as well as the increase in pension and lowering of State expenditure.
The vice-president Alan Simpson and Erschine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in accordance with their own assessment, urged them to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan officially recommend and fight very much to get near to this number.
The largest resistance is found in the chosen representatives of the body, as financial issues, at least today, are little space or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in the convention.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party conflicts when the Republic of Obama is challenging on the state budget, taxes and health system, later followed by a phase of larger two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that despite the partyity of the current choice, the majority of the Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a bag as it happened in 1995, both parties must take care of the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
In fact, this may be a optimistic viewpoint.
Participation and Polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological clause between Obama and the Congress Republicans than his time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see as a pure example for a more widespread choice in 2012.
This is how many Americans welcome this week's housing.
But on both sides it will require much more effort to find a common minor in the questions that the two still separate from each other.
Transmitted US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control is located in the hands of the "Kleptokratie" and it gives part of the spending fees and the protective money it collects on the Kreml. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Police and State Security Service are pressing high protection money so that they can keep their expensive standard of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimated businesses but also from organized criminal bands.
Each layers of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has described as "Private of Authority" - takes its part from the money that the head turns up.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose name was edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the Mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that the meantime has been opened.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a well-known construction company, have rejected corruption forecasts for years, and he has won numerous blasphemy complaints against such accusations.
In September he explained a Russian television broadcaster when he was asked for a documentation that suspects that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredible large number of Russians believes that their society is corrupt. This has given surveys.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the Ambassador report, individuals are called, and it is unaware that this happens by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it as "suppressed" and concludes that the government acts rather than a Kleptocrat than a government," says the memorandum.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "cryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which is wordally "Dach" or protection), which extends to the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-fold structure within Moscow’s criminal world.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the Miliz stand on the second stage."
"Last follow the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors at the lower stage."
"This is an incompetent system where criminal groups close a lie in some areas because the city offers no help."
The report continues that the FSB covers money from the largest companies and arrests the police of small businesses.
A source, i.e., "clear that Moscow’s business holder understands that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime), since they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs is no longer as asked as before."
The memo notices that while the collection of money is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business very quickly closed before - because of the one or other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kreml with victims that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev needs to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert Commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia does not exist anymore."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of violence, he says corruption is inevitable.
Landwide, so estimated, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country ranks on place 154 of a new study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (countries are listed by "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt".
The demonstration of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened late in Moscow after the late evening, will certainly trigger infringements within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be accused for the errors of Moscow, it can also be an opportunity for the Kremlin to say that you can solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be a gradient and responded proudly to the enthusiasm that American diplomas called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is our interaction which is an important factor of inner policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this with such an arrogance, with such pressure and so unethical, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confrontate with the past
In a weakly lightened classroom with dirty and debrising walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School remembers the man who built him at the later Khmer Rouge Guide Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule as "the slaughter", the commander remains popular in this distant former Khmer Rouge-Upburg in the northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, which developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
However, this year, 12 years after the Capitulation of the Khmer Rouge against the government, long-year-old followers are invited in Anlong Veng.
In April a local forum of truth and reconciliation allowed victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June the government distributed a school book that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community tribunal of the UNO and Cambodjas first condemned a former member of Khmer Rouge, when it sentenced to 35 years of prison to the former head of the royal Tuol Sleng Folterkammer, Kaing Khek Iev.
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge Veterans Alnlong Vengs grew, scared their efforts for reconciliation and cleaning in the Cambodia society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodja, an independent organization that researchs the regime.
"For her life was glorious among the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1,7 million people were executed or died in diseases, revised or for hunger.
When the Vietnameses and the Pot-Ied Government crashed in 1979, the survival of the regime and his military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread until December 1998 when the last movement took place.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla War from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodja, Ta Mok moved to Anlong Veng the next generation.
But in the middle of the 1990s, when a peace agreement, supported by the UN in 1993, led to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer began to pass over to government, which led to the capitals of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not been released, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he waited for his process.
When their gönners had no longer protected them, most former Khmer mourning fighters fled into the ruining poverty of the rural Cambodia and many maintained the movement in nostalgic memories.
Even though some elitarian officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, untrained farmers.
"These people have only benefited very little from Capitulation," said Sok Leang from the centre of justice and reconciliation that keeps throughout Cambodja, also in Anlong Veng, public forums
"They are anchored in the Utopic Agricultural Ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fighted in the jungle for the time of Veng before he left down in 1998 to live as a poor rice farmer.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now, life is hard because we need to care for ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also awakened worries here.
In the beginning of the next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, to court.
The order of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those responsible for the Greueltats, but it is not said whether it will go beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to soften the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations focused on In Chem, 64 years, which was during the Khmer Rouge rule during the late 1970s, District Chief in Manteay Meanchey Province.
In 2007 she had told the missionary of the Documentation Centre of Cambodja that she led the construction of the Trapeang Thamm Damm, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening, the chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun had long shadow on the dark grass, the chaem refused to discuss their past at Khmer Rouge.
If the court invited her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no persecutions anymore, this would be war."
Premier Minister Hun Sen, who fled by the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would complain more suspect, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must grab a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Kambodja has to do to go forward, Chhang Youk said of the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means the pieces broken," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that as everything can understand."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the high school of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodja, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are mistrayal because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complex, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book, and the court gain after and after influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
On top of the Dangrek mountains, one of beaches leads overwhelmed and with plastic garbage to a rectangle of black beach covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a tyrehop after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile seller on the street edge, said she doesn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people are going here to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last tranquil place where she will deposit a bush mature bananas - in the hope that he brings her happiness.
Belarus is agreed not to collect further gunable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign on the world's protection of nuclear materials, the Belarusian Government announced on Wednesday that we are no longer collecting high-rich uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Gipple.
For years, the US government had tried to convince Belarus of collecting no longer high-speed uranium and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
However, Officials of the US government told the Washington Post that two secret agreements have been taken with Belarus over the last two months to remove 187 pounds of waving uran from a Belarusian research event.
This prepared the stage for the arrival on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official staff who remain anonymous because of the sensitiveness of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuklearem Security Supply of the 47 Nations" of April which had excluded Belarus.
And it was evidently good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit of 2012.
"I was really excited of the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear security summit (from 2012).
"This proves me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the Agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to ensure everything precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get out of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obamas Nuklearem Security Summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation will never give up their uranium.
"How keeps high-rich uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally gunable, and less enriched Uran," said Lukehenko at that time.
"This is our raw material... we won't make dirty bombs from it and we won't sell it."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all".
Belarus has yet approached the USA a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first approach to remove the Uran Belaruss in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly radiated, say Official.
It was invited to a special move that is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and dissorgation, say Official.
The second approach was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by a plane.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with a large part of the money flows into the Belarusian research with weakly rich uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was highly carefully coordinated and agreed to build trust," led to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, which works in global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for non-wide studies estimated that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of waffy urans this year and hundreds of pounds of high-rich uranium.
According to the Joint Agreement, Belarus wishes to resolve its camp until 2012.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been stressed for years, mainly because of Luke’s loss of human rights.
But the Wednesday state suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues welcomes the United States of America and Belarus that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection against the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners across Spanish territory to Habana, as results from a telegram of the U.S. A. Embassy in Madrid.
This reflects the documents submitted by Wikileaks and reflected on the daily newspaper "El País" (per cable). It is added that the former Deputy Governments María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government should be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft, which surpasses Spain, are monitored appropriately."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid for human rights was charged in a dozen countries including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega spoke.
The Deputy Government's Deputy Government admitted that the Council's report "Man Zapatero at the same time" and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"The la Vega underlined, Spain has no objections against secret service flights across Spanish state area."
"You just want to be informed," not to be "prepared surprised," reports Aguirre per cable.
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out that the Spanish government "does not want to give great attention to this issue, although the government has only little influences, as they are lying in the hands of the judges."
On the other hand, the lawyer Vicente González gave the message in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to declarify the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Defense Minister on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no burdeny or sensitive information," the Ambassador explained after a conversation with the lawyer.
However, the USA were more concerned about the "applicable coordination between the Spanish state lawyer and the German lawyers" than about the declarated information from the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to discretional handling between governments," accused Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, on which the Embassy of the United States and the Spanish Minister of Interior Alfredo Põ Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "the Spanish Judges were incrediblely strongly cared for their independence and doing what they think for appropriate," he gave his employees instructions to "follow rhetoric comments to leave the tension."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"Trotz of their general pro-American attitude teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the government of Zapateros could be interpreted as possible human rights infringements, or ignored, will be hit capital even if these enthusiasms could adversely affect the US government," he highlighted.
The kids' murderer stated that she has detried herself on the Internet via the "moodsal" of the motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in galician species"
Monthica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname that she leads from small, she holds contact with a cousin and at least one friend. Both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, you must know their love life, which reconstructs the daily newspaper of ABC on the basis of witnesses of their family members.
The 30-year-old galician woman took up a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial, in 1998.
She held a year.
Soon after she had dissolved her relationship, she became known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his former person never let him do a DNA analysis.
Soon she entered another relationship.
Alberto was a young man from Lousame, a neighboring congregation.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to deal with the labour market, the small stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and separated them.
In March 2008, she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very friendly and sad because I came to work."
"When I shared this, he found it good, but now, of course, he notices what it means to be alone with the boy for the whole day and not to be free, to do and to let what he wants."
Later she mentions a communication that she has just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get a address to which I can send you the boys."
She complains: "If it doesn't like him that I leave the boy with my mother, I get him off when I am back."
In May she speaks of the return to her village: "I'm driving this week there, but I'm just going to stay there until 19, because I have to imagine a work on 20 if I don't want to lose them."
She explains she's taking her firstborn when everything goes well.
"He will be with whom he needs to be, that means with me. Never in life will I let him again with someone other than with my mother," a doubtful intention when considering their bad relationship.
There is another mail in July.
When she wrote this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was suddenly murdered on 10th.
"On the other hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand."
"On the other hand, he's like a bit with me and the place, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"Then he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenditure for the child girl."
On 17th, reminders and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos to the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he finds me like this."
One further: "Your boy is fine. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in anime and manifolds, there are communications from her.
She even had a own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called "Muki, the prisoner".
"Terror a la gallega (heading)".
The last man who lived with her, a defeated hunter, explains to have conscience bushes because he feels guilty.
He can't find that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monthica was transferred yesterday by the centre of court prisoners to Menorca to the province prison of Palma.
The competent, Carlos Maceda, stated that she couldn't remember the course of the case, "and she did not have the intention of adding to the small damage."
Before, however, she had been able to relieve César in the bath and to put his bodies in a case.
Defense and state lawyership requested a psychiatric advice.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in the convention and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
The PP has already looked at Parliament's elections, or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party reaches in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes to the parliamentary elections of 2008, while this number was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this rise in trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's vote and the binding of the PP's electorality, the PP's analytics prognose that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 conventional orders, while also CiU has gained 10 (this now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 Members (from 25).
These calculations prove the fundamental significance of Catholics for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - at the moment it has three - while ICV could keep its Members or win them.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections in May 2011. The People's Party (PP) can also be the tongue on the scale in order to end the Socialist Vorherrship in four capital cities and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euro for 2011.
Both nationalists and the People's Party agree that PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists do not achieve a majority, nor will they lose their traditional bonds (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican Debakel, this party will not lose its representation in the Barcelona municipality Council, where it has to achieve 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its share of vote in the four capitals of the province and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's reversal, where they had ruled together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
And Lérida is located only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Ros, maintains good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or giant, the People's Party was able to grow significantly.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and strives to train lists in as many places as possible.
Al Qaida cared for thousands of travel passes
Apart from the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven police officers of the Barcelona Police Police Office and the Nigerians formed Thailand's Dschihadist cell, the different Al Qaida Groups, including the "motion for the liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the Attentates in Bombay, which called for 106 dead in 2008 - with passes.
The Spanish Minister of Interior shows a great importance for these studies, which is so far that he assured that the "Operation Campai" was the laptop Al Qaidas world's "deficiency" and "social action".
The researchers assume that in the two years of which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passages were sent to Thailand, where these were false and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was put together, so that their "campagnes" could surrender the limits of European and other Western countries.
The cell covered is not the only one of the Dschihadist networks active in Europe, and therefore other European police units have also been involved in research in the European Union in addition to the Thai research bodies. It is not exclusive that it will come to similar attacks in the EU during the next day, like those performed on Tuesday in Barcelona.
In Coordination with this operation (the Pakistanian Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftichar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested in Thailand), another was arrested in Thailand with the Pakistan Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai countries of Sirikanlaya Kijbumierung.
They had led from Bangkok from the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - some of these were made in 2009 - was particularly stained tourist passages in accordance with the terms of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the name of men between the ages of 25 and 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to show visas stamps.
In investigations, it is underlined that until now no connections could be demonstrated between the in Catalonia arrested and the attack in Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the in Spain stolen and then in Thailand false travel passages.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that several thousand dollars were sent in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones later used by the members of the "command", which made a end to the life of 106 persons.
The police took a comprehensive documentation.
PP calls for a meeting of the tax agreement by Mas
The President of the PPC, Aliciaž-Camacho, had the opportunity to present Artur Mas personally its conditions for supporting his official accession as the President of the Generalitat, which does not differ from the challenge which has already been put and can be combined with the priority of economic recovery and the submission of regional independence delegation as a financial compensation agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the highest point of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's Party voted with the security of Artur Mas, which gave her the 18 Members who had won it last Sunday - a number which is more than sufficient to feel indispensable. For the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party of CiU is prohibited that at least one of the opposition parties has been voting with his vote.
The future bonds, which the regionalists want to enter into the next parliamentary elections, depend on a possible unity with the PP.
As regards the PPC party presidents, it calls for the support of the Office to be "all discourses in relation to sovereignty and independence" as well as an agreement on financial compensation between State and Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque country - and which the Chief of CiU is even trying to submit a referendum.
Both political leaders agree that they want to clarify the built-up political device of the regional administration and create the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the application of the Mas office are addressed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already been with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will come together with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Careheim confirms that death is not due to "missive measures"
The owners of the Old Home in Olot do not conclude that their career killed over eleven older people
The responsibilities of the Old Careheim La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference in which they revealed the damage of the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurser who had killed at least 11 old people for whom he was responsible.
The Head of the Old Care Home, Joan Sala, came up with his lawyer Joan Cañada, before court, and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for deaths)," but "right and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only take a social loss because it had not detected the criminal acts of the nurse time but also pays a high amount of compensation that is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé stated that the first crime goes back on August 2009 and that he had been murdering since then.
The judge ordered the exercise of eight bodies - former patients of the Old Care Home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally studied the dead but the formalities were phonely developed due to their age and disease.
The Head of La Caritat agreed this point around and stated that "excessive measures could not have been the cause for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the dispute there are no indices for driving acts of another person than the accused."
The "Todensengel" baptized 11 murders and explained the first crime on 29 August 2009 and killed the second old lady for one and a half months later.
In this case he killed with an overdose insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of different restoration agents.
The head of La Caritat stated that the access of the staff to the medicines should only be difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the restant cocktail inserted the nurse at six of nine crimes in order to free patients from their suffering with the death.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will reveal whether Vila is lying and for his first victims actually chose a less cruel death or whether he burned them out by inside, by administering them Bleichlauge, as he had done it according to his consent with three women who he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, there is no faith in the nurse's statements, not even as regards the number of ranked murders that could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the reason that Vila had made very different statements before court and that it would make no sense to change his approach after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say that they made them available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
European Central Bank (EZB)
The investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of the ECB-president Trichet, who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our response capacity."
The euro-peripheric risk charges have risen dramatically and the shares of the European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility of deceasing the ECB and the euro has hardly attached to points of concern.
The events of yesterday are typical for a illiquid market, which, in the extent in which it brings together again, but due to the conclusion of shorter and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose its fear for a long time.
Today before a month, the European Central Bank called upon us to re-establish our liquidity measures, which will have to make the ECB a returner for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Federal Bank called for the plan to purchase State debts, as they were ineffective, as well as the withdrawal of all extraordinary liquidity measures, which should be maintained only a weekly unlimited access.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures "at least until March" to be extended and the quarterly awards with unlimited access to the quarterly end to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the program will continue to buy obligations and give a strong signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets will be recast from yesterday and if it is hardly persisted to resume our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as the ECB session in May, when the bank confirmed not to take into account the purchase of State debt papers and the markets broke down thereon, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said to have already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one year's state title was quite weak in Portugal.
The State Managing was only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points in the whole curve and reflected a change of perception of markets according to the words of Trichet.
The figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland's debt hole were published in Ireland.
The sum will be estimated at about 10 000 million short-term and possible further 15 000.
Although Ireland completely lost its credibility after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable and are helpful to reduce uncertainty.
However, on the next Tuesday, the government must receive Parliamentary consent to its new budget, as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has designed its discourse in terms of the summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, which is asked for political unity to show that we are playing the same participants together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethovens.
The Spanish President of the Council of Ministers presented yesterday the programme for measures to be adopted by the Council on Friday.
Rental reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as financial institutions, reduction of State deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and labour procurement measures.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explain why the Spanish stock exchange has added by 4.5 percent double as much as the rest of the European stocks.
Compared with February, the response of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was quickly and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year State bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we put a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our reschuldability.
For Spain, the application of a aid plan would be a self-sufficiency.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need, and the treasure has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are expensive and the access to the markets would be timeless.
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the Motto Caesar's wife: "Now is not only the One, but also the Schein."
Just courage, that's what we can do!
The Chair Chair of Eulen, at the request of his children, fights the Vega Sicilia Society Assembly at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the Eulen and El Enebro companies, does not flee.
David Álvarez, founder of the company court, will fight the company's meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on request of five of his seven children on 16. As he believes it "absolutely neglect". His children will try to receive a majority to control the company's administrative organs - holders of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare legal measures for a new jurisdiction chapel in their dispute for controlling part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not seem to be ready to comply with El Enebro's legal dispute in order to control the organs of El Enebro.
He was taken out of the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, appointed to administrative members at the shareholder's Assembly of 18 January of this year, which is already in the trade register.
The General Assembly of El Enebro, which was appointed by the Judge of the Court of Trade, point 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new Donnerschlag in the shot of the family Álvarez.
The appeal of the Judge to the Assembly is the only legal way to ensure the appointment of the Society's Assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "awaiting means of the applicant - his five children - in order to accept by legal spices, misuse of fraud and legal abuse, which are not justified congregation of 18 January," as official speaker explains.
This argument is the basis for the fighting of the congregation in the afterhand, in order to explain it as "absolutely notig".
The same protagonists, who are in disrespectful silence, were already struggling to invoke a congregation on a judicial basis in June.
David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital at El Enebro - property company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group calls for the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter on which the Judge has to decide in the hearing on the treatment of the accusation for which no date has yet been established.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull started the world of formula 1, its history is characterized in this read universe of surprises and successes.
In the beginning, no one gave attention to the new one, and despite its steep climbing passage during the last season, all on the win of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso during the endspurt last November.
Without the capabilities of the German pilot and World Championships Sebastian Vettel or the power strength of the engine of Renault, the "heimwaffe" which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into hands and thus created a winner team to become a legend.
In fact, there is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company in 2007 aimed at the use of author races.
This computer program called PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in factorys around the world, energyworks and high-precision instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process will be used before it is actually built to avoid such mistakes and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, the aircraft of Sukhoi and the most famous business vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of the Industrial Department of Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and in the tests can be delegated and performed.
Russwurm suggests that in 1992, ten technicians worked in the race halls, which were able to introduce at least three or four improvements in a season.
In Red Bull's team, 180 highly qualified young people are busy today. With powerful EDV plants they will conduct analysis and all possible changes in the race car.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all components of the Red Bull race car, with the exception of the engine for which only Renault explains.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to the reality thanks to advanced production plants and hightech autoclaves within less than 24 hours by the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars, which may spend a Formula 1 team for its law separation in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech Fabric for the development and production of his racing car in a 50 kilometers away from London.
It is two buildings where visits - especially journalists - are very limited.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
It includes 580 persons, including the two pilots, the World Championier Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest World Championshiper Sebastian Vetell.
According to the enormous technological resources that the Energy Drink Manufacturer puts on the services of its participation in the races, further protagonists whose support is indifferent and whose knowledge is equal to zero.
The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago, one could say that progress in F&E for car cars with 50 percent was contributing to win and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the value of the share has changed. The technology is 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey recognizes that fat and webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are "not predictable gladiators".
HP will open its own shops in two years with local drivers
Hewlett-Packard (HP) last night in Barcelona, his first exclusive shop in Collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a 20 business sales network with 80 to 100 square meters to open the multi in the next two years in Spain.
The company agrees with the already existing 16 sales areas in the multimarket business, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy president of HP España, Helena Herrero, called the transformed shop at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to establish 200 sales offices in Europe in 2010, of which 20 branches in Spain.
The first had been born in Bukarest (Rumänia) and Belgrad (Serbien) last week. Barcelona is the third business.
Mr.a did not want to betray the coming new openings, but did not decide that Madrid could be the next goal.
The Deputy Chair, who is also Head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy is always the same for loading opening. It supports a local driver with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American company group advises this and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products for attacks). In Europe all shops will look equal.
In addition, HP is responsible for training the store person.
Helena Mr.ero said that it is not a franchising system and suggested that with the exclusive sales office network, "the customer service and advice of small and small companies will be planned to optimise the packaging."
The Barcelona shop has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
An online service builds a connection to the technical central in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve 10 minutes of problems that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and small companies as well as private customers, because the large companies have already their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years to be a million clients 'clause'
The Managing Board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for banks, but firstly a new liquidity crisis and prophesie the end of the debt war.
However, he expects a breakdown of the interest margins that the banks try to compensate with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to enter one million private customers in three years - an unprecedented subject.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year lead plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking advantage of public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000 when the customers will lose the bank - that is the great challenge for which this bank stands, because it has now dedicated more attention to its business customers than to their private customers.
This year, it received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share in private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers make more than 10 per cent.
A further principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, speaks outerity, cost reduction, and the challenges that the bank faces will be presented together with annual final report.
Only a few banks are waging to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as all banks' plans have been communicated by the financial crisis worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will conclude its four-year guide plan Optimum, which was initially interpreted to three years, but due to the market situation it was extended by a financial year.
The customers who are going to leave the sparkasses are the main goal of the bank.
In the event of a breakfast organised by the APIE, Guardiola, 2011 would be a "swore" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain only gets out of the crisis slowly.
In addition, it would be "a difficult" in two or three years "to create work" - basic for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war will have to pay for passives, which are punished by interest margins, the risks that banks and parks have to pay for their emissions for the conservation of liquidity, as compensation for expensive profit margins are already deprived to the price for loans.
"The topics of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exercise pressure on credits."
"We didn't turn the hahn off, but the interest differences are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued the arrangement to its branch network on Thursday to limit the contract of long-term loans and to increase interest differences (see Cinco Días, 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that banks were currently pursuing the state of increasing the fees, but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's Guide Plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporative businesses.
In addition, he assures that in Spain "greater companies are necessary."
"In the next year, everything will change," he assured.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently increasing "and standard" and does not exclude some Spanish financial institutions in red figures.
It is of the opinion that the FROB could replace the money market with capital increases.
After he assured that Sabadell could survive a temporary closing of the markets, he disappoints the argument of some bankers who already prophesie a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing can be surrounded, but in contrast to the incidents in June, one could achieve short-term financing on repo businesses and thus capture the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of fusion of the sparkasses
The CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, recently rejected the possibility that a wave of fusion of the parkers could come and stressed the speed of which the industry was being restructured.
When the concentration process began by the Spanish Sparkasses, several sparks did not participate in the first phase. They kept the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Parking Association (CECA) assured José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers is completed. The involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather than adaptations."
"The largest part is finished. It may be that we have threeteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has supported all processes strongly."
At an breakfast organised by the association of the Managing Directors and Managers of Aragoniens (ADEA) Olavarrieta, Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "as soon as possible was completed and that we must be satisfied with the time-by-date course, which was not now defined in the framework of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The passage of 45 sparks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger that we have met the Basel Agreement," he highlighted.
Olavarrieta explained, "it would be a number of unsatisfactory opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed immortality and insanity," because "Banco de España encourages us to end timely before the end."
The CECA Director, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain had one of the most rigorose financing systems across the world and added that those who doubted this "without deeper knowledge" did.
The manager noted that in the current economic conjuncture, we must make "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and the sparkasses, which have carried through a "highly important" concentration process, which is "as soon as possible".
He also reminded that the Spanish banks had very good results in the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time the conditions for the entire European Union.
The voltages on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the other hand, José Luis>>eng<< Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting in tax reductions for small and small enterprises, the regulation of timework firms or the withdrawal of 426 euro support for unemployment which does not involve unemployment, until the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of the Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Government Shepherd, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as a responsible person who deprived the current crisis.
How are these operations to understand?
It should be presumed that the notable position is not a mistake of their public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
Germany is taking a basic new perspective on the design of our future that is collecting with the maintaining of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe, over three possible causes in Germany are being speculated from the crisis.
First: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south must leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the German Mark - although it is currently rather according to Science Fiction - is supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Thirdly, a redesign of the euro according to German proposals means more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries arising from the prescribed; the possibility of payment of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been recorded for some time, so there are no interpretations now.
First of all, in 2009, and both the IMF and the European Commission were creating incentives for deficits and the German government moved out a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the breakdown between what Germany considered necessary (streight tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of his European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country, as Merkel, outlined the decision to rescue Greece's painfulness.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion was absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
In the last October days, Merkel comes to the new with a clear position, and it calls for a reform of the European Union agreements to enable the salvation of a country and at the same time mandatory private loanors to carry part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European, since it driven forward the Ireland crisis and all of the following.
However, its proposal, although something was not adopted, has been adopted, and in the next few months we will participate in the reform of the European Union to enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not remember it too exceeded.
It says all that, even if there need to be inhabited measures, the old functioning of the euro will not be anymore since this date.
In 2013, the year of birth of a new currency area in which the counterfeiting countries will be severely punished, can be forced to explain unable to payment and, in this case, the private sector must take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth course, with high saving and investment rates, the use of consumption, the improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external sales.
The other alternative based on debts and constructions with huge holes in the payment balance as used by Spain in tree times will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we'd be bad to not understand it.
It is not just about going down the State deficit until 2013 to three percent.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to betray ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences go over into more tranquility.
And that we will use the possibilities that are being offered to us until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has so understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, to create the mortgage in the home, their way has prepared.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like it would change something.
The possibilities taken into account are that we should not exclude the euro area that we have to leave with a few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still say that it has warned us.
Sports and regulatory migration
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to deal with a sanction.
According to two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) set out in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League, there was a lot of ink forgotten about whether it was an importal act or not, and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As commonly known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (the team had already gained clearly) time and played several fouls, so that the shooter showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would introduce its group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction at the next Liga game against the Auxerre and thus enter without cards into the next game phase.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of UEFA punished the club trainer José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different money contributions.
The provocation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is no new practice, it is more often found in the world of soccer.
It is so widespread that it is part of the Ethos - the unwritten, but in this kind of sport -.
In part of the debate on the case presented, a team of the Football Club of Real Madrid (the team of its hymn Edelmut and Edelmut and Honor, and at other occasions his players had punished for similar incidents) played the main role, and the dramaticization by Mourinho, which added an epide more to his long history as a theatrical and provocing technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether it does not explicitly contradict the principles of sports, i.e. whether these acts represent a regular migration. In fact, this approach holds itself on the statutes of sports, but seems to be surpassed by its sense.
In this case, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical inverseness of the players, a aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not a aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the counter-treating players take an unjustified advantage from the counter-team.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand under false game or regulating, because the Umgehung of the rule was not secretly executed to avoid a sanction, but it should be as vulnerable as possible to punish it by the skudder.
The players waited and accepted the sanction gladly.
Another question is what kind of advantage the distributors moved from the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be highlighted that the Rivale was not brought into a more vulnerable situation, nor have been heated advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with less players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage appears that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, since the team could even be separated. In addition, the players with this approach receive a sanction and go over into the second card cycle, in which they are separated from a card with a card less than in the first cycle.
This does not make it so clear whether it really is a benefit.
Finally, such actions do not oppose the sports spirit, which also includes strategic decisions in order to benefit from the provisions.
In this case, the players did not want to deal with sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of rule change), they wanted to choose when they were subject to this.
They met a strategic decision without deviating or fleeing before her.
Although the border between invention and regulatory environment is fascinated, I believe it is a clear case of invention in this matter.
I have the impression that Polemics has been created by two factors: because it was two self-equivalents and because of the type of provocated rule transfer.
The damage added to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer at the customer receipt for group-weight dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar leaves this year a law of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are widened and they don't want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmaslotterie, there is also group dinner again in the pre-westnacht season, which runs to Barcelona's restaurant and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they solve a price-offensive in order to enter the client segment that is the great mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirms the questioned entrepreneurs and associations.
To make the accounting even more complicated, the calendar (silvester falls on one Friday) falls all orders into the 13th December week, with the result of a law of dinner reservations on two top days (the 16 and 17), and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times started, many companies have set up the group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to stop this tradition, many employees pay them out of their own bag.
As the conjuncture is always located, lowest prices are demanded, the chairman of Barcelona's restaurant amenities confirmed, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the roof association does not predict until now how holidays will look like this month.
"The people overlay it forty times before they reserve."
"You would like to go out, but they look strongly at the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will be doing well to "provide quality at good prices with good service," he adds, and calls us to remember saving customers in crisis periods, why prices are most demanded at 25 euros.
A survey in various centrally located restaurants reveals that the evening of December 17 leads the suppliers to the collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demands for this Friday were intended to spend less than 30 euros. The group has adapted its menus with total offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic location.
In another leading group, Andilana, who maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the uniqueness of the calendar has led to pre-reservation, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year prices with menus for every taste from 19,95 to 30 Euro," he explains.
With AN Grup, the El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, you do not lose optimism after the second quarter, the revenues are flew again and good, although concentrated on a few days’ views for Christmas business.
Sources of the company group show that the 18th day will also be overactive with friends who celebrate Christmas.
A Christmas menu was added to the six group menus for 30 Euros or more than price heat. It is the impression that customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than the previous year and wish more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you see green sprinkles, why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group foods are retired.
On the side of the Fecasarm Dachverband (with mergers such as the Barcelona Kneipen, Restaurant and leisure association), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, is familiar to see the end of the tunnel and observes that the reservations are quite lively, although the clients are "at the maximum".
However, the fun of the celebration was not returned, no matter who pays.
The Pakistan nuclear programme is a major concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "sneller than any other country".
Wikileaks' enthusiasm confirms relations between Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondency between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department confirmed the enormous concerns of the Washington Pakistan Atomic Programme.
On the edge of the clearing and suitable details that provide documents on the content of the discussions and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomas in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between two countries is not reinforced in the matter of atomic security but, on the contrary, "criminate" and that the instabil Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a faster rhytmus than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistan Atomic Programme - that the weapons are not put together, but their individual parts are stored in order to scare their destruction during a possible attack - Washington prepared sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones,: "The nearness of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable distribution of nuclear material and the adverseness of nuclear material transport".
The large number of persons implicated in the nuclearsenale and the missile programs will be regarded not only by the United States but also by Russia as an extraordinary and reason to give care.
"Pakistan has to set a strictly believer staff to monitor nuclear plants; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to reflect people who work with nuclear or missile programs," said the expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with its North American officials.
Newly revealed documentation by Julian Assanges Internetportal is that cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan is complied with nuclear distribution in matters and the increased tempo in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, a news office that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", explains: "Happy there is no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia confirms that "the economic disaster of Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
The Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit to the chief head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify the responsible," that "Pakistan's army has to introduce his silent support to terrorist groups."
On hunting to Wikileaks Chef
Obama owes a high responsibility for antiterrorism campaign to prevent new enthusiasms.
Interpol gives a red warning for the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complex labyrinth, in which the situations are only difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol gave a "red warning" for Assange's discovery and persecution.
However, it is not a traditional arrest arrangement.
In addition, she is not new, she is from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the last enthusiasm of more than four million diplomatic documents from the U.S. but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian must put in Sweden.
Moreover, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assured the police, where and how they could contact Mr Assange."
At the request of Sweden, the international police authority, based in Lyon (France), announced the arrangement, but it was not announced by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after receiving the power.
The 188 interpol countries are assigned to identify assange and find out, "for the time to arrest and deliver it."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to statements of the organization, consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrangement - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England where Assange is likely to remain.
Assanges advoked lawyers who published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the issues of Swedish authorities per video conference.
They also remember that Assange requested the trip from Sweden and the lawyer who will compare the same approval with the lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security head of Stalin.
"This is like a hunting, not like a legal persecution," the letter is accused.
While the world seeks him - and his mother from Australia from the innocent guilt of her son - Assange holds himself in an unknown place, but not swearing.
On Monday he gave the head of the Time magazine by Skype from an uncertain place from an interview. In the conversation, he requested the withdrawal of the State Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats, the UNO has expelled and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, it should come back," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for withdrawal as "slow and absurd".
"I am not sure why we should put value on the opinion of a type with a website," he explained the sender CNN.
Obama himself has a high responsibility for the fight against antiterrorism, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new document declarations.
The attempt of the speaker of the Presided Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions proclaiming conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
The Congress deputy Peter King, who is led to the chairman of the National Security Committee of the Member States from January, has invited the State Department to examine the possibility of setting Wikileaks to the list of terrorist organizations, "to take up their funds and to follow any one who supports it or contributes to it."
Tom Flanagan, advisor of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, was still going on, and he had to call his statement that Assange had to be "moorded".
"Obama should turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible Presidentship candidate.
"Whoeeverever it was always made by information in the government, he is guilty of the betrayment and everything that is not execution, is too mild punishment," he explained to the sender Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for the carod Naheward peace in the ERC with a swallower
The Republican leader shall allow the party to vote secretly on its existence in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the full meeting principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe in order to move out the way out for the most twentieth time in the series of 11 Members after the loss of 11 and half of the voters.
The president of the party is aware that his detriment is not sufficient to the closest leader of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is weakened today as its mentor itself and not the same headbreak as other former streams.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics, which would ensure its position to the next local elections.
At the beginning, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional members of the ERC were able to speak secretly about his stay in the Office.
With electoral sticks, not with rehearsed hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss a penalty to the president, they could do so without fear of repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of splitting and the objection under his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel uncertain with half of voices plus one, and he added without a percentage value, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would also not be good.
The Carod Nahestehendes call for the President more than just the party to make his office available. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the highest organ of the conventions.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to forcing retreats, they will agree with the Board of State aid from now to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the development of the document on strategic reorientation that the direction will be presented to the Council on 18 June.
Their intention is to borrow for Puigcercós. In contrast, this promise is to prohibit the convention in the autumn 2011, which is already considered to be a fact.
The Party Chair of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" is harmful of stability and he aims for every time to allow the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that is signed by the Conseller Joseller Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideal, the holder of Innovació considered it to be founded "in exchange against different objectives".
He counted five, two of whom were in front of.
Firstly, the Board's herstructurering so that this is at least 90 percent of the party members, which means the involvement of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally suspend the full congregation principle as functional.
In this way, he defeats a reform of the statutes to allow the conventions with selected delegates.
From the end of the full meeting model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which was already fighting at the last two conventions for how to eat.
In fact, at the beneficiary Assembly of 2008, the party leadership was commissioned with the verification of the full congregation principle on a convention that should consider the reform of the statutes.
This date still stands out, as infogle was not ratifying the approach of this matter in recent years.
Now, without the critical sectors on the lake, the time could have come to re-establish this matter and end forever.

China maintains its goals to reduce greenhouse gases
The China representative stated on the COP16 that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon tracks and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gas until 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of this country on the COP16.
With its first public appearance on the 16th World Climate of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon tracks and to transform its industry.
He found that in the last four years his country invested $245 million to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, he explained that China would not change its objectives but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy is divided into four aspects of climate change: dialogue, construction of capacity, construction of institutions and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, we have made progress, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included the objectives for the reduction of gas emissions.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the state of Germany had worked together with those of the Central State and the Communities to achieve the objectives for saving energy, effective use of energy and reducing emissions.
It also led to some several years of plans have been taken or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those who received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy introduced over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and from private hands.

Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former panist party presidency has the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right is to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento's right was and that the former party president of the PAN has the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right to him.
In an interview that was held before the complainant Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state of state, he explained that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken locally.
"It is an independent decision of the order Commission in Sonora."
"Her Espino has the right to apply to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance with Presidential candidates never sat at the negotiation table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Ación Nacional was strengthened from the internal vote on the next 4th and 5th of December, when his follower is chosen.
"The Allianz in 2012 is a theme that was never on the negotiation table, at least not until now. It was a precautions for the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he performed.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back to 71 years of dialogue, so "it's not afraid of the internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and strengthen it us," he commented.

When he was asked about the criticism of PRI at the President Felipe Calderón for his discourse under his four-year government, César Nava called on the followers of the PRI to think about the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend, they should finally come out of the war," he confirmed.
He believes that the holder of the Federal Government expresses such as those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because there was no ban on the mouth and less a censorship in this country.
Obama works in Twitter for law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - Law, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," the President of the United States in the popular social network.
Today, President Barack Obama supported the countrywide mobility to support the Dream Act - Law on Legalisation Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - Law, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," twittered Obama.
Its short release contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document that calls for the public to enter into contact with its senators, as the vote of the law is immediately required.
"With your voice we wait, the time has come to listen to you," he stressed.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican Senators threatened to block all the voice for each law except the extension of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the government's financing.
Such blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the dissemination of nuclear weapons.
Regarding the blockade of the Republicans of the Law of Dream Act and other projects, the Presidential speaker Robert Gibbs said that, once the tax theme was solved, a timetable could be set up for the other projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"All of us agree that the tax affairs must be distracted before..."
"I believe that we can meet an agreement at any time and then we can plan the expiry of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senat, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday, "he would have to apply the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law, with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be agreed from the next Thursday in the Senate, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - Law or the Law of the American Traum would be legalized by about 800 000 young people who were immigrants in the United States when they were not sixteen years old, while the last five years have lived in this country and have been registered in a higher education institution or army.
But the defenders of the law need to adopt the initiative sixty votes, why they are assigned to the votes of a handful Republican. At the moment the organizations of the advocates of this project are organized intensely influenced on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, the senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would agree on it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defendant of the Dream Act must receive several republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to return to the initiative.
Among the most surrounded republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of the senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained not to support it at another opportunity.
A further Republican who had expressed himself for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his attitude.
Although the representative house has another version, the analytics agree that the Dream Act stands in the Senate before the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger with literature to the wound
The second round of 'The Lust on the Language' was a walk where the participants made strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected by me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los Placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish language literature and used the subtitles of her question (on another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "bring us in trouble," the architectian writer looked forward to the audience, who consisted mainly of young people who gathered together at the International Book fair in Guadalajara (FIL), to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, at Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and the shult afterwards characterized as a great story. Luisa tells the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what is a "wond" and from doctor to doctor who does not answer, but receives evidence for the guides of their story.
The infectologists convinced: "Geduld is not my strength, perhaps this is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the dreamatologists, who robbed her in the middle of the ashes, and who explains that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalytics declare the secret: "The wound is the really open, the symbol is the narbe."
The main figure of the story shifts easier and closes it "from the wound only learns that it is really open and not exist". But she is convinced that the desire of the language and its cases is mixing.
Valenzua, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a disappointing story that he called 'Lob of invention', and in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but is discovered.
With plays of magical realism, he tells of a famous magical magic who touched the clouds, brought back far-reached men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turmoil and reported by America, the great novel, who did not miss his own chronists from the beginning, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the overflow of the stories told by the overwhelming.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), spotted the presumptuous witnesses that had been found in the true stories, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with instructional power that even came out of harm."
However, he highlighted, "is it the suppressors and lies who imagine things the best", and there are realities and lies approaching each other, where you don't know any more, to which side the story belongs to where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this 'tradition Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was at the series, commented and praised the writer's diversity of interpretations to which the FIl had contributed to the round table 'The finger in the wound'.
The Cuban and Puertorikaner devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence, which holds its country - as whole Latin America - as a result of the fight against drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poesie, good songs contain a silenced, not pretensively planned commitment," she explained after she stressed that literature is communication and liability that builds up between the author and the readers as with a "chemical reaction".
The evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also contributed "this finger of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer", decided.
He noted that in a fast-life world, the intellectual habits and control of consciousness will run out of dogmatisms, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation is a little no and behind every illusion a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuclear: And Nutrines often meant to put the fingers into the wound and to worry those who feel much more well when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prepared ideas without nuances, and also to blame those who prefer to dedicate the world in black and white, he noticed and encouraged to discover the sense of writing.

In the Duell between Santo's Laguna and Monterrey, the final game also represents two different styles of their respective trainers, and their encounters are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three precipitations in final games, he has experienced ups and Abs in his career, but he had three times critical games, and has been well held so far, why this opportunity is of very special importance for him.
The Argentinean has played up with the medal to the second champion, he remained a step behind the winners and surprisingly wearing with the same team together.
The santistic street reached the first final game as a trainer at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the trains in hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, when he reached 'Clausura 2003', he lost the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to retreat a return, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went unequally after 210 minutes, but at the elephmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to put his title, but finally three of his players missed the 11 steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be pursued again by the unheart and freed by the wicked magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become Champion, I don't want to break statistics, that is for a club, for my affection I am giving, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important," commented the taxman when asked him about the lost final games.
The last final game is still strong in the memory, he assured to have learned much from it: "The only teaching we can learn from it is that until the shooter does not put the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players also, because the last time we were already prepared to separate with two elephmeters, and I believe that this is a teaching until the game is not finished, there is no occasion to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by elephmeter shooting, it does not worry him, because he trusted his players: "You never want to arrive at the elephmeter shooting, you would like to finish in the regular time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you must be prepared to be prepared in the previous tour, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the strong striving to keep the title in the hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope that it will not come to it."
It is in Romanso power to no longer be a second champion and to cost first the fame that brings the title with.
The USA change the rules for the conservation of a visa
Persons must introduce themselves before their conversation with the consulate at the service services for visa application; costs will be shortened in such a way.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying a visa are changed in the message of the United States and in the consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants have to propose themselves before they talk in the consulate with the service services for visa application (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The ASC staff records the biometric data of the applicant reviewed by the consulate before the discussion.
The new procedure has certain benefits for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separate payment of the deadline, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed.
The applicant shall only provide a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the opponent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including visa for time workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who want to extend their visa only must not have a conversation in the consulate, they must only imagine where they present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for conversation in the consulate remain less than before.
Those who apply the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay the service charge of $26.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found in the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the Fund for Foreign Life
The North American Space Agency invited a press conference to present a Fund tomorrow that will affect the search for living in the world.
The National Air and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States is announced tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of outeraard life.
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at 13.00 a.m. at a press conference in Washington’s seat of NASA by astrobiology experts. It is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
At the press conference, NASA assured that she would introduce "a surprising fund for the search for foreign life" which speculations for experts of other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist in hostile environments that we have thought to be inhabitable, human creatures. It has been cast up the hypothesis that they could transform into intelligent living, such as human beings, if their living conditions improved.
It is apparent to be a microbe that was found on the basis of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in a environment that was considered to be toxic to every thoughtful life, because the sea is very arsenic.
In any way, microbie uses the arsene as a survival resource. In taking into account this ability, the opportunities are increased that other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere could have similar lives.
If these organisms alternate the assumption, the astrobiologists have shown that "it really gives another form of life, a second form of life that differs from the known one."
The Space Agency will inform the actual scope of its Fund tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference.
At the conference, the Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest moon of Saturns) under question whether its chemical composition is similar to the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
The reform of the Organic Law on Congress is introduced the two-party system, it complains.
The 60th Legislatural period had begun and had already been installed by the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented itself as an independent one. The four question was: the entry of the 'two parties' system to the chamber.
Before the opening session in the 60th Legislatural period, Felipe Manzanarez van Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the Organ Law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, would introduce a 'two parties' system, since now it would be two people, the same number as parties controlling the convention.
These four Members, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the Coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the president of the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his property as a deputy president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties had introduced PRI and PAN with these reforms institutionally their political margin.
He suggested that they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI in the next days to change the scheme, and that they went out of that political will and if they did not, they would be injustified by both parties, which would put an end to opposition coalition.
"I am here (the opposition coalition), that's what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even take care of taking into account the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez von Convergencia explained that it would be similar to PRD, PT and Patrón and that a pluralist group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that after he was monopolitically, the convention should now be "duopolitical".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that in the convention a eternal two-party system should rule."
"For the beginning, this group begins with five Members and speaks with other colleagues so that they can become more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT led to a recording on PAN and PRI that the convention has now changed to a 'suite' for two.
"For that time it was just one party, now they split up to two."
Patrón Montalvo requested the Members to respect and grant them their place to negotiate.
"The five, which are currently considered in different groups, have decided to unite in order to take our place in the negotiating table because of the reform that has been carried out and prepared by the others, we are left outside and we are not agreeing with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán's city management pays another check to the entrepreneur of the company for electrical material.
A further check of something more than 200 000 peasant for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazueros was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical materials in the second half year is 1,200 000 peso.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued on a amount of 200.144.56 pean with the 9258447 number last 16 November with the purpose of "computing open accounts".
The treasure master Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money would go from the community to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at overstep prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total sum which you are still blamed and according to the number of checks that are still issued by Camacho Palazuros.
"It was bought nothing with her, it's just paying the debts, just as with the rest of the suppliers," he said in a interview.
The last checks "take" in the last quarter of the year "Resume": 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not been published in the Official Journal, how this is legally prescribed if a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid the application of other administrations to their services, the treasurer assured that its services were not taken into account again.
After the 25 July newspaper Noroeste published the test of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was known that the community had paid over 10 million pesoes with 42 schecks to Camacho Palazuros during the three-year term of the Mayor Jorge Abel Lópezć.
It also took place business with Jumapam, where they received checks in value of more than 3 million peso.
Tourist locations need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists because of the bad state of the Glorietaž Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the stirring of a foreign tourist in the infringement of the Glorieta Pedro Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in a poor state and throw a bad picture to the harbour city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada dealer association, reminded that there was a different opportunity to care for the goal of travel and the bad conditions that tourists find to change into new jobs or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and roads had been negative, as tourists were getting to the slander and see the uncertainty where they would turn to the nearest slides.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't make any thought about how much money you lose, because otherwise they would not carry out construction so slow and planned."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguartć said that the sturz of the tourist would have made attention to the missing prevention and the remaining maintenance of the city.
"The community must take up its responsibility and avoid that happens once again. How is it to do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in the afterhand," he explained.
"We are eager to have a clean city, because it is not only because it is a foreign area, it must be maintained, even we residents have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change their strategy in order to get the city in a good condition."
"There are other places that look unpleasant and inadequate," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito from Mazatlán."
"Todays we need more than only advertising to attract tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that cleanses its beaches and streets, and the tourist attractions constantly keep in shot," he added.
"These arrangements were not given enough attention and these kinds of incidents simply put what is clear for all: Maintenance is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed how important it was to save the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they wouldn't be properly used and made a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places to be brought together with the city to front. To make the city clean, orderly and attractive for tourism, should be priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that should be raised and cleaned at first to make it attractive for tourism and to introduce them to the inventory with which we are buying for this destination.
IP requests results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, suggested that Members should take the great responsibility to give a better synaloa, which faces many challenges.
The company of Mazatlán calls for a decent Parliament, free of agreements, to the parties and the government, because Sinaloa has been elaborated and is faced with great problems.
Last night, the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEMs, together with 40 people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to make a clean work, the society and the various social groups who are assigned to a responsible parliamentary work and that they do not repeat the same patterns of partyity and Paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE entrepreneur's CCE, suggested that the new Members should take the great responsibility to give a better synaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because they usually take agreements with which they represent their own interests, making them transformed into carnival synthesis of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to establishing the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure that they perform a trustworthy work and do all things for society and their groups, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who spoke their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguartć, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 people's representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, since today the economic situation is extremely complex.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and create infrastructure measures, which will promote job creation."
In the light of the foreign sector, he called for by the new Members to provide the necessary role in the state budget to promote the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the two-fourth means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings devises and investment into the country and is direct competition to the Agro industry."
Tourist projects must be allocated to funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been reassessed in previous legislature periods, must be established at the latest.
Searching for Holy King
Puppets, cars, bicycles and other toys desire the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
The next three royal day for parents it will be difficult to fulfil these wishes, because the budget is no more and less coincidence of twelve persons and a goat buck.
Yet, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothings that they are so exciting.
The family occupies a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth because the father has no fixed work.
"Many times are hard times called because my husband has no job. But we sell Mandarines and potatoes... I'll go to the street with the bears for sale," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a puppet or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wishes to be a barbie puppy.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'Monster car' for some time and for its eight months old brother Jesús proposes Cayetana clothing in size for one year.
" (José Alfredo) said me," I would like this monster," but I answered him, "Let us wait, boy," because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaías has the size 10, during the eight-year-old Miguel 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Hard King' by spending a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 Mutual Drug Dealer arrested
On Wednesday, a cannabis production and sales network has been discharged around the ten home tests in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and are faced with various claims.
The house tests played in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, on which places should have served mostly of the drug production.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of Haschisch, cash and equipment served by production have been confissed," said Louis-Philipe Ruel, spokesman of Quebec’s security policy.
In total, 11 men and three women were arrested, two of which are considered to be the main tractor of the drug ring.
The arrested persons should have appeared in Sherbrooke for hours after their arrestation.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, whose possessions are charged for sale purposes, the commission and the service of crimes.
These house tests had been carried out as a result of a long-term investigation that took place over a year.
"The information received from public hand has enabled us to carry out these arrests," justified M. Ruel.
Around the 70 police of the regional research unit of Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Service and the police authority Memphrémagog had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be pursued problemlessly.
The draft law of conservatives, which, according to the government, is intended to regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be forced for all prediction after the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I'm experiencing this chart."
"I hold with a party that has put you fessels on the feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the liberals, after the end of the weekly Caucus session before the collected Members.
The liberals claimed that the draft law allowing each person to be held up to a year by one person identified by an immigration of illegal immigrants, injured as proposed by the Canadian Law and Freedom Constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, likewise indicated that he could not support the draft law, as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are on the other hand and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism regarding the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has shown the critics who demanded that their party did not stand firmly enough to the secret immigrants.
"The Neo Democrats agree that measures are taken against the blind passengers, and we are just trying to implement this by means of another draft law, the C-35,", Chow applied.
We do not support the draft law of conservatives, therefore, because he seeks the debt in the refugees and keeps children captive for at least a year," said Chow.
The immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties to play with policy and ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians urge the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these crimes, which affect Canada and who treat the country like a footabtreter."
"You expect Canada to take hard measures," says Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any trustworthiness regarding its draft law that could have led the country to elections which the government had rejected.
However, a conservative has said to the QMI Agency that the government would take up a vote so that every opponent Member may immediately explain his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, standing unit to fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the training of a public research committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea was not triumph of yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Research on this subject last January.
The metropole has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has more than just one surprised.
It must be said that, despite the presence of Robert Dutils, this measure was not discussed at least on the meeting of the Quebec Police Committee on 29 October last year.
It was not also lacking that Stéphane Bergeon, critics and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in pointo public security as "out of the Hut saubered rabbit" as well as "on a tabled solution".
Minister Dutil once again turned to those who feared that the political power had too much influence on the inquiry, future unity.
"You will see the result when we are proclaimed," he pleased to confirm.
"We know this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest is persisting to prevent the education of this research committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means of being able to form an investigation committee is the withdrawal of Jean Charest", said Yves Boisvert, ethics and politics at ENA (State of the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this bag, he suggests Quebec to introduce a special mandate for financial auditing so that they can invest research on corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of testing," he decided.
He also believed that Quebec could enter the same power power as Commissioners, which would allow her to make people a statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Government Charest.
The Quebec will likewise requirement by Ottawa to change the penalty law in order to be better imposed on this type of crime.
This question comes from the head State lawyer of the Marteau Operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the legal statement in this type of criminal prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, State Minister for Public Security, on the other hand, his colleague of the Justice, Rob Nicholson, was currently communicated with certain novations relating to this dossier.
During the operation of Printemps, which took the groups of motorcycle police, 131 were arrested, although the criminal law was not novelled.
Ottawa has enforced the law against Gangstership.
Flows under strict monitoring
Several river runs remain under strict guard because of the high precipitation that has been poured in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, it came to an earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evakuated.
In the evening a further terrain in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region, has been established.
A street has been collapsed in it.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfall have poured down to several regions from 40 to 70 billion.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters of precipitation were expected in accordance with the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouai region were most affected.
There were up to 100 millimeters of rain showers down here.
Since these rainfalles are still to be added to the snow smelt that has already been gathered in certain suburbs, the surpassion of several water runs will be anxious.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service was launched warnings about the highwater alarm on the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the region of Lanaudiere.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the croftininian mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière will be the property of highwater monitoring and will continue to be observed.
In the region of Lanaudière, the heavily precipitation has moved some lakes into Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also to Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a back-up bridge was continued due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residences were to be eliminated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the surpassion of certain lakes caused several streets, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The safety service continues to be alarmed and monitors the situation at the same time, according to Annik Bouchard security counselor.
On Wednesday, the Quebec National Highwater Centre has released warnings of the strong rise in several rivers, especially by Maskinongé, Assosoption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Duponed to Partly
The Quebec Rundfunkmoderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial relapse from the Canadian Supervisory Board for Rundfunknormen (CCNR).
The CCNR believes that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team were entitled to their own opinion, but certain statements "inappropriate information on social care and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians and also included such an unhobeled speech that is not appropriate for the day's broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which includes the spread of the names of two persons who have committed suicides, is violated against the code of broadcast.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the period from 2008 to 2010.
The first available was submitted by a complaint of the "Front Communists of the person Helpées Social du Québec".
The organisation of activists had been accused that the amounts referred to in the mission were inappropriate.
However, the moderators should provide solid information as misleading.
As regards the subject of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had the opinion that suicide is a expression of figs.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message given was not considered that suicide is not considered as a solution to life crisiss.
"The majority of the Supervisory Council take into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" mission had been a sensitive topic in family-righteous and appropriate manner."
Hence, he was not occupied with any tadel toward his person.
The final point of dispute was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had provided a media-effective argument that a lot of reactions had resulted.
The CHOI mother had declared not to have sent for help in the case of Haiti, as one did not certainly know whether the needy would really receive the dispensers.
The Supervisory Council considers that these comments were not misuseal characters, but that their cumulative effect represents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already cut off my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
"My act has been young for half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Council calls for the dissemination of unhealthy expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has acted radio broadcasters "according to its obligations".
The consequences for the radio broadcaster, which, among other things, had to have communicated its decisions once during the main deadline within a period of three days, are small.
A king of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has launched a very special course.
The atlet, brilliant in "Sanda" (fullact Kung-Fu), in the Kickbox and in the Thai box, is now looking for new challenges to Tatami and to the box rings in the world.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with fighting sports like Kung-Fu and Kickboxen," said Zemmal, who has been attended in the metropolis since 2008 to develop under the professionals.
I personally seek the fight of all places, because for those who present the soil struggle, as the mixed fighters do not like him, wedge fights in North America are rar."
Recently, his sign as a security officer and the company UPS had given poor news to the company UPS, in which he came from the World Carate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I got the victory in the categories of the full contact Kickboxen and the Thai box," he explained.
"I prepare at the time on the world pocal in San Shou in China."
"These fighters were invited from every category that had been placed under the first four at the last World Championship."
"I picked up babe 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"2005 I became behind Vietnam."
"2007 I ended the tournament in China at the fifth place while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is noteworthy that I made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I will become the first time or the next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines based on China, in which fighters and footings are allowed as well as soils.
The two fights are usually playing on a platform, rarely in a box ring.
The most renowned box fighter who came out of this type of fighting sport is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of fighting art.
If Nacer Zemmal only retains a single event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the Super-Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," said the sympathic pound church.
"It's a little like the equivalent to the stadium of Lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand).
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first battle in the semifinal of his category (80kg) before he then lost in the final.
"He who violated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four contests per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the halffinals meet each other in the final of their category."
"The winners of each category then offer the front to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung-Fu."
450 million contracts without award
Hydro-Québec has granted 450 million dollars to contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1A-Sarcelle-Rupert in mutual agreements.
In the middle of this law of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of companies BPR, Dessau, Groups SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely the project leader, to a sum of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was founded in 2004 as a accompanied view of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector, its responsibility, this important hydroelectric project at a sum of $5 billion.
In the beginning of 2005, the "Énergie gérance" consortium provoked the lucrative contract without having given a public award.
For the Parti Québécois, the withdrawal to business consortia represents a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distorting competition and a price increase.
"This is a new way of a mapped game and dismantles the competition."
"This means that instead of being carded, games are conducted in a secret way now openly," said Sylvain Simard, Member of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
On the early morning Simard had thrown up the question before the National Assembly, for it seems hard to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded to it in the afternoon by vehement in Abrede that it had been a carded game on this contract.
"I remain faithful to my line," she betrayed by strengthening that the PQ was "unreasonable" and it "missed hardness."
She said it was "the least," that the PQ excuses.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary bond that allows two or more companies to bundle their experts with regard to a command to a tendering for a complex project.
The "Ostmain" project has a high complexity level in terms of its working measure.
The construction process is in progress and should be established until 2012.
However, the contract has been forgiven without a competition struggle; it had already been negotiated.
In addition, even in relatively simple projects, the consortium model is no longer an exception.
The last week newspaper "Le Devoir" notes that the model of the consortium is applied in the field of construction engineering and advice.
A short flight of the Quebec company register allows you to rename more than 200 consortiens, some of which seem to be persistent.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, which include CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Each link, and there are several dozens, leads to one and the same legal person, namely to Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Énergie gérance", Ministerin Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Many James is subject to a special labour force dynamics and that hydro-Québec has been subject to a particular manner of consideration for the 70s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Many James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has made the nose about the business that the contract has been approved after agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will be fastened."
"You have two ways: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell you, you will deal with a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that not the price is crucial, but the understanding of persons," confirmed Laporte.
This contract approved to the "Énergie gérance" consortium is part of a long list of contracts received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro Quebec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, the "Le Devoir" newspaper included more than 100 engineering and consultative contracts, which were approved between 2002 and March 2010, companies or their branches, including resource labors.
SNC-Lavalin had gained 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without accounting for their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They are totally 449 783 344 $, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" above 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain Simard said that the four companies who form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groups SM and Axor) were well known by the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had failed that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that they "financed" before they clarified that it was rather about their leaderships.
Barometer of Refusing Consumers - The "green" label is unreliable
Green but unusual skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little trust to the main actors of sustainable growth but also little to the marked brands or eco-markets to control its choice.
Shame, although it is bathed in a media-effective universe, where information for a more responsibly conscious consumer is just as a result: the barometer responsive consumption has a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that makes itself known as a brake of his commitment, as shown by the first reading that was held yesterday.
Although they have advanced the consumption of so-called socially tolerant products in 2010, the Quebecrs still seem to suspend those who try to sell them little credit.
Two third of the Quebec population admits, indeed, to give the company's environmental enthusiasm as little faith as the green company acquisition, the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke advises the measured instrument.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates, which appear to be fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves as environmentally conscious, is the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14,6% of the Quebec population.
The information relating to responsible consumers seems even important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently employed by nearly one third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptyness and doubtful nature of the information fought the iron of 46% of the consumers.
This is after the higher price of the products the second remse identified by the barometer.
In addition, one third of the Quebecs of the specified performance of the green products and services that you are trying to hand them is mistrayed.
According to another communication, over half of the consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their convictions.
According to Barometer, they also preferred to 61% purchases for merchants of their district and benefited from the purchase of food built in their region.
Green and responsible awareness - the index of the environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumption of Quebec loves to present itself as king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces in the environment by dealing with animal protection.
However, social and ecological awareness seems to stop his car, the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecrs have indicated to use public means of transport in 2010 or have preferred the transport centre to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The withdrawal and bicycle driving were also supported by 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavior survey, which is the specialization of the clinical premises.
State bonds for the adoption of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the Parallèle company to participate in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
Angus, as well as Parallèle’s company, who had hoped a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinemacomplexe eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent to retain its actual cineastic function.
Although the government has accepted influencing itself in this matter, however, to its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a bond in lower than the initial amount that could integrate a prerequisite solution, at least in view of the sources that are available from the governments.
A first action plan and a request for 12,8 million have already been rejected last spring from Quebec, the bitt test has been corrected summed down since the next time.
A proposal along with an action plan was already sent by the President of the Socété de développement of entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who led the Act eXcentris.
He had received her several days ago a last report.
However, the counter proposal of the cabinet was transmitted to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to answer to this until 31 December.
In any case, the premises of the governments seem to have been really moved to the side.
Let us remember that the Quebec Owner Community of the Kinos and Kinocomplex had refused against direct state investment to support the adoption of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Minister of Culture has no financial assistance for real estate projects that he did not even allow other cinemas.
However, several other market participants of the segment were complaining substantial, economic assistance.
During ten years, Kino Chief Daniel Langlois had presented the authorenkino in the spaces of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception of the state cassette.
The lack of cinemas that show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clinic at the Stange.
Société Angus as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, taxing a privately financed campaign, from which they hoped a sum of 700 000 dollars to curb the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009 only one canvas continue to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The future acquis is to reopen the three cinemas on February 27th next year with the presentation of the very successful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
But Christian Yaccarini has not called the newspaper "Le Devoir" and has ignored what he and his group are holding from the corrected proposals you have made them.
Secret of the complexly shooked Canada
The new, American diplomat leaders, which were spread by WikiLeaks, found the secret of what the United Nations considered under the minor value complex of the Canadians to the Americans, but they open the overlay feeling of the latter to Canada.
Hence, the American diplomats are surprising that the Canadian voters did not have the Canadian-American relations in the sense, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the conservative government to implement their 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which have been publicly distributed yesterday, provide even more pikant details than the mere substantial content to which you have to knabble.
A link dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal election campaign was in full, reports on which point the United Nations no longer participate in the revenue discussed by their political heads.
For the great amazing of David Wilkins, the American Ambassadors used in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various statements of this situation.
"An almost indigenous minority complex is likely to allow Canadian political leaders to talk about the internal disputes of everyday than the United States to put the black Peter (like 1988 in the campaign on free trade)" he describes.
The United Nations, so he concludes, is "the speaking goliath of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak about him".
The Ambassador understands this "suppressive silence" as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assessed, "the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party head to conduct such a essential relationship that the elector would have as a key factor in the sense of the original."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the communication sent by Terry Breese, business leaders in Ottawa, President Barack Obama to prepare for his first visit in Ottawa on 22 January 2009.
"Your journey will help to ensure the continuation of the government at the trust rate over the Federal Budget at the beginning of February, which will give Canada its first deficit after more than a decade, which is created in the height of 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese describes.
Neither had he noted that the government had had to meet the Parliament's meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from crashing from coalition and the so-called resumption of opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed belegment programme.
Another communication, dating from January 2008 and by the embassy of Wilkin's ambassador, is in line with Washington of the ever more negative image that the dramatic series are spreading through CBC by the United States.
The Ambassador is worried about missions such as border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle plays to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also disciplines for the purpose of winning by the cIA's muscle process.
Another communication reports on how Hillary Clinten had asked Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meetings whether Europe was willing to take up certain prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question yes, but on the basis of a individual "fals in case" decision.
On the end of the meeting, he described "has the Secretary of State handed out a paper in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin."
"The State Secretary has agreed to re-establish the document".
Finally, we still note that the cows are heated with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely standing consultant, had explained about CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "imposed".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States here.
Worldwide Plan for Renewal of Lighting
The UN has proposed a plan in Cancun yesterday to renewal the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW) which is close to one third of the additional reductions to be realized in order to stabilise the global climate until 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of concrete large projects to implement the UN in Cancun to compensate the absence of forced reduction obligations in the industrial countries.
Following the last plan, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKW due to lighting on the earth if the white-glying pears, which are still present to a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better by light-dioden (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global Fuhrpark.
In Copenhagen last year, the large gasemittes, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans which were to shake the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
From this balance sheet, however, you still have to draw up 5 degrees in order to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020, in order to prevent this exempt control.
In the white gloves 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produces the light.
With the compact liabilities, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED lighting birns that have been reduced by the two times.
The compact limbs keep between 6000 and 100,000 hours in cutting.
The new LED gloves, such as those brought to the market by the producer Philips this week - this society has taken part in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumed 80% less energy than a white-growning pearn, which provides the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that there are very little very novel gluttones, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that completing fuel birns show reserves as they contain mercury and that they must be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except producers provide an acceptance site.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury missions on the planet does not represent the compatibility birn, but rather the carbon power plants, which expose significantly more mercury to produce the exhausted electricity contaminated by the white gloves.
Only in the United States, these carbon power plants explode 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report provides detailed information on the profits of each country thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollar annually when purchasing electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, i.e. an equivalent of 3.5 carbon power plants whose production would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivoorkusts expect the announcement of the election results
UNO-General Secretary Ban Ki-Mon has called for the "incomprehensive" publication of the results of the Presidency's election of Côte d'Ivoire after its expiry of time.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need of independent election commission to receive their work and disclose the provisional results without further suspension," stressed a press speaker of the UNChef.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Ivoorkust to prove their responsibility and to contain each initiative until the preliminary results are announced."
Deadline, which was determined on Wednesday around midnight, had made three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
Circa had confirmed 40 minutes before the expiry of the CEI on the TV that the Commission would "go on working" to proclaim the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become hard, but CEI may finally cry out the name of the winner of the second round of election under the Gbagbo and its opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo Lager calculates with the abnormalisation of "deceitious" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the Ex-Rebells camp of forces nuvelles (FN) during the suspension of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidency campaign of the Côte d’Ivoire, had confirmed that the manoeuvres practiced by the FN had scarced the Presidents of the President to go to election in the north of the country.
The whole choice could be abnulled if the complaints submitted by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contrahents are now more of the view that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north, who disproportionates any connection with the ex-rebells, has assessed the delay when proclaiming the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them even if he has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His bonding party reaffirms Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results as he knows that he has lost; and to submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after the election commission is obliged to publish the results, be illegal.
The second round of the presidency elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the association and reconciliation process of a country that was divided into two parts over years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the politicians of the Ivoorkust that they could be held responsible in the event of possible exclusions.
On 31 October the first voting round was 38% of the votes compared to the 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who made public support from the former President Henri Konan Bédé (25% in the first round).
Loans in France remained stable in the third quarter
In the sense of the International Working Office (IAA) in the Metropole, the unemployment rate in France is at a stable 9,3% (including the overseas departments to 9,7%), the provisional, season-unified information published by the Statistical Office of Insee.
The unemployment ciffer in the metropolis is established to 2.631 million.
The second quarter of the year was 9.3% of the acquisitional population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In addition, 3.4 million employees of the French metropolis were not busy in the third quarter, but they wished to find a work, including whether they were now inappropriate for every two weeks or not or whether they were working seeking or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has increased 24.2% in the metropole (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points above the year) and 25% in the involvement of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people were unemployed between 15 and 24 years after IAA.
The Senioren, on their part, have seen a light increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of over 50-year-old persons, 6.6% in addition to the overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropole (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France in total.
After contesting its calculation procedures, the Statistical Bundesamt Insee has not published the monthly unemployment numbers since 2006.
Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues to continue in this method and announced a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a dissorging company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Region of Bouches-du-Rhône (PS), a investigation procedure was initiated and he was delivered into the prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation procedure on the public and fraud-determination markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of civil society's capacity, contamination of general goods, heating, cooperation in corruption, unauthorised order and arms owners, his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini has campaigned and has proposed to speak about all the questions that the lawyer will ask him to distribute instead of Hirngespinst."
"It is easy to submit to him a series of criminal charges, another thing is to prove this," said his lawyer Florence Rult of the AFP (Agence France Press) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (party socialists) in the department, had valued the Judge to be given a memorial to his justification by his lawyers.
Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to the lawyer Lucien Simon, her mandant had never done anything different than his depony he had to lead.
As regards the business skills sector or the target location of the funds involved, he never had been aware of it, says Simon.
Daniel Pinna, former director of the Public Service of the Aubagne Ballungsraum, was also accused on Wednesday for submission and complication, but then under the obligation to keep free foot under judicial supervision of the protagonists of these acts.
"My mandant could provide explanations about the facts that were suspected to him."
"The governor took into account note of robbing him of his freedom, his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four other persons were charged and were released from the prison from the prison in the evening of Tuesday on Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, said the Deputy Super State Anwalt Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is directly pursued by "unauthorised influence and passive order".
Two officials of the Aubagne Ballatory Area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, who were arrested by a contractor of public services on the basis of the title "Accountry and contamination of general goods", the other because of "communications in the contamination of public funds".
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of the "Healing and Unterschlagung von Gesellschaftsvermögen".
To those who were opposed to Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard has recently been arrested due to a similar affair of fraud in public hands affected by Corsica.
The Fahners suspected his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
In April 2009, the study against X for mutatisfactory fraud in the contracting of public contracts, in particular in the dissorging industry, is conducted by an anonymous letter in the documents of several open investigation procedures.
As a result of close research sources, the investigation concentrates particularly on the conditions of the grant and the operation of a depony in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne territory, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille city area (MPM).
Affaire Clothed Reiss: The Elysée Palace exceeds its mid-treat function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clothed Reiss held, a young French researcher who was held in Iran because of "spionage", the French public in Ateme, put the diplomation into alarm and accentuate the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
All of this under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and the newspaper "Le Monde" give some background reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to give these advices to deal with their own crisis of "crises" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French responsibilities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of young French was not the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and have been awarded by American justice because of trade with material for Iranian nuclear programs.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this the idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of clothed rice, in a glorious light.
In fact, he had nothing done in this respect.
An diplomattelegramme dated on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French Comments on the way of handling with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée consultant in strategic questions, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Oray for North Africa and the Middle Orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained her the French method.
They ride the Americans to put everything in order to resume their own nationals, which would hold forcely in Iran.
"Might noise," they said, "articulated loud and clearly and without discouraged" the words "Grund human rights", "indebted", "fortunate release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into embarrassment that is very sensitive to its image.
"Don't do this anymore, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do that."
Because "See-speaking doesn't solve anything," the discussion attempts passing through unreasonable ways that Iranians are "Meisters in Backmanoovers".
Mr Richier adds that the assumption of foreigners is a "gouble, iranian tactics": "sustainment for political depression".
He announces the release of Clothde Reiss from the prison (who should come to the Iranians on 16 August, on the day when she flews into the French message) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 Euro chewing).
And he lets clarify that Elysée antizipates further hostages, a phenomenon that will "very intensify".
The Iranians could "in close future arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotted rice has been released from prison 12 days ago but will continue to be held in Iran.
A information has been transposed: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery is required by the United States due to illegal trade with sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from the liability following the decision of a Judge in Paris.
The American message is, as many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington pursued the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition by the material provided for for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand represents a bad news.
Has France purchased a cow trade ?
The Iranian liberation against the Franzosen?
During a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "perfect surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to reject.
"It has given a rain exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (Michèle Alliot-Marie time), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be supervised by the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant chooses a phone number, relays up, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian, "is now in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the warrant of clothed rice in Iran, the Elysée does not know how to make his efforts to play a "belangful" and "influential middle role by the media" the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays.
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
One of 25 August 2009 dating telegrams cried up "mediablitz of the French authorities".
On the basis of so much "Dank testimony" to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy is questioning.
"Trotz of their statements full of praise gives the French authorities secretly that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then covers the reasons that the elysée has brought to the end of this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "develop to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening against Syria", he analyzes.
In 2008, a policy launched "at that time, many critics in France and abroad have been described as burned and undeserved".
"The Syrian role upbuilding" attempts to lead Paris "Syria in mind what reward you can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sea between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from good source.
On 11 August, François Richier had trusted her: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrian has always done anything".
"But we thanked, despite all of them."
"This should at least stimulate confusion with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the elysée.
In a communiqué he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for its "active role in the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is a law called "the ashbrew" which is forbidden to play online games after midnight by locking them the access of the government responsible for them.
A draft law aimed at refusing the online games operators to reject the access to these games under 16 years after midnight, the Parliament is presented in December, painted representatives of Cultus and Family Ministers.
"Many children play these games for the whole night and then have problems with learning in the school and also to lead a normal life day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure its health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this draft law of the Ministerial Officer of the French Press Agency Agence France Press.
The online games were then accessed again from 6 p.m.
The manufacturer companies had a year to prepare for the application of the law, so he clarified.
The government also insists on requesting manufacturers to shake the time limit granted daily for access to these games to those young people whose parents asked for it, added the responsible.
It will also make available to those who wish to make it free of charge to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most commonly "netified" countries, and the newspapers regularly report from various Internet use events.
The country is also unangugented Champion in global online game competitions.
In November, southern Korea had won four more gold medals in the World Cyber games compared to 58.
World Championship 2018-2022: the FIFA commences the Ausrichterland
In a bright excitement, due to corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee of Exhibition on Thursday the world's founders' countries and 2022, a highest political choice in which the ranking around influence and the lobbying threatens the technical criteria in the background.
One thing, however, is certain: the 2018 King's discipline of FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional highburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new areas (Katar, Australia), or to follow its office in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities which are associated with delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of State, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) represents the measure of the economic and political use of a World Championship.
It is therefore necessary to keep the make-up behind the clauses up to the last minute.
Difficulty otherwise to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA Evaluation Report, English, Spanish-Portugiesian (2018) and American (2022) Act provide more arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executifkommite at the hour of choice.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the suspension of two members of the Executifkommite (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the enthusiasm, could even be able to ruin the chances for her own country, wheat of football, which could only be able to perform the World Championship in 1966.
The BBC had again given the nutritional floor on Monday by embraced a documentary report which took three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reasoning enough to angry the FIFA and to bring the English responsibles in embarrassment, which had, firstly, operated with David Cameron in these last weeks a intense praise.
The head of the government hopes to retreat the chess of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of Olympic Games in 2005 for London in 2012.
Would this intense use be enough to re-evaluate the picture of England before the comite?
Nothing is less safe because the duo Spain portugal is not missing in truffles with its already finished stadies, his expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and his soccer culture.
But the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could fight their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English countries as well as the doubts about solitaire Spain and Portugals give rise to the opportunities of Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite its holes in the map (Stadien, Hotels, Transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to approve the inevitable remedy on the views of the English press "a unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the Members of the Commission.
"You're throwing it with dirt, you're trying to compromit them," betrayed Putin.
For 2022, the United States seem to be strengthened by the 1994 experience to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA headsponsors, the country seems to show a long list of advantages compared to Japan and South Korea, which separately created a very beautiful project.
But these new candidates seem to be frustrated for two countries who had organized the competition in 2002.
Another threat: the welcome of the WM 2026 for China, which leaves the Asian opportunities to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, who had drawn all the registers with the expectation of futuristic stations, the FIFA pursues its extension towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk, for certainty.
Australia could, as well as Japan and South Korea, suffer under the weaknesses of television rights which are acquitted by the European countries (as a result of the time shift), the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: publicity
The Gaulle was really scattered.
In the middle, he had believed that he could use.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least torture.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée next calls.
The current Head of State will be candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not well faced by the Mystery side of the Presidency's function.
So you have to do as if the doubt is fortaneous.
In one, as well as in other sense.
In 2006, the followers Jacques Chiracs suggested that a third mandate was not excluded without even faith in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured his decision "annual in the autumn of 2011".
On Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP Parliamentarians, he would have distributed the perspective of "two man data", after that.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Far missing.
The President simply reminded that the Constitutional Change of 2008 limits the number of five-year-old terms to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidency election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained them in July 2009.
At a new in May 2010, "Don't believe I don't think about the phase afterwards."
His words of prescribed ones no longer make him a candidate than the day before, but not less.
If they call comments, then for a two-fold reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
It is not the recording of competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy drives to manifest itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, who encourages many members of the PS more early than adopted to fight.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the voters of the Rights would prefer a candidate of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to the survey of the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," immediately and carefully responded the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he was found a precipitation as possible, he would not be candidate," Jean-Pierre Rafharin shared.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has found himself with openness.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of the euros
The last Assembly of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should offer opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional measures of the monetary policy, which will come to the end of the year.
The crisis of European State debt is obliged to not afford the Frankfurt Central Bank to deal with the present more than stressed situation in the European bond markets in order to avoid the worsening of them.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister of Finance Christine Lagarde was welcomed by the ECB at a press conference on the active role taken by the ECB for the solution to the European State Budget Debt.
It has not been waiting for it to believe that the Central Bank could do more, for example, by acknowledging its programme of purchases of State bonds.
"I have my considerations for my European trading partners (...)"
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB had, on the occasion of his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, had not been very speaking with regard to his projects, but rather endeavoured to point out that the programme of purchases of people on the secondary market would be "wide-sized" and that we are "looking what decisions are taken out at the Thursday meeting".
The only guarantee is that the ECB will leave its guide rate unchanged at 1%, the historical lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the commitments of the Treasury Board have been doubled by the ECB last week to about EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to discounts of some merchants, she should have done new purchases on Irish and Portuguese people yesterday.
Since May 2010, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros.
The traders do not doubt the anti-zipation of a follow-up of the purchase course (see page 29).
People's businesses do not expect any remarkable course change.
If the loan transactions will have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal for more than three months, the latter will still make up the unlimited reserves for free-to-use reserves, over a period from one week to three months.
Today, the people's business is already taking the view that this measure will continue to extend for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme essentially."
"In addition, she would be able to provoke new tensions in a short view," says Michael Schubert, Commerzbank's people's business.
"One progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely," on the other hand Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to its interventions on the State debt market, "the ECB would maintain such a purchase volume of obligations that are liable to the market", adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the exponent position of European banks on the euro area markets, the Central Bank has no choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter into the market at every price to the authorities of the lack of investors and act so in order to prevent the excitement of profits paid to the weakest countries," said a major obligation holder yesterday.
For if the rates of interest are used for the high flight, the States would be obliged to reduce or stabilise their debt.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Government of Berlusconi goes in Italy in covering
After a weekly start for Italy, the situation has been relaxed yesterday with the decline of corner rates to 10 years.
A return to cheating silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Economic Minister, Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "unentrepredictable" and expected to hear him with a "unpredictable" weekend, however, which immediately demented the subject.
In any event, on Tuesday, the bar with the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the conkurs risk have risen to 263 points, which had led to certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had noted at the Council of Ministers that the discrepancy of Spain is at 400 base points at the German interest rates.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had expressed himself as "swift concern" from the "mark turbulences" and a possible threat to infecting from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third national economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, its problem is the deterioration of economic growth and the incoming, inadequate tax inputs that risk the State to no longer cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
At present, an Italian growth of 1,1% in 2011 and of 1,4% in 2012 is expected... although the budget budget is calculated at the Senate for examining with 1,3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calibrates, the budget deficit will continue to cover 4.3% of GDP in the next year (when the governments predicted 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (or 2.7%).
That is why the call for a new budgetary collective which could be used at a sum of 7 billion euros after the holidays.
"If necessary, new saving measures must be taken," Olli Rehn says economic auditor.
Italy receives support for international institutions at the hour.
"The basic festivals of Italy's economy are okay and its accounts are regulated, we have been repeating for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian Treuhänder of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IWF.
"There are currently no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, because, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d.R.) lower stabilisation progresses are required than by other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, headquarters of the OECD.
The question of political uncertainty remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a remarkable request from the Chamber of Representatives, as a result of which the proposed elections could be organised at the end of March.
So there is a little favourable period for a decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans think of the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had stressed it last night in a press conference in Paris: "I believe that it was still shown on Sunday afternoon and also on the evening: Europeans keep clearly together, are ready and engaged to defend their currency as well as their currency area."
Although it was perfectly relatively - the yesterday recorded deduction in the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
But from the beginning of normalisation, it cannot be the speech yet.
The Rating Agency Standard & Poor had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt remark, the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptivity that is particularly burdening on banking systems," says the people's effects of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially, especially "the political time is far slower than the markets".
The European countries, which are aware of both this air and the danger that is hidden in it, intensify the discussions on strengthening the already existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal consultations between the most affected ministers of Finance and in the further sense with their counterparts of the G20.
And this also in the light of the Eurogroups and Ecofin meetings in the beginning of the next week.

As regards the EU Tacility Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started its Asia-Tour on Tuesday in Singapour to inform the investors in Fernost about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.

Yesterday, an official American representative of Reuters Agency had entrusted, the United States supported a possible increase in the Fund mobilised by the additional, direct commitment of the IWF.
Portugal and Spain, the first series of countries, are sending themselves to take structural reforms, especially in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms, which are to be added to saving measures, are to show effects in the nearer future.
Lisbon and Madrid described another way than this has done Greece and Ireland.
Both one and the other is at every price to prevent international aid before setting up their own budget correctively and have decided on unusual structural reforms, which will rely on them on a permanent basis.
The European capital leaders are again talking about the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of the markets of state bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on the journey in Paris on 24 November, had first produced the idea that if the 750 dollars were not mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to take up its own bag again.
As regards the European State debt market, Barclay's capital's national businesses, judged that an extension of EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidityprice.
This means: the European mechanism of dotering financial stability, which is currently EUR 60 billion.

Snow and Glatteis: 24 Departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow-episodes are still inferior to transport problems, especially in the broad-day secondary transport networks, and threatening different economic activities.
Four and twentieth departments are now at an alarm level of Orange due to the threatening snow and glatteis risk.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vine have added 20 departments already at the alarm level of Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers tangle the north of the Gironde and the charentes, it is easy to cut on the et Ile-de-France.
In the covered departments, snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, some of 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is remarkably enough to impair traffic disabilities and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are locked for heavy transport of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in the Bretagne is very difficult, and the use of some TER buses has been overlapped all day.
In the Picardy, school traffic was evaporated for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures for heavy transport were provided on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to the highest caution on the streets and to adapt their driving behaviour."
The General Directorate for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to scatter 25% of their flights started by the Paris Airport Roissy and 10% of Orly from the expected snowfall.
The DGAB recommends the passengers to contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in southern London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are locked until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy in the Ile-de-France has been in full, it rains billions.
At least in discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion are reminded of the Metro Grand Paris, which will be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead to the construction of the SGP, the State has launched a capital dotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to lend part of the financial sum to its twofold in the markets.
Today, finally, it came to first high accounts.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which is based on the financial commission of the National Assembly, shall contain the measures provided for in order to bring up the first part of these funds.
It is two measures: the creation of a special tax on the locking and higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de France.
First, Article 15 of the Draft Law goes "to the most public legal event Société du Grand Paris".
This is important: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
Secondly, a re-ordination of the existing company taxation is: "to modernise this to increase the product from its product and to address this increase in the société du Grand Paris".
How much would it bring?
A puzzle.
This sum is not relevant in the text.
From the 4 billion you're far away.
"It is performed that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euro of the capital dotation raised by the State and the Société du Grand Paris is being carried out onwards for the project," the explaining statement is to be taken.
The SGP does not find this system anyway.
"Since the moment in which you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover projection for more than three years and then create 4 billion" is explained.
"This is noted and decreasing in the budget."
SGP suggests that 2013 will be started to notify the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four billions are promised to be searched for for a long time, is in danger of creating a fairly motivated, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Racious hackers and embroidery spoons
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a two-fold significance.
On one side, it has been disappointed as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is just a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs the relations between the States, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces deeply-reaching changes at international level, and gives a premature to the future dominated by regression.
But let's go on the row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each document created by a secret service (a X-party nation) is merely composed of newspaper sections.
The "exceptive" American enthusiasms about sexual habits Berlusconi do not discard anything more than what you got to read over months and in any x-less journal (except those whose owner Berlusconi is) and the frightening caricaturated profile Gaddafis offered cabaret artists for their sketch for long time.
The rule, after which the secret directories are allowed to consist only of known news, is essential for the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will recognize that each work (over the grey, the mysterium of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosen Crosslers) is exactly repeated what was already written in previous works.
It is therefore not only that the author of occulted texts does not want to publish accounts (and therefore he did not know where news would be found about the non-existent), but because those who wiped with occultism believe in anything other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Similarly, the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and faul (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (or otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor of libération), who only considers what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which had sent the American message to the State Declarate in Rome, was the same as those who had already published the week before.
So why was such a rehearsal made about the discoveries of these directories?
On one side, this is what each trained person already knows, and although the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then, the Heads of Government can call on each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representative work, changed into spionage centers.
Every viewer of research films knows this very precise, and it does not happen from hypocrisy that you do so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly hurts the task of hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy into a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-love hacker can attack the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world, is the significant strike of the prestigious of the state deceased.
In addition, the scandal brings less the victims than the "shammer" in distress.
But we are devoted to the deeply glorified nature of what happened.
Once, at Orwell’s times, all power could be bundled like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has since been able to have been perfectly correctly exposed where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, any transaction made, the visited hotel, the selected carbahn and so on; the citizens would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you find out what is going on today that even the secret crypts of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, then the control process stops to be one-sided and will be circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chooses as a civilian's armor - can experience the secrets of power.
How, though, can a power that is no longer able to maintain their own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels is in the ground a secret is free of secretis, as it presents the public spheres; but in the style of WikiLeaks, to reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them every power.
WikiLeaks did not do Sarkozy nor Merkel injustice, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this barrier which has been added to such a mighty power?
It is obvious that the countries in the future will not put any more reserved information online - that would be similar to one of the road corners.
But it is also obvious that it is with the current technologies to hope that confidential reports can be kept secretly via telephone.
Nothing is easier to find out if and when a Head of State moved away in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could certain relationships be held in the future and only for certain ears?
I am very well aware that at the moment my prediction is sounding according to science Fiction and romantic, but I do not need to introduce the government agents to motivate themselves in a secret way on uncontrollable marsh routes, their communications nowhere else than in a mere memory, and also the few written information they have received in the shoes.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed leaflets: the Spionageruch of Watergate had in principle less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing today like a cancer, namely backward.
One century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (phonic) wire.
The (analogues) video cassettes have enabled film researchers to communicate a film volume for bands by spoiling from back to front and lying all the secrets of the assembly while (numerics) CDs are now not able to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
With high-speed trains you will drive within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires three and a half hours per aircraft.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication technology come back to car and horse.
A last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what miracles were smiling between the messages.
Currently, it is the messages demanding confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France has its financial promises beautifully spoken
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly dissolved financial promises (also called "Fast Start" or frustrated financing) that have been realized by developing countries.
And already the big French beautiful speech trips are discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7,2 billion euros over three years, France EUR 1,26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn all registers to convince its partners from the fact that their commitment to the fast-start financing is: detailed action report of their Member States, press conference, large additional event, brochure distribution.
The operation of transparency is remarkable and gradually estimated for its actual value: the developing countries and civil society are pleased to see if all developed countries made the same at the same level of precision.
In 2010, the EU announced that we have released 2,2 billion euros, which brings them to the right way to respect their commitment to 7,2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" in accordance with the Copenhagen Treaty in order to ensure that additional use was introduced without a disadvantage of public development aid.
Unfortunately there is no consensus about what means "new and additional".
While the EU Commission proposed a harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today everyone chooses the direction value he considers the best.
The EU Commission, for example, has been a guided value for those of 2009: international finances are maintained, and will contribute 150 million for three years in the framework of the "Fast Start" financing.
Other countries have chosen similar guidelines, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France was of the opinion that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no correct values for expenditure in the previous year or at global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of the French support of developing countries can remain stable (or decreasing) - France proposes to maintain its commitment in terms of new and additional financing.
Another crucial element is the ecryption in donations and loans.
There is no rule on this, and everyone chooses its accounting mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 borrowing € as equivalent with 1 communicated €.
Apparently, this is only difficult: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain rentable investments (partially linked to emissions reduction projects based on effective technology) can be justified, it is tricky to present the euro, which is equivalent to euros that are employed as equivalent... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the capital hosting country should be calculated as an commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following reason: it is "respected" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and spending 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that makes loans large use.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including) fulfil their obligations to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the majority of the European Union spends €1.000 for fulfilling its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and understands comparable use.
That's a nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dairy: partly with further development of the action over time and, on the other hand, with the reality of financial use.
France manages to believe that 420 million "new and additional" millions have spent in accordance with its promise and shared 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (what it seems like it was Bercy that has done the Arabs) could draw a double negative effect; once EU interior (what the other Member States continue to lend it?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not fully deceived...
The chapter of financing is only a small question of relatively short time compared to the overall number of discussions on the climate.
But the drop could be too much in the enormous machinery of UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
As always, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of frustrated finances.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its booking type for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward the discussions on the conflict of long-term finances (a different, crucial and currently discussed issue): the question of "reliability" or the type of its loans cannot be found.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as it is with other things.
So hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, which will meet in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement on the fast-start of France and its vision of "reachability" and the use of loans from naturally from the international trust base, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticide taken by children
A child of 10 years takes several chemical substances over the day 81, so one this Wednesday published by the Association of Génération's Future (formerly movement to protect the rights and respect for coming generations).
The association explains that their results "within view of the small number of analysed samples, do not reflect a statistically significant value but represent illustration characters of the problems treated," had usually purchased within four, from a 10-year-old child to meals plus a meantime in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals, including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day, have been studied as well as laboratories of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other harmful substances.
The counterparty is deteriorating: 81 chemicals including 42 as possible or probablely creative and five classified as safe cardiacs, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disorder factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in the nearest totality of cases, the legal limits for each chemical, individually inhabited substance are not exceeded, this survey is very good that the reality in which the consumer may be disposed of creative substances or substances with endocrine disorder is exciting," the association notes.
Only the butter and the tea with milk contain more than ten of the possible creative residues and three safely as carcinogens, as well as more than 20 residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil as a meantime for the study shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch where the study has detected traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
Furthermore, the hacksteak, the tuna was dispatched from the büchse, even the Baguette and the cow of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the lead water, the analysis made the presence of nitrates and chloroforms light.
During dinner, the salmon stack was identified with 34 chemical residues at the "richest", and even the plastic teeth used to warm up in the microwave was not unlasted.
The final risk of this "subsidious cocktail" for consumers is "likely underestimated," says the study.
On the other hand, Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "as regards the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "to increase in civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had identified the presence of residues 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
