28-year-old cook found in San Francisco Mall dead
A 28-year-old cook that was recently moved to San Francisco was found in the staircase house of a local shopping center.
The brother of the sacrifice said that he could imagine no one who would want to harm him, "Indefinitely it went up with him."
The Leichnam found on Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, and the department of judicial medicines in San Francisco shared.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cooking in Boston, had excited his dream job as a cooking in the Sons & Daughter Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team working like a close family and we're gonna miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and compassion are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia indicated that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "the things went up for him finally."
"He found a apartment, he had a friend," Louis Garcia KGO told him.
Louis Galicia said he could imagine nobody who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a great heart.
His kind of connection with his family was to always cook us something to prepare us for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who swept with the current.
"In all that runs in the world, he was this unleavened diamond, who brightly illuminated every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case shall be invited to call the SFPD note phone under 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'll always be placed in drawers
Jennifer Aniston must not always be perfect or successful.
This has made the Hollywood star in an interview quite clear.
"I'm always going to put in drawers or get out of outside labels that mostly have little to do with me and the reality."
"I don't have the desire to always be perfect and successful."
"Evently said, these things are me rather snatching."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about it as "mix perfect" as it explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress likewise spends her time at home, forming TV with locker shower and mexican food, says in the magazine.
To the white globe they ask the question about the child's wish: "We don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new movie "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film is running with us from 25 August.
Golf longer receives the sport pyramid
His experience on the horse is overlookable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, searched for a bit of deviation with an exit on the beach.
For the 58-year-olds it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Goldene Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their celebration evening, they hunted home in the fast galopp to the feed troughs.
A kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.
"It was not a good experience," said Longer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournaments - were back near horses.
He left his family over the ALRV plant, and he didn't even forced himself for photo purposes.
The first time was in Aachen and thus also in the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid gave the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.
For awards, it is not the sympathic sporter.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Michigan, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already aded him.
Longer is the 18th prize player of the sports pyramid.
He met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler in Aachen on Saturday.
"This award means me very much," said Langer, "and it is not only for sports successes but also for social commitment."
For decades, long-term growth has been promoted.
And so he continued the price money of EUR 25,000.
With 15 more outstanding sportsmen, the two-fold American masters' winner was taken into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports".
Among the exhibitors, the light athletes are hardweight Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the founder Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahr Myhard Taker, Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Spring driver Alwin Schockemholte and posthum of the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports leaders came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrated society went to the Spring Stadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer held distance to the big animals.
Clintons and Trump's economic policy compared: It's all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that's what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. representatives are in tax and energy policy as well as in a principle question.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
He, about the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep it smaller in doubt and warns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to control the economy for deaths and to regulate deaths, he says.
He himself would be quite different, claimed Trump.
It will drive down massively and makes it strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private persons and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the State has certain tasks, has a disadvantaged opportunity to open up and needs money for it.
That's why the taxes for the realms would increase, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Tronel and Clinton are going to be invested at almost the same time.
The democratic candidate even announced the greatest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty flights of the Republicans.
So, to Trump, there might be some internal discussions.
More important are the differences in energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and resume coal transport in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, and the Paris Climate Protection Agreement wants to proclaim it.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand the renewable energy and calls: "A country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It'll be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it."
But not only in infrastructure, even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.
TPP, the transfusion trade agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, however, the USA do not want to isolate international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They are to be better paid, for example calls for Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.
He wants to increase it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum wage must be raised, then he says that he will not be changed.
But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to discharge the economy and the citizens to curb growth.
His critics prescribe him that the budget deficit would only be greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution.
Flood: "Every flocked woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatic.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen, four women are sitting.
Everyone has a baby who is at least a year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curiously in the room with great eyes.
His mother stars on the table plate.
Until she realizes that she's being observed.
She smiles short and kisses the little ones.
The scene normally works.
Before you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a Condrobs sector leader, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and is part of the subject of women’s escape.
The four women in the kitchen are flavoured.
They live in Munich north in one of the few decentral accommodations for alone-flooded women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobs created the establishment together with Pro Familia and Munich women's assistance.
She has recently been opened officially.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
Men aren't there - not as a visitor.
The exception is a guardman before the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say, every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Mans are fleeing for wars because they are politically persecuted because they threaten to torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hopeful," she recalls.
There are other reasons for escape in women: "Many are stealing secretly because they do not see any other way out."
In their home, they have made experience with sexual violence, forces, honorary murders, slavery, or forced prostitution.
She continues.
It's going on to flee.
"The slepper, for example, demands a sexual action for a bottle of water, is no rare," says Bahr.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that it ended as soon as they come to Germany, wrongly, says Bahr.
Also here, only women in refugees would often be considered inferior and badestly abused.
This leads to some 90 percent of women living in the north of Munich, they estimated.
"One of the children haven't created volunteerly."
Many women were so habitated that they wouldn't say anything.
"or they don't trust to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too large."
Since they often don't know how to help, it needs more accommodation only for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the provision of refugees.
The question whether they knew of a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some with no answer.
In the upper palm and overseas, there is no such thing in the governments' accommodations.
In Schwaben too, flocked women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press speaker of the government.
In Upper Bavaria, under- and medium-sized francs there are floors or own houses for women and their children only.
The exception is Niederbayern, there are only two central accommodations for women.
The European Parliament also calls on the Committee on the Rights of Women and Gender's Equality, that women must be put separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it states: "It is very important that men and women are separately stored."
"If the privacy or men and women are spent together, it can come to - continuing - violence against women."
Especially the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women is in the study.
As much as women feel this need for protection, you can reject on the Andrang that is available to the house in Munich.
"She talked about us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors stroke: requests for new labour campaign measures
Deputy representatives of the Assistant's doctors have invited their union to authorise new labour campaigns in their disputes on a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called on its entire Council to adopt more labour campaign measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that it had allowed Ministers to take care of the Treaty.
Assistant and medical students agreed in July on the refusal of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "harryly quiet" to problems, which led the contract to be rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and requests official re-treatment to all your concerns."
Today, as a response to the weakness of the government, the JDC Board has presented a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to authorise an ongoing programme of work campaign measures that begins at the beginning of September.
The disputes led that asistance doctors stressed this year six times, the first total losses in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the election of refusing the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.
He shared BMA members during the meetings which were still held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, with the view that the contract should be beneficial and acceptable.
After the vote, Mr Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be invented pregnantly.
Russia and Turkey: A "Allianz from outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to an official end of the eight months of lasting war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterparty in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't turn away from the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile worked narrowly and he rayed hardly heat, even for his retirement conditions.
Recep Tayip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even improved.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had taken herself as would never have happened something bad.
I seemed to show his enthusiasm the opposite.
But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable cooling showed that the state head of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his words: the committee of a Russian fighter at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was crazy.
Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen Russia in the backs.
The passage was even larger because it was committed by a ill-minded friend.
Rebuilding fatty will be difficult if not even become impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a strong, unlimited attack on Ankara.
Once it seemed like the doors were wearing the guilty for everything.
Most seriously, the accusations of governing officials were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria’s areas controlled by the so-called Islamic state.
He struck this vehement.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the president Erdogan the excuses he wanted to hear.
Russia could book a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a armor silence are clear.
Erdogan firstly needs all the friends he can get after he was exhibited last month in a failing state district nearly his office.
Renewed terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90 %.
In Russia travel organisers and charter companies will be easier when the flights are resumed.
They are on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, the state-of-state view prognosted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti was: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the west, since it considers its reaction to the attempted acquisition as a weak answer.
In this case, the continuing wrist comes to the snatching rate of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is invited to benefit from cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.
The Russian Head of State gained a bonus in Ankara for the attempted state aid for the chosen state bodies.
This is well-remarked for Moscow by a sensation that has even a deep fear of regime change.
The summit meeting at the sea in this glanceful palace enabled Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyticist once described, "Allianz from outsiders": two countries who were infringed and badly treated by the West and now bound themselves.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently was the role as a peace foundation, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be noteworthy that after almost three hours of initial talk, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even been stripping the issue.
The President of Turkey had no doubt to answer a question about its differences, while Putin decided to demonstrate it.
There is no clear consensus on where a common minor can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster - than the NATO member of Turkey shoots the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State talk at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is intended to be reduced only to a backoffice wheel, according to the Chief Board of the Bank.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has been distant since when she had to be collected and saved almost eight years ago.
In this period brand strike "RBS" used to protect other end-user financial marks.
She supported international sports with million pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbleddon Sieger Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to put more national brands into focus.
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentral headquarters and the stock exchange notation will change to NatWest.
The Marke Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private customer business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit to customers and employees in Inverness shire.
He shared the BBC Scotland with: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy, as we become more a bank of brands."
When the bank became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I now say that we do not pursue global objectives, but local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand for something perfectly different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.
RBS has already stated that his Six Nations sponsoring will not continue and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in his sport sponsoring.
"It's time for us to develop to the bank of brands, because how do we concentrate on the inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Board Chief.
It would have been very sympathy for three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches its 3.000th profit at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3.000th winning
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3.000th British profit at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey, which reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won at Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very happy about the fact that Newmarket happened because I've landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banner Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm easier and very modest.
Dettori takes up the jealousy when he fetchs the victory on Predilection
Two Jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retirement 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 wins in a recording career.
Laster Piggott, the nine-time Derbysieger had 4.493 careersiege
Frankie is one of the best Jockey of the modern and there is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that has reached just a few before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactic intellekt, which separates him from the other in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma excited fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago with Epsom that he had already recovered 6,000 profits if he wouldn't be just a weekend and big tournierjockey!
Frankie has already driven in GB nearly 30 years of winners, which is great.
He has a living personality, what is good for a British race, but beyond it he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of large tournament gains, including his famous "gloric seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane absorption and received a drug ban.
Three years ago he had trouble when he returned from his six months old lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to tackle his two bottles and return to his best form.
And he's not at the end for a long time - Dettori has earlier said that he wants to continue to competition until his 50th year of life.
Russia's Putin fired Stab's boss Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his head of Stab Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest trust circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed as a special officer for environmental and transport matters.
In a opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin, without any reason, "the dismissal of Ivanov's obligations as chairman of the Russian presidential administration" has organized.
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.
In 1972, he was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, concluded by the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.
On the Kreml website it says (on Russian) that he was later the Chief of Protocol and Stab's Head of State.
He said about his appointment to Putin: "Thank for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of State with regard to law drafts and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV sender on Friday that Ivanov had asked for leaving his posts and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do you think the smileing faces?
This step has made Moscow mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins and works as he works for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men of the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, which was embroiled in television, both men claimed that the Chief of Stab retreats on his own wish.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced here - especially now, just before Parliament elections.
So, is this the result of a kind of force campaign?
Nobody knows that at present.
However, the official claim - that a man who once was a potential President - would like to direct Russian environmental policy once before - was a great creation.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation early in 2012 to trust these very complicated posts - you could almost say - bad posts for four years.
As it reveals, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the posts in December 2011.
Previously, he was Vice-President and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy representative.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since a third term of office had violated Putin's constitution.
But these posts were taken by another, nearly tied Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became President before he became President for three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he struck producers
Gibson was involved in a physical contradiction at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his announcement in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcement of his announcement.
There were artistic differences and differentiation of opinion at the set.
I repent the incident," he said in a communication.
Details about how the character Gibsons from the series that follows a team of FBI agents will be published at a later time according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg has been with it since the first staff of the series in 2005.
"I love criminal minds and have put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but this will not be possible anymore now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actresses, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only want for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelved staff is set on 28 September.
Puzzle around fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff demanded help in identifying fish that had come up in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could act on sandals that were spoiled by a spring brown.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacular in the hope that someone could throw light on the appearance of the two inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: bridge now connected to Fife
The £1,35 billion project will be completed until May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern corner of Queensferry Crossings to the Viadukt - meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fife.
It is the first of four conclusions of the "deck blow" which approach the completion of each of the three doors of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete as well as 46 screw sails.
The £1,35 billion project will be completed until May 2017.
Minister Keith Brown was visiting the building site today and was one of the first who went from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment during the construction of Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of a engineering art by a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30.000 tons concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viadukt and the bridgendeck is a heated activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passion.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge corners are at their place and the last section of the ceiling is given to a concrete gap in Rosyth today for the ceiling, meaning that the entire ceiling is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone at each bridge project.
This fantastic project represents the conclusion of future high and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road coverage and its connection to the north tower roof, we had to close the still existing lies on the north or country side.
This was reached by dragging the northern donor bridge 700 millimeter south.
This was a massive and simultaneous activity.
Massiv, since the Viadukt is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tons weighed and had to be pulled up at an increase of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances on which the team works were tiny - on each side they covered only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything was very good.
Sale in the Moelfre Bay: Three men have "to be happy yet"
Three men have "glueked to be alive" after they were thrown by their fishermen's boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station took place on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty to swim in security while their boat continued from its own force.
"We saw how the boat turned around and presented us the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have waped the boat out of their reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishermen boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a boying without rescue.
They came all on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have been luckless and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stoppiece, these were discharged from the boat's person who controlled the boat.
Someone's waiting about these men today.
Hard hurt - man sits on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and wounded hard.
As the police told yesterday, the 50-year-old had received the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized daders cut the clothing of his ex-friend.
When they came to the apartment, he put on her twice.
The 44-year-olds were injured on the hand and on the body.
The police could arrest the dadder.
During the 50-year-old the clothing of his ex-friend destroyed, he called his mother.
This alarmed to his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to rest her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her companion.
On the street they met the ex-life companion of the man.
When the two women retreated the apartment again, the 50-year-old burst his sister to the side and attacked his ex-friend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors should be taken much more into the obligation in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next years?
The SPD proposes a "development concept of living at the next Council meeting".
But fight is programmed.
Firstly, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
A regulation is missing until now.
SPD-Fraction President Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: Who wants to build on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."
However, the cheap apartments can also be found in stock.
However, is the big issue in the Council's house, Bratmann says: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent in such areas, but at least 20 percent of the apartments as social housings."
A new urban housing programme that will cost millions and still need to be financed is to provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann says: "There are currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as little as possible.
The left wants to harden the editions for investors.
On the other hand, Bratmann said, a deterioration of the situation on the housing market has been attracted.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More personnel is needed.
It's unclear if we're gonna get the professionals.
However, the programme is not entirely present: for the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built at once.
But how do you like the loss of more than 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion will expire in the next years?
Only until 2020 there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, then the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm, should now be purchased outgoing bindings from the city.
In addition, it should be considered to get apartments back into the price connection.
This is possible in the west town.
The problem was solved at a time.
For in the West City, the periods are expired.
About 1800 apartments can be retrieved back to the price connection for cheap apartments.
Only: that wants owners, not the housing companies.
Because the number of social housings in the western city is renewed drastically, the aim of so-called mixing is to be removed.
There is no longer a concentration of social welfare in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group Chair Holger Herlitschke meant: "For a wide majority, the CDU has to be in the boat."
They have focused on more construction sites for family houses.
But what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet.
Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness worthy
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
That teenager and child no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure to starve on screens, many have been complained in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go, it is about getting people from the sofa and to get more active.
The time on the screen was at the beginning to the TV, then limited to video games and last to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities do not exclude each other.
I, of course, refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (sometimes a series of signs, maps and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of the pop culture were interested in publishing the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market introduction in other countries has been moved through the enormous demand that the server overloaded.
Within less days Pokémon Go had more users than tinders and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
Shortly, the players go outside their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be taken "photographed" (on the mobile screen) or "obtained".
A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the wound and sprang for the sofa's search.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that deposited the " Average" person every day.
Cardiogramme, an App for Apple Watch, followed by 35.000 users, the Washington Post recently informed that within two days after the introduction of the game, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day, demanded 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance increase.
Many public enlightenment campaigns for the health of people who want to "take 30 minutes time," "to come from Sofa" and "beat active every day" stood on doubs ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look eager.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.
A regular sporting person reduces its chances to illuminate cancer or depression.
Body activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to establish them here.
But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something free that makes them fun.
So three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people close on hunting even new friendships.
As always there are musician players who have to embarrass themselves about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What is it?
It's a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had already been able to follow our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sports like this game.
The new will lose his rice and the use will be left out with time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games to unite apps and virtual reality with the active world and help many people in the hunting to be active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in damenturn
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamicly on the spray.
Free on the bar.
Amazing on the ground.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now also Olympician.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament clogged to the multi-campagne title and increased the lie between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light light of the Olympics.
Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" manager Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the bar during the retail camp of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campagne title and in total the fifth while she strengthens her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end.
This success puts them in the same Liga as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated its kind of sports for the last three years, 15 world master medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympicist Mary Lou Retton said that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a last test in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but between her and a load of overdimensionated expectations.
Not with a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left and Aly Raisman embraced themselves after they won gold and silver in the individual camp of women in the art towers at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a calling sign on the deciding celebration of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles was on it during her long way to the top of never planned the future, that is not really true.
Some of their soil exercises - which contain their typical tuna pass - are agreed to late American music that would fit at home on the street outside of the Olympicians in Rio.
That's not a chance.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and trained by Trainerin Aime Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tower hall, was forced by Boorman.
She hasn't lost a multi-campagne competition since the summer of 2013, a victory series that will stop as long as it wants Biles.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two rotations, the image was tricked.
Bubble bars and floor towers in which Biles holds the World Championship title.
She retreated with 15,433 on the silver bar again - and put one on the ground with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman embraced her softly when she expected her end-rest - a pure formality - and tears flowed to biles shining red, white and blue eyeliner than the vision that she once described in her collective book was reality.
Raisman's performance was a racing for the last time four years ago when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went in a tibre on Mustafina.
This time the 22-year-old teamite, called "Oma", had a lead.
After her soil exercise, she warfed the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As regards Biles, the second of the 19-year-olds has a very new significance from the beginning of this week:
Police: 3 victims in serial murder case shot when listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year old girl were shot, who have been killed in one of the most fatal attacks in Phoenix's first series of murders, while they were talking to and listening to music in the car.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a journey, the authorities said.
The dadder fired eight shots from a hand fired weapon while he stood on the car's side and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.
The police noted that the three-fold murder did not seem to be the result of a robbery accident, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was led to the mediators to become a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people have been killed and two more injured within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard shared the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown nitsan from late 1990s, a black BMW from late 1990s and a white cadillac or Lincoln.
The medians refused to reveal the evidence they have concluded that the attacks are linked and have been committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died still on site.
One Witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-fold murder and from the fact that it was the work of the serial killer.
Meditors found cartridge pillows and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microzephalie: "It becomes better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto love singing, toys and of course his mother.
But as the least of his agemates, Edmund Microzephalie, the result of a genetic disorder, which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I don't create that.
I don't create that.
That's what I didn't mean.
Whatever's wrong -- of course, one has left it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they were planning to institutionalize him.
"My first answer was "I didn't know that the people are still doing," said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with help of walking help.
Edmund could not sit or screw until his third life year and he can neither speak.
But he slowly progresss.
He can run with support and ride bicycle.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund thought for "Please sing me before."
"We bring him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical character language -- she says. Edmund has found some characters alone.
Microzephalie has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as measuring or the zic virus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary strongly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an unconscious future.
I always asked what's going on?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't been asking for the prognosis for a long time because I don't expect she can really tell me someone.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of nurses with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heated rainfall, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavi rainfall and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is counted all Saturday with more rainfalles.
Many rivers in the Southeast Louisianas and the south of Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and have already been on the road to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the governor, informed that the requests for highwater vehicles, boats and sand sacks increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sand sacks.
A flood warning system is used over many parts in the south of Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain in this area.
In the southern Alabamas, a floodfresh warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of Mobiles.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will be probable to reach all of the weekend record level.
The meteoologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could overwhelm many houses in the vicinity near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a flow downward flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers are slowly flown into Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest state ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
The Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi were still infused by rescue teams.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and Stiefsohn were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rises strongly over night.
He said that a further stepping son would have warned him near.
"We are awakened and the water flowed and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my taille.
His wife said Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that emergency aiders had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were brought to the Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "shis rapidly spread" because there were still heavy rainfalles and that the authorities would take into account evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer reported in the vicinity of Kingston from midnight to Friday from 13,75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been significantly filled by rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rainfall and road floods caused the salvation of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and educational event in five school districts.
The CBS Chief WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa had 200 overwhelmed houses.
The residents were evakuated in two churches, which were now overwhelmed.
The leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that were swallowed by the highwater.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were established to house the Evakutes.
"When the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their houses," he said.
In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the high water, and sand sacks provided for the residents to take the water from their homes and shops.
"The last big flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy des Harrison County said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to its information, a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported overflowed, but it has not been reported on Friday until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I saw water in places where I have never seen it before," said Townson, "and it still comes."
Mahaj Brown, 6. "Looked by balls," survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child is shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several shoes injuries, including in the lungs, legs, arm and abdomen, but that he was in consciousness when he was transporting to the hospital.
"He has made a lot of time, his small body was slaughtered by balls," his grandmother Delores Melendez shared the sender.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the sender that he was expected to cure again.
He should have started the first class in a local school.
Brown was one of four who were shot in Germantown.
In addition, three men were shot: two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical state; the other two victims are, according to CBS Philadelphia, in a stable state.
The boy was shot on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical state, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police just as to whether one of the males injured could be.
CBS Philadelphia told us that it seemed to have come to a crossfire between several shots.
Patrons for storm guns, which were traced back to various storm guns, overseased the place of act.
It seems that it was clear that it was a persistent fight.
On the street, on both sides of the walkway, the barbecues were.
So there seemed to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved here," said Police Huutpmann Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia to the sender.
There were also several houses and vehicles in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reviewing reports according to the monitoring video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-countryer on the arm when she played before her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She's gonna get her and the police are looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I suggest among the women's olympia team in turn and for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been with every summer olympiad since 1984, and the United States have never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Munro and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, which is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the USA.
It has reinforced the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number was one of the female tournaments a Afro-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Munro was a surprised Olympic winner and America.
Now the world was able to be witnessed to the incredible performance of the three-fold World Championshiper Simone Biles, periodicals and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, but admirable gymastic routes.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, iteroxual American who won gold at a individual multi-campagne event for women.
Mannship member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but this does not look like turn classes throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie started all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it to the Olympics team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But reality looks like turning is a expensive sport and tournament primarily in private tour associations that are maintained by parents who are present for training, institutional, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their tours and families).
The majority of these tour clubs are in prosperous premises that can support the business.
In these associations, the tourers receive their entire training and that is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, Trainerin of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainerin of Laurie Hernande, have trained both their athletes since they started to turn.
We need to allow the municipalities of countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to make it possible for a more varied and easily accessible tour training.
I founded my 20-year-old tour stimulating.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable tour in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home city) to offer young people high-quality tours that deserve the possibility to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport.
Turning develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health, school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in turning and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is so exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thanks, she motivates so many young girls with different background to begin their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after refusing Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped that the dispute on the amendments could be closed by adopting a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted for a choice refused him.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that NHS is engaged in a "None country" and that any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful.
The first assistants are intended to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care at unusual times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Office for Assistances last night, shared in a communication: "Assistance doctors still have serious concerns to the proposed Treaty, in particular that it will heat the current evidence crisis and endure to treat all doctors."
For only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time is out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes by discussions took part in the government in contradiction and sometimes to suspicious silence.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift up the force and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do this, the Assistant's doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further labour campaign measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a burst of nearly 13.000 routine operations and 100,000 deadlines, as nurses and specialists were included to grant doctors on the strike post chain coverage.
Ministers had hoped that the dispute on the amendments could be closed by adopting the reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wishes to have a better remuneration for the 54,000 assistant doctors to be subject to the Treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS employees, asked the assistants to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Working campaign measures achieve nothing of a few but already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, nursers and their families only worries, emergency and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Commission of the Assistant's doctors and have addressed the Ministry of Health and other Ministers positively on the concerns regarding the prevention and the hormone flowering.
Employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional period of time, training boxes, mutual recognition of the training plan, continuationsurlaub and the gender losses in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce heart infarction risk
Thousands of cardiac patients are benefited from a £2 per day medication after the authorities were recommended to administer this more people for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor’s renting medicine reduces the risk of repeated heart infarction for patients with heart disease.
The medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart infarction, reducing the risk of a stroke or further heart infarction.
The Regulatory Authority NICE of the NHS recommended a four-year reception to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The Regulatory Authority NICE of the NHS recommended a four-year reception to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people suffer a heart infarction every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart infarction or a stroke attack.
Heart infarctions and strokes are caused by collections of fatty material in the arteria walls that are illuminated.
If the lage breaks out, it can cause a blood crop that stops the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart infarction.
If the blood gets solved, it can flow through the blood flow and disperse the blood flow to the brain, which causes a stroke.
Persons who had already infected hearts are subject to a higher risk.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name of Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood crops more likely.
The design of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Trotz of the availability of secondary prevention has a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart infarct, another heart infarct or a stroke - often with destructive consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart infarction can have significant negative effects on the quality of a person's life.
Experience shows that Ticigrelor in combination with aspirine is effective in reducing further heart infarction and stroke in people who have already infected heart.
Thanks to a provisional recommendation by Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticgrelor - especially the risk of bloodling - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness gives rise to defence in Muslim areas
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfu Rahman has been removed last year on the application of a government report because of corruption from the office.
A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread democracy in Muslim communities knowfully ignored how a destructive government report today revealed.
The former Kabinetts member Sir Eric Pickles attacks Police, Vocational Observatories and Council houses for ignorating proof of election abuse due to "surempfindlichkeits on Ethnie and Religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Communal Government, who is now an antcorruption king, said that the intimidation of electors from religious motifs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lockers outside of election cabins to protect intimidated choosers.
He recommends that choosers should lead to them to prove their identity during choices.
At present, a chooser must name only its name and address.
The report proposes not to put a dispensable ink on the finger of a person when they give their vote in order to prevent someone choose twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He demands that the press should have more access to local documents and decisions from non-official commissions or working groups.
"This is not only for election fraud but also for the local government to protect from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture, which involves it," he said.
The report was ordered by the Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election scandal in the East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the official mayor Lutfu Rahman was to be dismissed after a litanei on corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court was that Rahman had imverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a way" and that he would have made his critics silent with rassissmus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman should have led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a follow-up in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alarming for fraud - the older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, trained, made several recommendations to clean the voting system, including the carrying out of evidence to prove the identity
In his report, it states: "As evidence was applied that pressure on protective members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the elderly's will, in particular communities with a Pakistan background or a fearful load.
"There were concerns that... State institutions had consciously ignored such behavior due to "political correct" oversensitivitys regarding Ethnia and religion."
Sir Eric expressed 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban that political activists are editing letters of voting documents to stop "doers".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also calls for worse registration checks to prevent the voting directory on immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask choosers before the choice for your hint.
Use non-removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choose twice.
Run systematic verifications on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are voting.
A three-year limitation on applications for automatic letter choice.
Prohibition that political activists are editing complete letter elections and redirections of letter elections.
The police give the power to set up locks for election stations.
A legislative amendment that facilitates a claim for infringement in accordance with the Representation of the People's Act 1983 (Volks Representation Act 1983).
Photographer ban in election stations.
Prompt that only English may be used in the election stations (with exception of Wales).
Intensification of training in order to ensure that employees implement the rule that choosers are going to the cubicle alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "unstablished" that after the Tower Hamlet's case, there was no criminal admission.
"Lutfura Rahman and his deputy representative for a litanei on corrupt and illegal practices has explained as unusual," he said.
It was acknowledged due to a number of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal procedure.
It also criticizes the effective "defensive controls" of the Council's election registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "The judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of Parliaments, is wearing a proud heritage, but the worrying and covered spread of democracy and moisture of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Revolved to Kate's Radler double gang and other famous double gangs from Olympiasportlers in Rio
Fans of the Olympic 2016 in Rio are advised this week via the French bicycle sporter Pauline Ferrand-Prevot outside border and band, which proved to be an impressive double gang of Cambridge's chest.
But the 24-year-old Olympionikin is not at least the only to fight gold anthlet, which reveals its own famous double ganger - at least not if you are allowed to give the social media faith.
To honor the Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces that flimmer on our screens at the time, FEMAIL has created a list of olympionics that show more than just a certain similarity with Hollywood famousities.
The hunt and wolf: Team member of the US Manage in the Bavarian Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood.
Apart from Kate's double gang on the wheel car, many people in the Internet show how a certain bow protector of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The team member of the US Manage in the Bavaria Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images where he saw the Wolf of Wall Street Star in secret.
In fact, the bow protector received the crazy in social media and admitted that he has already been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I do not see a great similarity, with the exception of the facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll find it up as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London in 2012 will undoubtedly become the focus of this year: the surprising similarity between the British Weitspringer Greg Rutherford and the popular actress Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with its large, express-pressive eyes should be able to pass through as a double gang for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimming pool Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One walk higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "atletic version" of the inception actress
Another persistent comparison was drawn between the Tennisstar Rafael Nadal and actress Josh Hartnett, who liked heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal sister Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-burned skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attested by Fans to compare a "atletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Soccerstar Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the similarities
Theory set in the room: This user says there may be a reason for the equation of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredible similar face form and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and their smiles, nearly identical to the one of the actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the Turning Gabby Munro, which reveals its own beautiful, wide smiles, similar to the one of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.

Byron MacDonalds Analysis about the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr 4x200m free-style swimmstaffel admired viewers of the CBC live transfer of Olmypian games on Wednesday
The Canadian sender CBC had to excuse himself, after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "as Mief went down" and during the race like "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was disabled at the end of the 4x200m free-style swimm staff.
MacDonald, who was collected into the CBS team on board to lend more "cold", could say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the approach, baby".

Viewers throughout Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane secondth, "Is the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "How a pig died"??
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on mission."

The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard to talk to him many
Twitter users didn't stop when they heard how unensibel Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and let us look like racists.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC mission, was sorry for the comment by MacDonald and said: "We excuse us that the comment was exhibited about a swimming performance."
It was an unhappyly chosen formulation, we're sorry that it was happening."
CBC at the end apologized about 90 times to the people who replied on Twitter
The commentator colleague Scott Russel had to excuse himself on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his excuses to more than 90 other Twitter visitors who were complaining about the comments of MacDonald
The network also excused himself quickly and gave a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be radiated.
We have quickly entrusted our viewers on mission and our followers in social media yesterday night.
To make one clear, Byron's comments relate to the performance of the swimming force and not to them as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry about what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald excused himself in the mission and tried to justify his comments by saying that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment that I had made after the women's swimm staf in the CBC Olympics, he said.
"I was related to the performance of the swimer and not to them as a person."
Of course, no disagreement was planned and I am so sorry."
Purchasers in Primark are embarrassed by woman who in the middle of business shameless underwearse
The buyers didn't know where to look at when a woman went out her clothing in the middle of a prize to try underhistors.
In order to worsen the situation, she mustered, as she looked out, moved out and reared her back to the shelves.
She continued and tried four few underhosen in a shop in the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark business at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underhoses before she reared her to the Regal
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who had been in business at the same time said that after the mystery woman had tried the underwear, "she went back and left the business without buying something."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sale area, she took a few subheads out of the deposit, pulled out her own strife and pants and tried it.
"She didn't even try to find a bit more discreet place to do it - she was just there, freak like Oskar."
"Every starved, when she reappeared the underhoses, who apparently did not please her, as she put her back into the shelves."
She repeated the same with three further underhoses before she finally decided that she didn't feel enough, went on and went out.
"She didn't seem to be disturbed that she was observing someone - or thinking about the person who would buy the undercovers she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who live in Kent, said: "How misleading to think that someone would take underhook home with a different person who had been inhabited and who had not been washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "How I got with, the employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she went - whatever is the same way."
"I would hate it to go home with a new couple of underhosen and find out that another woman had she had and washed out again and had not been washed."
One speaker of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August in our branch in Folkstone."
All products in question have been removed from the sale.
How to protect with Krav Maga from arms attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it something safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a master of Krav Maga Verband in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers near distance.
Depending on whether one approaches you from front or from back, this video will show you how you turn the spider for your rower.
If you are approaching you from the back, you should turn around as the first, so you can see your attacker and "part from the shot line," says Mizrachi.
Then take the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him into the face with your free elbow.
Put him into the yard with the knee and turn, while the attacker collapses in front of pain, the weapon from his hands. Put him into the face with the loop and move back while they judge the weapon on him.
When attackers approaching from front, the technology is similar - move your body from the shoe line, take the gun and turn it, so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, publish the weight on the gun and put the attacker on the breast, then turn the gun out of his handle before they move back and direct the gun on it.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it is formed by Mizrachi.
But remember that it's safest at a robbery to exceed your money - if you're not Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveller Ian Wright shabs his tongue to the most dirty places of Europe for a travel leader
A British traveler underscored his immune system and the desired reflection of a serious test by discharging some of Europe’s most dirty and delicate places.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, shaved his trains on a euro-shine, a country on the Piccadilly Circus, a dish button of a train toilette and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.
Before placing each object, he used a luminometer to show ourselves and us what he will let himself in.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some amazing results to the day.
The thought that the dish button of a train toilette that has already been used by thousands of others may be totally abhorrious, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen slot.
On his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion ofmbactria and his own health.
Congratulations, nothing that he decorated left more than a bad taste in the mouth.
Mr Wright was known to test the resistance of his insects by traveling through the world and by eating unique things, as well as marvelous things.
From public countries on railway stations to dish buttons of toilets, the task set his immune system definitely under a sample
In the film he told: "I was relatively uncared about my health and I have put all things in my mouth, earth, worms and smell water."
In the film, he was justified by his call in any case.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample abstract showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of fresh laundry hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lie down after their luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands reject one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the bacteria number in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This comes near to the worst thing I've smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing dirty more than that!
I'm not gonna stick anything here because it's in there.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Internal Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.
Mr Wright is taking place with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of domicians and immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, soaps and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstorms that ended that we said "Lass call us Ian."
They claim that the interest in immortal health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put it in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of immortal health and how it is associated with the immune system.
The growing interest in the insult health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary film, we could provide the consumers more information in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of Humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's director, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had been painted some of the things I had proved to leak him, like the eclipse Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to touch them and others with which this was quite difficult.
I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty leckers on film."
In a survey carried out by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all surveys of milkic acid bacteria associated with the welfare of stomach and Darm and 58 percent said that they are at least sometimes using products containing added milk acid bacteria.
A social family destroys before delogging social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
A a social family left her social housing after deloging with a damage of £500,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out after a long list of complaints from their presence in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were removed violently from their estate, the residents found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls show pissing holes, wood parts were knocked up, garbage was scattered on the floor and Graffiti was smelled to the walls.
The family has been surrounded and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.
She said: "It was a absolute album space for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to be taken into account, since this estate is probably considered not so beautiful part of cornwalls.
The family is inclined and her reputation is it too.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment between time and the police said that the terror that the family had added included road fights with baseball attacks, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trade, and excessive shouts, disputes and flights.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which are being removed under circumstances, old waste was found
In the presence in which drugs have been handled in the past, the wood parts were resisted.
Neighbors said they saw fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing delogged her and her partners this week violently from the presence, after they gave them an extended 11 weeks period to withdraw voluntaryly.
The delogin was rejoiced by eased neighbors who said that their life was made to hell.
One said, "They scared for no one."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times that we tell the police here are incredible.
"Tonight we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not inhabited!
Now where they're finally gone, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have allowed the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police had been called in regular distances for 20 years
Müll and old toys were thrown down on the overwhelming side of the municipal house.
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant refused to accept any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family, as a delogin is always the last step to consider the cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, since the behavior was extreme and its actions had to be awaited for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have moved to us and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will bring some neighbors comfort and give the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that is left back in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloging on the ground
Workers of the house management will now have to erase Müllberge that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a Razzia in the house and found more than 70g cannabis as well as Waagen, Paraphernalien and cash amounts of £1.700.
Skeldon received a penalty of money after she had been guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in trading order.
She claimed that the money was for a grave stone of her son Lee Skeldon who killed the life of a car accident in 2013.
After they were without obdach, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many rooms walls of the house were embarrassed with Graffiti.
The police say that she will deloge tenants who aren't holding themselves in the home regulation.
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall told that the delogin was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not keep their home order.
"This is about those who think that they can take without self-prophecies as well as those who have been damaged by such a behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists moved in Portugal in panic after a deep-flying military jet beach flews
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion plane of the air ward forces put an incredible sturt flight
The air warfare forces indicated that there was a training flight, but did not prevent a safety risk.
This was the moment for the fearful tourists to start panic after a deep-fly Jet crashing over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft floated almost nearly in the vicinity of the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro in the northern Portugal.
The vacationers jumped up when they began to make anxious about the noise of the vacuum drives, without first seeing what came upon them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidays who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "There were two times very deep passing and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and felt as if the plane would fall down to me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were moved in panic when the plane came out of darkness and incredible deeply flog
Today, the Portuguese air ward forces stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishermen's boats from the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that because of the poor viewpoints, the Jet was somewhat deeper than usual, but the air warfare forces kept in danger of security at no time.
Surface fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese continent, where four people were also killed on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air warfare forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - strong nebula and fire smoke - which restricted its views.
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with worries against Seville
Seville - The FC Barcelona is fighting around the first step on Sunday to win the first title in the new soccer season.
The Catalans arrive in Duell around the Spanish Supercup towards the FC Sevilla, the return game rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must rely on Neymar in the power measure with the underlying Cupfinalists and governing Europe-League Champion, among other things, which contests the Olympics Football Tournier.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing at the Stegen.
In the course of the training, the German suffered a band stroke in the knee, making the inquiry at Barca at least for the benefit of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Terstegen have been weting in Barcelona for two years around the status as a number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far dealt with a clear decision and left Bravo in the Liga, but in the face of the most other applications.
Before the first compulsory game of the new time, there are doubts to the Spanish master about the fitness state of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince Lionel Messi and Co. even at 3:2 in the samplegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville again has the 2:3 low position after enlargement in the Supercup Europeans against Real Madrid, endeavoring the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is now 11 successes of the record winners in this application.
Ma Long in a own Liga on Tischtennis-Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis olympician.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old in Rio de Janeiro, his countryman and Zhang Jike 4:0, (12,5,4,4) were defeated by a one-sided final.
The world ran the Golden Grand Slam with successes at WM, Weltcup, World Tour Finalturnier and Olympic.
Bronze went to Japan's Jun Mizutani.
The two Chineses worked it as expected in the final game and made up the title among themselves.
Thus it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would bring the single title in the sign of the five rings.
Last non-Chinese on the top of Olympics was the former SVS-NÖ-Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the plate, between the sentences and time-outs they had no coaches with themselves.
They had moved back to the trumpets and left their sculptors in fair competition alone.
"The matches until here I played for my country."
"In the final, I play for me," Zhang said firmly.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners posted with the China fan.
The Match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Mother had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Afterwards he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang there only 13 points.
The supremeness of Ma did not develop the expected corresponding match.
However, there was not enough breathtaking ball change to be seen.
Mizutani won the game around Bronze against the 40-year Wladimir Samsonow 4:1.
The White Russe had accessed a rice in his quarter against the German European Championship of Ovtcharov, then in medical treatment, had to be "last" with light.
The Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) have become in similar high table tennis age of Olympia.
Donald Trump clears violent problems in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. republicans is charged by enormous concerns, too, in traditional conservative states.
Presidentship candidate Donald Trump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the most commonly clear and self-certain multimillionary was expressed as concerns as reported by universities.
After throwing out of the race 16 rivals within its own Republical camp, the doubts about his success in the fight around the White House are now growing.
"We have enormous problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelic Christians who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Debts were wrong reports about his candidate, he resumed his well-known media smile.
Rules of Republic
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June survey of SurveyUSA, Trump and his competitor of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutions see Trump, however, not with the distance common to republic candidates in the state.
The risk is also considered Arizona and Georgia.
In an interview by the sender CNBC, Trump replied to the question how he wanted to stop the Vormarsch Clintons: "Genauso, how I did it."
And shoot behind: This will be "less successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation."
He doesn't make anything else as "to tell the truth."
If it was not rich for him for reasons of political correction, it's okay, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party should have threatened to scatter funds to support his election campaign, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, we want to take the candidates of the Republicans more under the arms for the convention.
Olympia: Threeth fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's Leichtathlets threaten after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemach.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee shared a disciplinary commission immediately in order to examine the case.
A Kenyan functioner had informed that the former Sprinter and today Coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine probes under the name of the 800 meters runner Fergusson Rotich.
This was reported to the Kenya team leadership by the Doping Controls.
The IAAF World Association has requested the IOC for information about the case in order to investigate its own investigations, and an IAAF practitioner informed.
"Apart from the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IOC, IAAF will make an evaluation," said an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed," stated Kenya's head of the Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was owned by the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list of training controls of the World-Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich became more than 800 meters in Peking WM in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Lightathletic Delegation Chief Michael Rotich was delegated by the Rio Games.
He is supposed to have informed sporters of his country about the following doping tests.
According to media reports, he should have been arrested at the airport of Nairobi.
Kenya has been under special attention for a long time after numerous doping processes.
In the announcement of more than 2000 doping target controls for the Rio games, the IOC was noted that particularly atlets from Kenya and Russia are taken into the visual.
The World-Anti Doping Agency had exercised much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-Doping Act and a working control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia beginning.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping fighting is compliant with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered to be a big runner nation.
The country's lightathlets won most medals during the 2015 WM in Beijing.
In a series of television reports of the ARD, prerequisites have been raised that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality in sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last demanded a similar study in Kenya, as he had done it in Russian lightathletics.
It has been demonstrated that this sports type has been sophisticated and systematically.
Russia’s Leichtathlets were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical and fulfill a youth room with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venetian Dirigent Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythmic," he weakens.
We always say that she is very latein American.
There are many latein American ingredients in their tempo and their melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this inszenation Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dancing.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because she is musical extraordinary!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright."
So she is wise, of course also naiv, and very suffering.
"She resembles me very much, my Italian character I have as a Roman," laughed Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
It is an indifferent generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
It's a need to guide him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern Temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that's very important!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly present: "In this piece there are prejudices and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorikans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them to.
They are the same topics, and they are today as strong as then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London school girl who joined IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee's lawyer said that her family had experienced some weeks ago from her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bullwork in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died after information from her family, shortly after she was planning to leave the country of war and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good in it is - as a reminder and warning to others that this is the risks associated with going to a war zone - to keep people from taking this decision ever," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from the East London rose into a plane towards Turkey and then entered into a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and was a widow within a few months.
Reid says that Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of a election at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in Senat, is convinced that the Presidentship candidate of the Democrats will nominate Hillary Clinton the Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senat have blocked Garlands confirmation since its nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senat Mitch McConnell considers that the next president will declare the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Dr. Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that Clinton expects Garland to choose "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker of Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't care for unruh with a new candidate.
Garland is the top judge for the US Appellation Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination, were Lakaien and Helpers of the Republican Presidentship candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unequivocal to the Presidential office.
Treats wants nacktkalendar for "women and men"
The Treats Magazine is working with the photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970-year-old Pirelli-spired Calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
The head editor of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his Nackt magazine was different from Old School Playboys as "Playboy was for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks it's the Calendar too.
"We need to return to display timeless and classic nakedness, where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these pictures of a female body," said Shaw in a press release to publish the Kalendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally at open Casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality counts with mass flight
"Whoeever does not fit and praise Erdogan, sits on packed bags," says the presidency of the Gulf-nah Foundation Dialog and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany counts short-term with tens of thousands of protective seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
During the medium-term period it could even be "one hundred thousand", the association chairman Ali Toprak believes.
Due to the hard action of Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan after the punch, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"I recognise short-term with tens of thousands, medium-term with some hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime further fights the minorities and democratic opposition," says the association chairman Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government has overlapped Kurdish highburgers with criminal acts for months ago, 50,000 Kurds would be on the escape within Turkey.
After the perpetrated punch, secular and oppositional ethnic doors are still being added.
Many will want to begin in Europe when they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.
"It may not be that a state that itself takes refugees produce refugees in their own country," said Toprak.
The Association Chief accused the targeted attendance of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Algerian cities.
In this way, Erdogan wants to increase the excise pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been evaporated or distributed in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also CDU member.
The CEO called for the Federal Government to position themselves as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its followers.
A "Hexenjagd" was also held in Germany against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel sure in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the wave movement also fears the flight of many doors abroad.
More doors will search asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositional.
The brand marking as a wave followers destroys teachers and other academics the occupational existence.
"Whoeever does not fit up and praise Erdogan, sits on packed bags, on the other hand the Kemalists and Seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, President of the Gulf-nah Foundation Dialogue and Education, the World".
As the newspaper reported on figures of the Federal Ministry of State, the doors have already put the largest group of asylum entitleds recognised for political persecution in Germany before the Putsch.
At the date of 30 June, this was 11.386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all asylum-lawed (39.625).
This survey does not find those fleeing against war, poverty or imperviousness.
Asylum-lawed under the basic law is exclusively political, so by the state side, individually persecuted.
Lower Saxony: "When go, where it hurts"
Seltsame Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals will not get any of the summer winding camp with - and the holidays from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
In 2021 the Country Day election will not take place directly at the end of the summer vacations, the Sister Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year.
For it is not so far that summer festivals, heat and country-day election campaign - that is a bite.
The locals who are supposed to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.
The most popular holidays in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hidden Sea, are not locals, therefore do not have to choose the country day.
This comes to practical problems: In vacations, helpers to hang the posters, blow up airballons, distribute flyers, and counting voices at the end, are only difficult to drive up.
Until September 4th, 2016, the voting and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass the people's election campaign.
The hot phase, if you can say that, just started.
And there is something about: Minister President Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the most powerful party since 1998, is now in surveys clear behind the CDU.
Spaciously, how strong newling is cut off and what remains at the end of coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and government leader since 2008, makes a almost unreasonable election campaign, one looks away from its large sites.
He travels through the country, distributed Rosen and plucks a little with the people, as well as his legendary vocabulary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, soulring has received cold feet and gives Kanzler Merkel the guilty of the AfD’s inheritance.
Their refugee policy, her "We create this" has accelerated the rise of the legal populists, which will probably cost him now.
The CDU with its labels, the Interior Minister Lorenz Cafier, has already experienced how it is to make election campaign at the wrong time.
She has invited two times Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-speak communications; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Sachsen there as Mecklenburgers and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But there is no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU depends largely on the usual election campaigns on market sites and on shopping centers with solar screens and airballons.
That, says Kokert, just play a "subscribe role".
The Union has also noted that it is the basis for her being very strived to find her a wire to the people on the country.
You are like the links, the SPD, the Greens: there is little in the vicinity of the country.
However, the Council of the CDU warrior Kokert to its contestors is also self-declarative: "You must go there, where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
As much is on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly engaged election campaign.
In surveys, social democracies lasted by 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just just before AfD (19).
In 2011 the SPD had won with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, are expected to create the jump in the country's day.
They make a modern virtue from the holiday note and put their election campaign largely into the Internet.
"Online-Wahlkampf", known as the National Chair of Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green election fighters are looking for local voting citizens among the holidays.
Silke Gajek, the Championist, curvt with a house boat through the MeckMecklenburgn lakes and also finds it nice.
Their impression: "Wahlurlaub in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27-saving: Guests suffer under locking
At the speed with which the B 27 is sanized, there is nothing to mecker.
For the responsibilities of the construction work that starts at 5.30 p.m. and only ends at 20 p.m., there is lob.
"They've made everything quite sacky," Elvira Tetzlaf said of the Jet tankstelle.
That's a superteam.
There is no move either.
The construction site could be moved to south at the beginning of the week at the beginning of the mid-term until the end of October everything was supposed to be done.
It is also commended by the recruitment of those responsible for the construction work, such as when it comes to the establishment of aviation.
Since the construction site has been rotated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been resumed and thereby the connection to Rottenburg has been relaxed within the place.
The citizens can now retreat from offerdings from the B 27.
It seems that the back-up traffic by the place goes back.
"There were partially significant complaints," says the Deputy Head of Head of Director Florian King responsible for the transport engineering management.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic laws, because many roads searched and more trusted their navi than the signing.
What led to some trucks in residential areas.
As the speed limits were also not observed, the municipality increased the measuring vehicle from maleges.
"There were significant surprisings," says King, who made himself know about the situation.
There have been two to three in a minute.
The fastest time was 77 km in the tempo-30-zone.
Since the construction site has passed on, it would be more quiet.
For the businesses at B 27 it is just a little comfort that the street is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
You don't like to look into the maps.
But that the B 27-saving has led to turnover breaks, everyone you ask will let it look through.
However, some are more and less affected.
Whoever has to do with the "endour" less, so for other companies, for which the rehabilitation does not have any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest light decline", but also admits that, of course, "the running community is missing".
The most strong belts are locally along the street.
J. Albert Gohnr, holder of the Steakhouse, before Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existing.
It's not only him, but all restaurants have "hearted".
There were no customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Redtweil.
We must be happy about each euro sales.
The revenue incurred is "wide over 50 percent".
The road surgery has thrown his operation back for two years.
He had to leave half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, politics would have responded differently.
Instead, Jörg Schmidt has answered the President of the government on a request from wagers whether there could be a financial compensation, with the note that the restaurant benefits otherwise from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now they must also bear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation.
Solver knows of other districts where such a more generous thing was handled.
With all complaints, wagers are sure that its restaurant will continue to exist.
Finally, the family company has been located here since 1715, refers to the long history.
It can understand that other tribal guests now because of the complex transportation, less frequently overlook it.
If you can't go, it's always beautiful.
The fact that his tribe clints come back after the end of the rehabilitation work, has no doubt about it.
Despite the crisiss with BSE and Birdgrippe, wagers keep the effects of B 27 building work on his team for the largest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in their long-term history.
Six months of construction, that's already brutal.
In the name of terrorism against laws is permanently screwd.
After the recent attacks, the Minister of Interior de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what has a dulding status to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all of this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the loser.
All its proposals are "politically utilized" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of Finance in the concept of his new security package.
You don't need anyone.
Other continuing points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also took part in this.
However, as a minister of Interior, he was located on results and on a "destinable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, the Maizière had passed a little time before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
However, they are now more extensive.
Some are already known, proclaimed, asked: that a new security authority is supposed to care for the knacken of encrypted communication is not new.
Also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU standards on air gas data and weapon law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising as well.
Partly, de Maizière is launching a second approach to proposals that were not made with the SPD: he wants to put the German passage of sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty, and Dschihadists with double citizenship.
"There will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still considers this for a prudent and does not seek anything that has no opportunity at the coalition partner yet.
A few new ideas also present the Maizière.
They have partly in themselves: He plans quick procedures for defenses and more opportunities for arresting people before deciding.
Refugees who are targeted into the country will have to check their smartphones before and open social media accounts for security review.
In the case of dozens for refused asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or discard their papers in order to sleeve their identity.
Some of them are political and legally hurried.
Some are still inevitable and leaves questions open.
And in some points - for example in the unequal treatment of patienced ones - the question is: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says the Maizière that it should be important to differentiate between refugees and terror.
But it is not possible to say that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people worried about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that were most busy by the people did not even get exploded in election wartimes.
The internal security is enormously focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is great.
And yes, there are election fights.
The EU and SPD are therefore increasingly in position in the subject of internal security.
In the past days it was high between the two parties.
First of all, a warrant dispute on the facilities of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of certain EU Ministers, where the Ressort Heads also call for a Burka ban and a return from the double citizenship.
The Maizière also needs to be reconciling sounds here.
He's not going from a double pass.
We have met the discussion in Germany.
They reopen it is not useful.
And with a Burka ban he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional on all corners and whether it is "modifiable" for the coalition partner, it has to be shown.
It's something in it that could take care of dispute.
However, the SPD is currently trying to profile internal safety.
Party Chief Sigmar Gabriel first signals careful conversation willingness and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
People's still looking forward.
Despite diesel channels, delivery numbers are increasing worldwide.
But not in all markets.
In the return action there is a term for whirls.
People's cars are starting in the second half-year delivery of conductors.
Europe's largest car farmer can, despite its many brands and some well-run markets in the previous year, continue to present an Plus.
However, in July, the key brand of VW was weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus refrained the total sale, as the company reported in Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market Germany, delivery was almost a sixth.
The Chief of Markets Jürgen Stackmann took the weaker numbers from July, above all, back to two sales days in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets "changed economic framework conditions" there has been a retainment of purchase.
In addition to the situation around Turkey, the British voting has also been charged for the EU's exit, one spokesman explained.
In the United States, where the excavators first escalated, there is also a minus to be booked.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony continues to be glimpished by the Dieselkandal: After the first seven months, only one delivery minus of 0.9 percent is booked to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group leader Fred Kappler was able to further present a sales budget from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagens this time, globally 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test.
Only in Germany, VW calls about 2.5 million cars to be re-established to the workshops.
As a result of the surcharge, VW confirmed that the transformation of the cars has no negative effects.
No deterioration has been made when the vehicles are relieved when fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power are used.
After surcharging, the carbuilder sets out a "quality guarantee" certificate, but did not speak of a "guaranty", as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
Reasons are legal unity.
The "Focus" reported that folk cars used his German customers now a warranty of crosted diesel models.
This has been confirmed on the last Monday VW representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport was confirmed that there was this meeting.
"WW has to fully comply with the editions of my research Commission and the KBA."
"Deviations are not accepted," said Federal Deputy Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).
VW has assumed the guarantee that, in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power, no deterioration has been carried out after the surcharge, and all type-approval-relevant vehicle values have unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantie" but not as it was called in business circles.
For the far term "guarantie" Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, customers will come to a workshop half a year after the surcharge is about a motor damage - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the interest of the customer to avoid any other damages that have nothing to do with the exhaust channel to a contamination of possible guarantee schemes as it said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantie".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee demands of rich savings in the future as a second institute in Germany.
Bank Chief Joseph Paul said on Thursday, "It's just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily cash accounts".
The German Banken Federal Federation speaks of a single case and does not see the signal: Normal Sparers should "do not fear paying for their saving green penalty".
They must pay 0.4 per cent of penalty overnight at the European Central Bank (EZB).
This fee is required by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September of private and business customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Giro or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs in the future 400 euros in the year," said Paul.
He has been protecting 40 million euros for a period of time, which could be repealed from one day to another and which he could not be worthy.
"They are on my bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the costs," said the bank head.
"I can't lay for every million 000 euros."
It will continue to spend the costs of the causer's principle.
It would be too dangerous for the bank to leave the cash in the banks of Raiffeisen, "I've already experienced four cases, I don't want the fifth!" said the board of the Bank.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other plant forms.
Just a few turned off to other banks.
The Bavaria Society stated: "The extreme monetary policy rate of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks".
It is not possible to wear them alone.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty rates for deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank-Filial 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Head of the Banking Association, said: "We don't expect private customers to pay out surface charges for deposits, with the view that competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and parks."
A banker said that at the Tegernsee there is "a clinic that is something more exhausted from the property".
"This can be the problem for a small bank if she keeps free of charge.
The Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Redtach-Egern, Creuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Bayern community association "is currently not known any other banks that calculate a deposit rate for private customers," said Sprecher Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of the German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had stated in the end of June, "The threshold to go to the negative toward the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is hard, and it threatens the migration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the width.
Destination plates: Who actually buys sound plates?
Lonely men of middle age love plates.
Before you egg to the comment part, to overseal him under the Pseudonym NotAllAtcomeMaandMännerMediterrenAlters with trusted receptions, this statement depends on current data.
According to YouGov, the multituded re-establishment of sound plates is not based on a tree in Millennials that wants to welcome the news of physical objects but due to midlife nostalgy.
Those who have recently bought a plate are all prospects of the age between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.
It is also no hobbysammlers - it has an emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56% for 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% for 66%).
But do you agree with the results of YouGov?
If this blog was a news report in TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a business street in Soho, wear a moderate grey attraction and wild stouling before I standing, keep my hands and say something surpassing like: "So, let us throw a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look on it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part where I was directly close to various men in such shops and try to rate their age and mind by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow by Sister Ray (Data number: two young women, three men middle age) to Reckless Records (Data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is one day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, do I ask?
"I appreciate," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These sound plates, trained above (he sent me the snap committee via e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when it appeared and buy new items he sold when he was young and pleaded.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably something too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather inverted and like to spend time alone and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my loadr.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets meet on the YouGov profile.
But he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hip, people who have heard about the comeback and are able to see their old records again.
From the discussions I have conducted, people usually have unfolded their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy themselves their records again," he says.
This would explain the tree to followers of the plate revival of a particular age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that plate shops offer a calm community of equal families.
According to Wez, some of the older customers attacked the contactless payment system.
Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted sound plates, from objects that wake happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a empty one or the possession of material owners as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's like a collector with me, and I think it's like many people.
It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" a employee fled out from a plate stack.
A survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a plate last month have not yet heard them.
The survey also found that 41% have a plate player that they never use, while 7% of those buying a plate do not have a plate player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while leaking through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Data number: three men middle ages), has noticed a "tropheenaspect" of the Revival.
"Jemand came here just recently and said: "I don't own plate player, but I would like to buy a radio head sound plate so I can put it into the Regal," he says.
This is not a large percentage but it definitely happens.
More product-lasty, less musical.
We have people who say, "I have no plate player."
These are younger people, not older ones who are slowly coming in.
Fopp, who dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a bubble audience when I enter.
There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage youths and women middle ages.
Even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast’s latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz out of the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity with the customers.
No one of them looks very lonely, but nightly psychic dreamatas are hard to fix when you are standing next to one 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of the records that are for sale.
She's making a shower bummel rather than a big shopping.
It doesn't deserve much, so the collection of plates is no real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives off with a lover seufzer.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last hold is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm giving the seem to have the Jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenagers who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley plate player.
To link is a staircase house, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for a average collection.
No one looks at her - perhaps because they are merely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "platt art".
But in view of the fact that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the deep sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one who spends most for luxury subjects like plates.
Even if my research revealed that YouGov's results agree, at least in plate shops in Soho, they are unreasonable to the large number of female collectors and plate lovers who exist in reality, plate shops and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They don't spend their Thursday morning with the bummeling by plate shops of the Berwick Street and the leave through plates, while they avoid the starving view of an incredible 30-year wrong moderator, who doesn't surround any unprecedented men in the middle of age.
The Greenlandhai is the longest liver - video report
Scientists say that the Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all the whirls on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, the Haie studied, says that the record was at a female, from which it is assumed that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to defeat thousands of provisoric shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court negotiations this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be powered to deposit 72 provisoric shops in which people in the warehouse were able to sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer Friseur services, or tea for 50 Cent (40 Pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisoric restaurants.
The Prefecture of Calai argued that these places should be deteriorated because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that are a fire and sanity risk.
Humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the stately supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also found that provisoric shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the interpretation of people who operate the 72 provisoric businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "definitely compellable."
The Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions.
He said that the areas offer quiet hits between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the villages was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is being operated in common and offers 200 meals on the day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of protective minors in stock.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to maintain the children's café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closing would be "for these children of a disaster that are the latest eight years of age."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9.00 people - the highest number up to now - after a split increase in new propulsions during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olimpian period, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be undergoing.
"I continue to keep the WM in my view, remain confident and fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He does not have a statement for his horrific twelve place at the sugar hat.
"I think it is honestly difficult to comment on yesterday's journey," said Martin.
He had to analyse in peace what reasons had led to debakel.
In October, Martin wanted to fight the title at the time-treat World Cup in Qatar.
"I'll see everything that we've changed last time."
"This is my position too", wrote the three-time world champion who had lost Olympiaseger Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on 54.5 km more than three minutes.
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund misss halffinals
Laura Siegemund's victory ended in Rio's Quarterfinals: The world rankings-32. from messengers missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semifinal of the Olimpian tennisturnier clearly.
Shechemund, which was plagued by back problems, had only been able to pass its retention once and acted without power in comparison to the previous rounds.
On Thursday there was still medal hope of Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) the chance of jumping into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open Adviser met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis profi, Tommy Haas had collected a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.

Groups increase at start-up for live video play transfers
Other people look at video games is a giant trend - Microsoft wants to benefit from it too.
The technology group buys the start-up beam specialized on this hobby.
How much money for the acquisition flows, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer until January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can look at others when playing, but also enter themselves.
For example, they can give up missions to players and face enemies and provide equipment.
The Playerian Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the treeing world of the e-sport.
The way to the global media event is to help Facebook.
The advertising industry is already horrific.
The employees of the start-up, which has its seat in Seattle in the state of Washington, move to the Microsoft headquarters in the Kalibern Redmond, as Beam co-founds and Chef Matt Salsamendi shared.
There is no change for the customers to do so through the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, it is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video play activities is currently growing rasant.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by the online dealer Amazon in 2014 - for almost one billion dollar.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother alphabet.
Here comes the force trailer.
Germany's Raser has to focus on the next generation of speed measurings: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning equipment will be tested that should be particularly effective.
The futuristic enforcement trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used for accidents where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measuring by the police.
For example, autobahn construction stations or to reduce bridges with temporarily temporarily limit are often no necessary infrastructure in order to ensure that the speed limit is met with an stationary lighter.
A permanent mobile building may be too dangerous or excessive.
The enforcement trailer is autark: His battery holds five days in unbroken measurement operation, the fall data are transmitted via a modem.
At the same time, laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be recorded over several tracks.
Variable speed limits and transit bans can also be monitored according to time, bicycles and vehicle classes.
In the high-performance state, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with an appendix.
In order not to simply be clothed, it is reduced in the measuring business, so the wheels disappear in the panted and, on the other hand, also safe outdoor pillows.
In addition, an built-in alarm system is intended to protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer is tested and now also used by Vitronic, according to information from Vitronic.
Also, foreign authorities flash with the new technology: Jüngst has ordered 100 pieces after ordering 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain fetchs silver in 7- Rugby after Fiji Masterclass holes gold
Britain's impressive performance at the 7th Rugby came at the final on Thursday evening to a abrupt hold at the last horde in the form of Fiji, when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, trucks, line loop and red power to win gold - their first olympia medal any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad comfort price of silver medals - Britain's fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa.
The clear precipitation of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could fall to them in the finale.
But, independently, Fiji had put a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind him.
She lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens eight years ago.
Here they lost only one.
This lock will be wounded, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started surprising and left the attacks of Spass.
It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and co. as if you were running in driving buses. The World Series poets went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau roasted in the corner.
With four minutes of time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he changed.
12-0 and GB has hardly picked up the ball.
A magnificent bag of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new since the re-apply and there was still more than a minute of time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravou presiding by further weak branches of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought one 29-0 to the break.
It is like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's what it is.
GB passed fundamental changes to half-time and closed the Finian lying... for all four minutes, what was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had been for long for the South Sea islands, whose fans sang, swallowed flags and danced on the tribone.
It was not difficult to admire the playeric approach to Fijis.
Mata Viliame put the i-tuble with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pfiff found that Fijis embraced, and GB knocked devastatingly in the rass.
Earlier on the day, Fiji had violated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5, and Britain urged South Africa to be a small half-final measuring from race - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton breaked through the line with an impressive footwork and reached a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the trainer's cancer for rudersieg
There will be no emotinarian gold than with these games and that wants something.
From the first rowing strike to the last, 220 hardheaven who enter the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if there were only the two who sat on the rod, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all the time when they were the second olympiagolf in the two without tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports that lay such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, at least her 39th inevitable use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletines that sleeve over the surface with the elegance of pigs, which does not reflect the kind of triumphe to dancing.
Behind every gold in the Ruder, a Bataillon is placed on willing helpers who contribute to the progressive progress that makes the difference and it was no one helper than the trainer who did not know whether he would survive this day at all than was diagnosticed with him.
He said he was a risky one.
I had bubble cancer that is operaable and that they did.
If you don't do that, he's spreading out everywhere.
It would have been a very bad situation.
It changes a little of the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio had lucky that he was treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could begin what the interruption was kept at a minimum if that is at all the correct term under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked at the station - 20 foot, 30 foot, 50 foot at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.
That's how it starts.
It's a challenge already being challenging, but that makes it even greater.
In the indispensability of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning something more than otherwise and tried to handle his own fears.
Stanning, who was a chief man in the Royal Artillery regime in an operation in Afghanistan, said "I was a emotional wreck this week. It may be an extreme thing, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much this means how much I and Helen and Robin worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be nobody, so a great thanks to him, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have a better person to train or wish a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost races over the past five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents couldn't hold.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams started off from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "keep in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't have to do something great.
We did not want a firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go beyond and win what we did.
The pair will take up a period of time for a year before it will take decisions on his future.
Glover needs to appear on a wedding next week, their own with the TV advent Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I'm an Olympician.
It was all so new for me, and I was so disturbed.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of example provided for clarity
The Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitenstein Group", Ruppert Göller, goes in rest.
The association is considered to be "for example".
A small French drinking water organisation as a example for the large water producers.
Thus it was some time ago in the original tone in a contribution from the Bavarian broadcast.
The waterforum of the Government of Understandings became worthy of the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group called "bayern wide as example".
After all that, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the purpose association, of which 28 years as manager of the business.
Now he was adopted in rest at the age of 65.
The Veitenstein group's drinking water organisation, seat in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and a Weiler with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach City.
For other cities and communities there are water delivery contracts.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Goölr was set up as a waterwave in 1985 and has already been appointed in 1988 as the Executive Director of the Purpose Association.
"The tasks of its tasks have been very varied, and they extended from the water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency revenues in weekends," said the chairman.
As an outstanding event, it called the establishment and destruction of the new fountains (1994), ground-pieces in the field of new fountains (1998) and compensation of farmers, the rehabilitation of high tanks (1999), the renovation of central computer control (2004) and the sub-renewments of water pipes.
There has not been any silence and you have always taken new changes because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
She praised faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years in her Laudatio.
He has worked with a lot of heartblood for his water purpose association and has lived the water purpose association regularly as if it would be his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction before the waterforum of the district.
He has received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller on the other hand praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water guard and he was a faithful boy.
Together, we were an unsatisfactory team.
As a highlight of his view, he referred to the construction of the fountain and the reconstruction of the purpose association.
The greatest challenge and most difficult use were, however, the pipe break on the high container at Kirchlauter on a 3nd January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees the whole night will have to work through, so that localities could be provided with water.
Even the supply of neubruns can only be maintained because you filled the high truck from Pettstadt with sleeves.
The management of the drinking water target association was transferred to Daniel Storms from Lauter, which attracts the follow-up of Rupert Goölr.
Sopranist Anna Netrebko goes openly with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognized with her son, she believed that she had to die.
In the meantime, the eight-year-old Tiago was well coming forward and now learn privately in New York, where it is the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that's two years back when I sang at the Mailänder Scala, he remembered nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the most happy man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection to Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relation State in Barelines - Man shoots on Living Assistant
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 p.m. in a multifamily house in Bargteheite (Creis Stormarn) and injured her death.
"The man himself called with us and indicated to have shot his spouse," said a police speaker.
The perpetrator is on the escape, after him is flocked publicly.
Meanwhile, Sven S. could be on the road with the car.
The man is about 1.80 meters large, muscular, browned and has a glass.
In the meantime, the police published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a glaze.
The man is not supposed to be addressed directly.
He could wear the gun, so the police.
Whoever Sven S. sees, should call the 110.
The police speak of a "reference state".
The victim was the year 1988, the deceaser 1981.
At first, the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the act or the relationship between deceasants and victims; but it confirmed that a human being had been killed.
"It's a delusion delicate."
"We don't say yet," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special intake command (SEK) was at the place of action.
Steel - View for German steel industry
The crying-bounded and energy-intensive German steel industry is discharged from additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens threatened by the industry from the eco-stream threat are from the table.
It remains in the liberation of the renewable energy environment in the stocks for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the 'West German General Zeitung' (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore planned to request the steel producers to use gases from the high oven for electricity production for their own consumption.
According to the German industry, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel said the WAZ that there is now a principle of agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, a EEC environment of 20 percent falls.
However, these are not collected in the steel industry.
The IG metal welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on the production of own electricity.
The Quo status of the previous regulation is largely defined.
The successful efforts of Gabriel to the steel industry have been particularly important.
"For our campaign 'Steel is future', this is a first step."
"Money must follow."
"According to the reform of emission rights, climate and employment targets are considered," said IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered under overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation was further intensifying than the world's largest producer country of China in view of the weakening home demand of mass steel on the world market.
European producers present price dumping by Chinese steel companies.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed.
For one thing, import duties are related to the effect of import steel, and, on the other, the economic perspectives in China have clarified.
I don't know how persistent the price recovery is.
The German Branchenprimus Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Recently, the prices would have been rather stagnated.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not have to exclude closings of individual works in the last place.
In the German steel industry, around 86 000 people were busy in the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders.
They produced with 3.4 million tonnes of raw steel less than in the previous month, as the production of steel was reported on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the volume produced now returned the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production is less than two percent of the previous year.
The association is calculated in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing exhaust.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singen do Senioren good
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp's whole life: As a young girl, she was in the school chor, in the educational and educational school, she was doing music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a Senior core.
"Sing moves me - emotional and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, happy and more alive, she says.
She is also doing something good with her health and her spirit.
Because singing is equal to several perspectives a great hobby for Seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.
Most of the Seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music, describe Hackler.
The regular cohesion allows Senioren to link and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures are solved by age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "See up and organize, rely on the others and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of cohesion."
singing can be stressing in a positive sense, Hackler says.
Because of this, Senioren train a deep and controlled breath.
Those who regularly demand his lungs do not take up so fast in everyday life.
Even if it is about receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.
In the case of older people, singers often have a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Community of the Senioren Organizations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it was part of the everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes the singing or hearing of songs in elderly people abundant memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.
By songs and especially melodies, self-despaired people are disappointing on long-reaching events.
In singing, the head is also demanded a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time concentrate on your own voice and on a particular rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that is a big cognitive challenge.
Just elderly people who live alone are exercising not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition of singing in the choir, Hackler.
A excited audience is a great praise.
Self-value feeling also grows by singing in the choir.
Show yourself: If I practice long for something, I will be better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.
Good reasons to start singing, so there's enough.
Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent, counsel Lenz.
You are not singing alone - at 50 singing people, who will hear when a sound goes?
At the search for the appropriate offer, Senioren have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone sings from the renowned circle in a senior chor, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews about the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can turn directly to the municipality or the Chief of the Church.
You can also find many senior chores via the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the Internet search.
Those who like to sing should join a choir, counsel Hackler.
singing does the soul good and has something free - that is true of every age.
Cats respond more sensitive than cats to crying the virgins
Biologists have studied in Hannover the effect of calling catbabys on adult animals.
To her surprise, the miauen did not make the males cold, but they always maintained the same in the difference with the females.
Female cats can detect the excitement of catenbabys at the miauen of the little ones.
They respond by ten percent faster to sounds of caestics who know in great need how scientists found from veterinary universities and the Medical University Hannover (MHH).
Although Kater also responds to the calls of cakes - but always equal.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the miuen are less and strongly right virgins for males either not perceptible or not of significance," said Biologin Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
It is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the research team had already discovered that the duration and sound height of the caestic screw were different from the urgency of their need for assistance.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cakes were observed from the animal maintenance of the MHH.
They were played for a call of little ones who were taken out of the worfbox for three minutes and separated from mother and sisters.
On the other hand, they were faced with shouts of stronger right cakes, which were additionally raised.
The researchers believe their results despite the low sample.
"All females, even those who had no own adults, responded differently to the cry," conerding said.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call played the far more privileged cakes.
This ability may be inborn or developed with the sex maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have responded at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby tastes in human terms.
In addition, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to nurses, regardless of whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski grabs "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükort is a soccer lying in Turkey.
In Turkey a warrant order has been adopted against the once football star Hakan Sü short.
He's being a member of a terrorist group.
Firstly after the punch test, a key football game will take place in Turkey again.
Before the show of the Erzrivalen between Besiktas Istanbul and Luke Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual".
In the case of the exceptional state after the attempt to retreat in July, the government would not be affected by the everyday of normal citizens.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the Teacher Fethullah waves that are responsible for the supplication.
There is no stop before the soccer is made.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sü short, the prosecutor was a warrant.
So, now living in America, the succumbs will be a member of a terrorist group.
It is intended to be the supporter of the Preacher Fethullah Güls, responsible by the President of the State Representative Tayip Erdogan.
Although, firstly, the exceptional state depended for 90 days still until October, it actually has the effect on the life of most doors but not on any effect.
The nightly "democracy-wache" on public places throughout the country has completed Erdogan for Wednesday.
Sports is - like the whole country - divided into followers and opponents of Erdogans.
Especially fans of the Worker Club Besiktas are not among the president's friends traditionally.
However, in view of dramatic experiences in history, the strict rejection of militaryputs is the case.
There are even the fans agree - no matter whether their hearts hit Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the case of Pokalsieger "Gala" it will be possible to come back to Luke Podolski.
The Cologne found his sports value in the expiry season: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31 year old ended his first time as a top scorer of his association.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he reached the 1:0-seaver.
The newspaper "Fanatic" jumped him, "He was the best at the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the Pocal.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record master found a versatile conclusion.
After the Vorrund-K.o in the Champions League, the "Löwen" also varies early in the Europe League.
In the Süper Lig, it was only enough for ranking six.
The season wasn't good.
The Pocal was the only way to win something.
"We have done that and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the year of the game was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who set the basis for the 14th title with 26 saucers as a Süper-Lig Championshipper.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope on the return of the 31-year-old.
The Gomez, which was authorised by the AC Florence under contract, had announced only by the punch test that the political situation in the country did not return to its EM faith.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the magazine "Kicker" Club head Fikret Orman.
However, the storm should be ready to stop by about one third of its annual salary estimated to 7,5 million euros, Orman stated: "We cannot pay his salary for Florence."
Despite doping: These atlets still have medaills-Chancen at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin had been locked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa cannot start in Rio.
Others transmitted Leichtathletic Sons can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic Doping still determines the headlines of the Olympics in Rio.
The Russian swimer Julija Jefimowa, who had invoked her initial right shortly before the games, was chined and exhausted at their start (100 meters of breast).
It was a shurrile scene: With a smile that she was still provoked into the hall and provoked with her appearance.
When she was not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a jealous tower.
But there are still many more sporters who start the start of the Olympics in Rio despite doping.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-statue/USA): The 34-year-old belongs to the most controversial figures in lightathletics.
He had been locked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his bann, the Olympician of 2004 and ex-world champion even faster than before, he is the number one in 9.80 seconds in the world and is considered the largest inquiry of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price (100, 4x100-m-staffel/Jamaika): The two-time Olympician and seven-fold World Championshipperson had to take a six-month lock after she was shown to take the oxycodon pain.
After a operation, she had strong tooth pain, the 29-year-old defended.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatia): 2011 Olympiacist of 2012, World Championshiper of 2013 and European Championist from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively on the prohibited stimulans medium methylhexanamine.
Perkovic was investigating the renowned intake and was locked six months.
The four most widest drips this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel/USA): Peking olympicizer and twice World Championshipper over 400 m, was tested positively in 2010 and was locked 21 months.
A penis enlargement funds were responsible, prayed to Merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 metres of the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Well, little athlete has been known as many medals.
Thus, Tichon lost his WM title of 2005 nine years later after testosteron doping was detected at him.
The 40-year-old also had to give olympia-Silber 2004 because of steroid dopings and EM-Title 2006 because of testosterone abuse.
The also known bronze medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 was returned to CAS due to a judgment by the International Sports Court.
With 80,04 m, he is on Rank two of the world ranking list.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world recorder and Goldfavoritin were tested only in May but may start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old World Championship, evidence of the adoption of a forbidden food supplement was found, the locking of the World-Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell out mildly and was already expired on 13 July.
bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - multiple dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Fridayfresh.
They have suffered cut wounds and were treated in the hospital, but this has already been able to leave.
Her home trip planned it for the beginning of September.
Either more explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, Austrian citizens are still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, says Schnöll.
In the about 200 kilometers south of the capital of Bangkok, Hua Hin were exploded first on Thursday evening in an outgoing quarter of two bombs.
According to the police, a Thai country had been killed and about 20 people were injured, including Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday, two rates of speech went up again and a further person was killed according to the authorities.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion early.
A taxi driver was injured after police details near the holidays popular bathing beach Patong.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, a further bomb exploded, who killed a city officer.
According to the authorities in a flower beet before the coastal police district, the fragrance was in the air.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang were demanding several injuries on the Southwest coast and Chumphon on the Southeast coast.
They have been related to the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombers have the same handwriting," said Armegeneral Danai Kritmethavee Fridayfresh before journalists.
"We expect it to be a coordinated attack."
It's too early to speak about possible motifs - but probably it's about the deeds of Muslim rebels.
In the case of the attacks, Thai media also wanted to detect a pattern typical for the bombenattates of Muslim separationists in the southern part of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police stated that the attacks were not related to Islamist opposition movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which restricts itself to limited areas and provinces," said one speaker in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the dominant military junta.
In recent days, the authorities would have received mystery indications of the abovementioned attacks in the southern part of the country, but they would not have been informed about the exact date and locations.
It's still unclear that group was behind the attacks.
The police addressed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and recreational districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks, but mostly they do not fight tourists.
In Hua Hin, a palace was used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
The Austrian Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends, following the current bomb explosions, to give the instructions of the Thai Security Authorities absolutely.
High security risk (security level 3) for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
Following conflicts between security forces and Muslim population parts, no need to travel to these provinces will be abolished.
Increased security risk (security level 2) paid for the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This also brings great influence to the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and President-in-Office Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to stimulate Chaos, while the country is moving towards stability, improving economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrests, keeps itself beneficial to restore the Kingdom to stability and order.
However, the military has not been able to handle the surprising rebellions in the extreme south of the country for years.
The conflict has already killed more than 6500 people.
A few years ago, in Bangkok, 20 people had been killed in an attack on a popular Hindu sculptor - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodyst attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "Identitious Movement" has been found in the Visor of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office.
According to several national officials, the constitutional protectors in the covenant also observed the group.
"We see in the 'Identitarian movement' signing points for striving against the freedomful democratic basic regulation," said Constitutional Protection Chief Hans-Georg Maaßen der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Thus, immigrationers of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diminished in extremistic manner.
That's why we also observe the movement.
The "Identitary Movement" is a group of French roots active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multiculty-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "the loss of their own identity through alienation".
Constitutional guardians in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Sachsen and Thüringen - already watch the "Identials".
Maaßen said that his authority had closely voted closely with the national officials in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Idential Move' try to get her target group where she stands," said the Constitutional Protection Chief.
Generally, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
It does Islamists as well as legal exremists.
This is not a fair advertising for the own thing.
The propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly attacked.
That's dangerous.
Recently there were reports on contacts of the "Idential" to AfD politicians from several states.
Maaßen said he has no knowledge.
Any possible contact of this kind is relevant for the Constitutional Protection only from a certain point of view.
It is about whether the party concerned - in this case the AfD - is changing their target direction by certain persons who are extremist, and so extremist.
It is therefore important to whether such persons have taxing influence on the party.
This is not recognized.
With a view to the clear increase in law-based crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak about new right terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be legal terroristic structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the volunteer group.
It may be true that further legal terrorist groups or smallest groups are designed to plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other legal extremist motifs.
However, a German or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognized.
The previous groups were created at regional level or in social networks.
Be cared about the fact that many violations went to the account of people who had previously not been in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the act suspects in attacks on asylums have not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or followers of the right scene.
"Many people have thus committed crimes that had not yet been on the hut before with legal ekremists, which may have been politically indifferent or, for example, have chosen CDU, SPD or links, which have then radicalised themselves by legal exremist mood".
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internet hit
Not always determine the olympionics or world records the headlines at the Olympics.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimming pool from Ethiopia swim so slowly that he wasn't in the TV pictures anymore.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In social networks, Habte became a viral internet heat.
In fact, the 24-year-old with a retreat of 48 seconds finished his front and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not just sporty figure, which draws attention to international media.
Why does the 24-year-old take part in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopier received a special start law from the international swimming party.
This is distributed to make swimming known in under-represented countries.
Since in Ethiopia most sportsmen run, just wanted to make something different.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the rounds.
Some media called him as "Robel of the wha".
The English boulevard "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun about him.
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, there was no role.
Compare with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the Olympics 2000 in Sydney, the course of Eric Moussambani cared for medial attention.
Unforgettablely, the appearance of the swimming forcer from Equatorial Guinea was when he had to come in a front of over 100 meters of free style alone.
Moussambani was fired at that time.
The 22-year-old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never lost a long distance before the competition.

According to the police, the 67-year-old secretary had left their business on Monday by 17.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
The next morning, when she returned to 8.15 p.m., the cash had disappeared about 250 euros.
No traces of the dadder could be found.
Video monitoring is not also present.
Trump does not look so close to the threatening defence
The Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a election campaign event in Florida.
If there is nothing with the choice to the US President, Donald Trump has already an alternative idea.
He's going to get to vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US Presidency elections in November, he would be relatively unnecessary: "Lastly it will either fold, or I have a very beautiful, long vacation," said the candidate of the Republicans in a telephone interview with the US TV CNBC.
If it was not rich for him for reasons of political correction, it is okay, Trump said.
So he called the U.S. President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Terrormiliz Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistant.
Post increases in trade with electrical transporters
An electrical vehicle of the German post in action.
The interest of other companies in the companion is apparently large.
The post plans to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
In short, the group wants to start trading with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters in the next year also on the free car market.
"We want to get into sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
Since months, the company has been checking whether they should sell their self-developed StreetScooter with which letters and packages are delivered, also to other companies.
Post Board Jürgen Gerdes said that there were always demands, such as managing.
After information from the news magazine "The mirror" the Bonn Group wants to get into the mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In the rising factory, the company plans to build up to 100,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to increase its fleet of electric cars clearly and peils for long-term a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will make a very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we transform the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany’s streets since 2014.
GfK Executive shall take place after disappointing business payments
The consumer research company GfK exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
Although the retreats came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK made it clear that the Chair of Board Chief Matthias Hartmann becomes more uncertain, the longer the successes promised by him.
Turbulenzen at the top of the GfK Market Research Company Nürnberg: After retusing business payments and the return of the management of the company, the Five of the Branch is before a personal re-start.
GfK Board Chief wants to leave the company for the end.
The Chair of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert already decides from the Supervisory Board on 12 September.
The board of the Board has already taken over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, who shared the company on 1 September.
He should officially accept the function of a Board speaker until a successor was found for Hartmann.
As a result of the withdrawal, the company called "subsidious views" for the long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to mention a company speaker on Friday.
Those who are going to lead the market research company are still unclear.
In investors, on Friday it was said that the shareholders had last been disappointed by the continued successes of the herstructurering initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK tip since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are still not to be seen after 5 years," said it.
In view of the latest poor GfK business numbers, each shareholder will be disrupted at any time.
"If this was the case with BMW, the quantitatives would also be like this," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss in the previous quarter of 2016 after repayments in the prequarters.
With 361.2 million euros, the sales rate was 6.1% lower than the level of the comparable previous quarter.
In relation to the first half of the year, sales increased by 3.4% by 721.2 million euros.
The second quarter profits have, above all, burdened the reduced value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company value depreciation of 139 million euros in the Consumer Experience business has been necessary to damage the group a loss of 148.2 million euros under the line.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had a group profit of 19.7 million.
Casualties - Buses are exposed in crystals in graves: Eight injureds
At an accident of a trip bus with 43 passengers as passengers, eight people have been injured on Thursday in herds (Aurich Landkreis).
Two of the inmates suffered severe injuries, the police shared.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to wipe her data because of an encountered load that was partly on the tramway.
The bus came right from the street and slipped into a grave, as a speaker reported the Aurich/Wittmund Police.
"Due to the situation of the bus, people couldn't leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire war saved the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a emergency car came to the accident site on the national road 2.
The inevitable travelers were brought back from a line bus to the Mummer's district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
The mediators urged the rider and possible Witnesses to report at the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water shall be charged from 1 October 2016 for the field of wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welt cahl 3.44 instead of EUR 2.10; for Tartenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euro (up to €2.26) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euros (up to €2.18).
The Azendorf plant will increase the wastewater fee at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After a surprising calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
According to Mayor Bernd Steinhaus (CSU), the budget was approved by the Board of Land Kulmbach that underdecks for these wastewater plants.
On the basis of legal basis, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants costly.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens and the business and industrial businesses from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take more deep into the money bag.
The increases in fees are between 48 and 67 percent.
As director Herbert Schmidt revealed the body, a new calculation of fees was necessary for the wastewater plants of the market community.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, under-declarations from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The graving fee increases founded Schmidt to deal with all three wastewater plants with relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater accident between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
As a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be seriously affected.
In addition, the water supply in all three plants would be slightly low.
In addition, in the falling period of calculation, all three plants have not last been affected in a significant scale due to their age of rehabilitation and repair.
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that Azendorf had to exchange the mechanical ventilation system due to damage.
In the Pumpwork Welschenkahl, the nearly 20-year-old funding facilities had to be overreached and the pond clarifying system had to be extracted after nearly 20 years of operation of the first clarity, disposed of clarity and built an additional ventilation potential to maintain the water legal standards in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses, the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account in accordance with the new calculation period."
The same applies to current cost of electricity, which was still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stein houses made it clear that, in the case of the small wastewater attack in the three plants, the expenditure for the operation and maintenance "perfectly strike".
In addition, Schmidt added to the market community of large entertainment costs for wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for the plants mentioned will continue to remain precarious, especially the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Friesenbachtal Association could not be extended to these plants because it is defizitary facilities.
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first more than zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (Juli 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 -0.2%.
In July 2016 a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); different goods and services (0.3%).
The prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile, budget equipment and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
The prices remained as in the premature of alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education were unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspirated, but some observers say that it is inferibel to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in such a way that is already limited to the surgery.
You can turn into an ananas, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lightenstein paintings.
The filters are unfolded, proprietary tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All defects have come to the public.
Snapchat filters have criticized in the past, in which they were accused that the App Blackface would promote more or white skin as beautysideal.
When there were some users this week a filter for them that had slashs, false teeth, and strokes, some critics called a racist caravan of Asians - "great view".
They asked whether these repeated conflicts pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.
The news and polluting were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat informed that it would have deactivated the feature.
The company offered an excuse: The filter was thought as a hommage on Anime-Charaktere and not as a caravan by Asians.
But outside, who have experienced Rassissmus, the filter reminded of harmful clishes.
Others decided to refuse the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose second was widespread about the photos that the filter was "injured and leaned" was unpleasant.
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the counterover of a very contradictive Asian mapping and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow view was drawn into the devaluating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.
The American culture seems to be developed in an endless diversity and integration campaign, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - which are in matters of race more different than their older players - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is insulting for a user, "so it's much more difficult that such things remain unmarked than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in a interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their snapchat account called others to do the same.
In a record for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that they believe that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in attitude practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the white, only male leadership and finished her record with a Hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"And they do not have a variety of representatives of people with other skin colours in their proof, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours working there but are not in positions where they feel safe or well to say what is about."
Others share their opinion, a complaint which has left Snapchat mostly unresponsibly.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its evidence and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a speaker, the company has recently set up a personnel responsible, who concentrates on under-represented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, on the other hand, that she will close her snapchat account and added, "I wonder if she need more users than us to say that this is not O.K.."
Military management of ISIS Secretary Service Information, sets out Committee of the Congress
Military representatives of the United States Central Command changed procurement service information to draw a more optimistic picture of war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the actual conditions locally, reported an investigation committee of the convention in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, created by a task force of republican members of the military committee, secret service committee and the Ruhrbodgetkommit, reports of great discomfort among Central Command Secretary Service Analytics who reported how suspects changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military mainquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information, which was typically sent by high-level centcom Communists, was regularly a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than that of the actual conditions on site and was more common than an analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened to Centcom is inadequate - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republikans member of the Representative House.
The management error in the centcom reaches the top peak of the organization.
The 10-page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in training the Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication of the fact that government tips under Obama have been instructed to change the reports, it shows how analytics viewed the pressure of their prewets to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"With the first half of 2015, many central commands were significantly positive in press releases, opinions and statements before the convention than in the facts," the report stated.
For example, a Centcom family member publicly announced that a military backover of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigations, it's so clear." said Mike Pompeo, republic congress officers from Kansas, in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the peaks of the Central Command changed the post-direction service reports to reduce the danger by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force after they had been played that analytics were worried about the manipation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigations are continued.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are carried out by the Minister of Defence.
Democratic members of the news service committee published their own knowledge on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republic Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of verification services to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest level of democrat in the Commission, member of the representative house Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.
This process, said Mr. Schiff, "doubled the publication of postponement reports," damaged the morality under analytics and "have overly little space for different opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said that they could not have found any incidence of the White House at the Centcom Analysten as regards a "decisive political opinion".
The provisional results of the investigations of the convention were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported of investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which was taken after complaints by Centcom Analysten.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press speaker, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the convention while the investigations of the General Inspector were still in progress.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have very divergent opinions regarding interpretation have complex data and that news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the accusations of the past year have raised the question how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State remembers difficulties over more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush was against the recommendations of many analytics only a small crew in Iraq and little time went on to make thought of the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in rescuing the current reporting about the Islamic state.
Last year, Mr Hooker’s team, according to government authorities, notes that, against the statements of the Government, air attacks against the Raffineria held by the Islamic State, had no significant impact on the financial situation of the Terrorist Group, since these provisoric refiners had taken operation in order to sell oil on the black market.
This knowledge was not published, however, reported the Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to rest in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States win fourth Match in the fieldhockey of women, a showdown with Britain stands before
One day after she had shot three gates over Japan during a six-1 victory, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American fieldhockey team of women in a Match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five gates in two games should actually represent a thoughtful performance, but Bam (27) said that she couldn't remember having ever done it.
"I have no idea." she said.
I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.
They know, however, that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olimpian competition and are at the same time in their group with the Britains on the first place that remains unattended after their 2-0 win against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet each other on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinal, the game will decide which of the two will get the first and the second place within their group of six teams.
The first placed will go out the strong Holanians for a little longer to the other group.
However the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirl, four years after they landed on the last of 12 places during the past London games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time in three years a hockey hit in hands (the two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), with 16 years, she became a national player of the United States, the latest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympiade in 2008, as she couldn't qualify for the frame.
Then the year 2012, where she and her team were shiftling everything.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an English, trainer of the national team, began to turn things to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the job break in London that we have now.
We could've run the row completely around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the towers in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close area.
India went into the game without victory, but the team showed herself surprisingly and held the stand of the game from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into her hands.
She executed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flanke, then moved to the middle and jumped the ball to the gate to provide a 2-0 lead to the Americans.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a walk.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the Rage of Olympics, the Cen of Trampoline
Wherever you are, as late as it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel persistent and unsatisfactory, a rising race between competition and striving.
It is like the Olympics Fackel itself would be a burning stab that is enough from the armbrust protection to the swimming to the tower to the triathlete.
You can't activate the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the Coffeshop's waitinglange without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is the first time in the Olympic Games and is a female swarm with grubs, could be among these well-known names that are sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-fühl TV turmoil if he was a swimming, tower, or even feather.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Trampolineturns.
The olympic flames do not illuminate any event.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports types that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, bow shooting, bathminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the breast swim and we can do it for a long time.
But if I may make modest arguments for my particular favorite, let me focus on the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jumping has already been an olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparrowed that many who had asked me did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent atlets to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and had an atlet that has made it up to the end round until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outdoor charm, partially because it sounds more suitable for a clown school than that for the Olympics.
In this place, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous citasters of his never ends willing excitement - but also the grey of turning and diving, the two sports that combine it essentially.
The word "Tramolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "sprung board."
Attending winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to run a number of falling movements (rots, heats and saltos) before they land on the feet.
They are assessed according to official Olympia programme after execution, difficulty and flight time.
Twenty-third athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will come against each other in Rio.
The most common olympic vector is right away.
Medaillen hopende must continue in their pursuit to gold, faster, move up and over, sometimes to the target, sometimes down and back, go up and down on the playground.
They are not only hunting the target line or the starting wall, but also a further höhin target in television: the world or the Olympia record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatically - and it is enough to bring even a viewer to tears.
But it is also what I feel very tired when I see these games.
The trampoline offers an atempause.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is top.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she prals off, seemingly hardly like an astronaut, goes up, then move down, then hardly up again.
There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant withdrawal of time and difficulty.
It's just like the competition in the Olympics can be.
The women's skills and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, at Streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00 p.m.
NBC will exhibit the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.
If the consciousness increase only can be achieved by the application and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. tournament according to the The Wall Street Journal recently - Mr. Dooley expects his new catching end after air.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a United States bonder
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demons, which demanded political changes in Ethiopia, were of the government's violent resistance.
Witnesses say that during the collapse with the police, zig prosecutors were killed in the case of shoes.
Is Ethiopia just breaking together?
In the past decade it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid tieder of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stimulated on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's answer was inadequate according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses indicated that police were shot and killed onty unarmed demons.
In turn, videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people strike young people with stocks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The Chief of the UN Human Rights Authority will now require an incoming investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Masjid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the west.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist dangers beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if any, receive such many Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded in remarkable temporarily.
His infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new pendler move in the capital of Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was not a model of democracy - human rights organisations have continued to be persuaded by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted and dissidents were effectively brought to silence.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed, or driven into the vicinity of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options to protest, it turns out," said Seyoum Teshome, a dozent in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are many complaints that cover everything from the ground use to the wreaky in relation to power of governing coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the governing party and its associations received the last seat of opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a fight around this tangible, controversial line demanded hundreds of life in June.
Analytics fear that separationists such as the Oromo liberation front or the national front of the Ogade, which have been forced more or less, could benefit from turbulences and retain themselves in recent years.
Several factors explain why the feelings of bitterness explode now after years of prior to chickening under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years, many Ethiopers have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more frequent and improved Internet services.
Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular distances, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopers indicated that they gathered into protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, two largest Ethnia in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eonies, the Amharas, who come from Ethopia’s mostly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the omos, many Muslims are and live in flatlands areas.
But that's just about to change.
"We are about to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated unfairly by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which are about 6 percent of the population and dominant in military, secret services, trade and policy.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years of Ethiopia's Prime Minister until his death at a non-publical disease in 2012.
He was regarded as a tactic genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly decorated in taking early signs of satisfaction and using special officer to handle opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic fat," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analytic.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been selected for relative reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analytics say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an intrusion in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which seemed to have been planted by the government and then stolen by analytics.
During the following race, many protesters have been killed, even if it was less than in the last months, and this time of unrest was relatively quickly passed.
Developing experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendler move, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty control.
It is clear that this has not prevented the reinforcement of the internal defect of the äthiopic government.
And she accepts a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked by Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.
Analytics say that protests bring the USA and other Western bonds into a unique position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for drown flights on neighbouring Somalia, even if it recently said that it has closed this base.
During the West, it is clear that he wants to support democracy, he does not want his bondians to join together in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin grass migration."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had been "Sarkasmus" founded ISIS
Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday, surrounding his campaign by saying that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been seriously meant by the "grainer" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification called upon new questions on the communicating skills of the Presidentship candidates of the Republic of the European Union whether it could be able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his contests, who are trying to protect him during an event-rich phase, in its own position to explain statements that he could not have meant.
After making the Andeutung at a election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rejoiced about the claim on Thursday and in interviews, that he really did not intend to point out that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a early morning twin on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The second was the contrast to the previous day when Mr Trump said in a series of interviews, he thought the accusation was quite serious.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt Mr Trump wanted to help to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama ISIS wanted to destroy, the republic presidentship candidate wanted nothing to know about it.
The last storm of the criticism runs down on Mr Trump, while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling survey values.
Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton held talks about economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr Trump tried to return to this subject again.
He reported on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boringly.
Mr. Trump has already presented Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he moved strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later said "I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr Trump to move the linguistic limits in politics and then to return after need.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clear" depending on the way the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates.
I also believe that he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.
Instead of deteriorating the sound for the presidency elections, Mr Trump adopted an even more anticipated sound, as its survey values have continued to fall back.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership in the state of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-an-head race in Florida.
While Mr Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocations, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstood his Humor.
But while he is more focused on the attention of his presidency campaign in the last months, Mr Trump's Scherze has brought his loyal contests into the uncomfortable situation to stand with him, regardless of how provocable his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent speakers, gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was a almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbounds, perfectly wrong, and so it happened because he turned off the troops from Iraq.
Most of the Mainstream Republics are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as a minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to expand by enabling them to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and filed them to travel on every of his words and to be presepted against him.
He refrained the "arm, jealous" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats felt sorry about Mr Trump's announcement than just another evidence that he was unequivocal to the Presidential office.
Once over the price of the market, Café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a small cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay bar that had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prizes from his Bedford Avenue shopfront were defeated.
The company Soap Cherie, the verb replaced in summer 2014, sells Seife in the form of Cupcakes.
Locals trusted it as the last loss in a city that is produced.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I can still not believe that CBGB dead, Chelsea Hotel, and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York's change, it's also new invention.
A re-established verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a miles north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar light atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employer of the old café, the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outdoor site, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, helped a lot.
Verb used the same distributor for the bays bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the food map there are sandwiches with speck and cheese and there are garnages such as capsules and sauced cigars.
There are natural travel committees.
The cafe no longer serves beer, there are fresh soaps.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a sting power on old tribal customers.
"Many old customers were also endured by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb had been closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that enjoyed me," she said.
Now she drinks again coffee, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on this day instead of her usual Iced Coffee.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-term and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went in front of the work there and ordered inevitably always the same thing.
"I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss bag clock, and they prepare my everything ball with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu.
Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he turns off his everything ball with speck, ice and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he wasn't whispering that the soap business took up the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special lake for verb with the cold-brown coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going into her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional, Polish residents also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to discharge them soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has further advantages.
A local juice place wants to fill and sell the cold-brown coffee into the bottle.
There is a chance that the café expands to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was tribal science and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that the entering of the local and ordering felt a new coffee like a home return.
"I had to call it," he said.
The depressive food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine mecker, President Roosevelt had a faculty for raffinated delicates of the Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water shields.
His menu on this day was a bit more moderate: filled eggs in tomato sauce, cartoffelpüree and as dessert a pflaumen pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added," it was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes Last Book "Chop Suey" was spoken of the Chinese kitchen in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a living house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A permanent meal", which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publishing site, illustrates the history of the American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless imbis in the Flatiron district, which has been in business since the Börsencrash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while coe, 57, trothahn with cartoffelpure and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this was appropriate for a discussion on food in the era of great depression.
"Rich-wide foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was ground bread, liver cheese and bone bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something low that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine to eat so many natural nuts that they serve them as dinner.
Cost.
"It must have laid himself in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, a all-you-Can-Eat-Buffet.
Teams of women bought for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
They were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" sets out the ways to avoid being the country's slaraffenland.
"It was a time when food was a centrally stressed topic for the Americans," Coe founded why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget diet was stressed: mysterious foods such as breads and cassette rolls were used to re-establish the cassettes as "madely kind of food re-evaluation," said Ziegelman, as cooks were able to hide inappropriate ingredients under a cream Sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drobe.
Meat, which was the center of the American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Individual mixtures were tested because a calorie-rich and nutritional satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy cuisine.
During their accounts for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this epoch, baked cigarette with earthnus feed.
"It was not a popular addition to lunch," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Natural butter and baked cigarettes do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since then, budgetary economic operators - including Louise Stanley, Head of the Federal Office of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - driven the habits of the country of such a kind.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "Haushaltspolitics" and the challenge of transforming pamps like cream spaghetti with carottes into delicious meals.
A Square Meal is a festival of the historical leakages.
In particular, the reports on the government's answer to the hungry citizens, as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen-Halung.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchens of his kitchen, he was like the millions of a man from the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental kitchen like fish with barbecue sauce," Coe said.
He eated in a nearly golden dining room and wore a smoking.
He was wonderfully strange.
President Roosevelt may have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to establish an exempel with his stomach.
As described in the book, the anchor of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortless prepared."
Many of the species from the era of great depression, dealing with food, were rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs.
Our continuing focus on calories and foods lies in the contradiction, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman’s pregnant - for example, as they couldn't throw food away.
"She had a real fear of feeding," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered: "She really made people sick."
There was the wind bag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg, they and Coe brought out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the Pflaumendessert, the President Roosevelt at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to miss moderate recipes a sent name.
There were no slaughter sands, only plums, something meal, sugar, water and cime.
Everyone refusing to enter a leaf in the taste, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe took three times a followup.
Like a Can-Do-Budger, he said to his wife, "A few hacked whales would help."
At bomb attack, he was the hero of Aleppo
He set up his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old even died in a fasbomben attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group, which, according to image time, saved about 600,000 people.
2900 volunteers put their own life on the game to pull people out of broken houses and to provide first help in the war area.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian, which shows him in an 11-hour rescue of a nurse from the trunks of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian to illuminating symbol in the crown of war.
But as heroes he never saw himself, he said, "For me this is the real Jihad."
"If I die in saving life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar fell a victim of attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
Helicopter threw four fasbombs over the Alzadia County, one was filled with chlorgas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathnote.
"We now remove the toxic remains of the bomb so that children do not play it," the image quotes his last words before he dies.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime should have met terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest whirlpet is nearly 400 years old
Several sights.
Greenlandhaie usually comes to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the board of the research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the Northatlantics - until today.
Greenlandhaie only gets new adults by 150 years.
The Greenlandhai combines along the ground of the North Atlantic, and in an hour it is about 1,220 meters away.
Only when it gets up, the five meters long accelerated the animal on sat 2,6 km/h - and is half as fast as a robbery with this maximum speed.
This lifestyle of long-term life seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least by a Greenlandhai that could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", Alexander Scheuerlein commented by the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this lifespan for Wirbeltiere means a world record.
Although evolution biologists had long thought that Greenlandhaie is stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenlandhaie is difficult to watch, and finally they live in the Éism in front of the thin coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees of Celsius, they usually rise on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenlandhaie accordingly.
They measure their time lupentempo when they spent six animals with a sender before peak mountains.
Yet, these sharks make: In the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a robbery, another had swallowed the chickens of a young ice bear.
Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrouillians on the ground of the eism, seeking caravans that stumble down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenlandhaie, which took fishermen from the depth of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres were measured.
In order to identify the age of the animals, they analysed the lens cores of the shark with the carbon-14 method.
This centre of the eyelinse is already created before the birth of the hair, which contains proteins in it will not be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
It should therefore be born after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tried to sleeve larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the 320 centimeter length, the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons requesting, it may have celebrated its 50th birthday during his investigation in 2012.
On the other hand, all the larger greenlands haie had normal carbon-14 measles that are produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, for a 493 centimetres long greenlandshai, the carbon 14-hur showed an age of 335 years, while the record-Hai may be even 392 years old with 502 centimeters.
That the Greenlandhai-week only gets refrigerations when they are longer than four meters, was known.
Now the researchers of the length were able to order an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold for sex maturity and was determined by its age of 156, Greenlandhaie may be at least one and a half centuries of time.
This would also be a world record for turbulence animals at present.
That such methusalem lives mainly in eisy waters is not an accident.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old greenland whale, in whose species was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska.
Due to low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on spare flames.
So they mature later - and aging slower.
In order to warm up in the cold water, the animals will also often be particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal uses heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than a gram elephant.
Another advantage: You have less enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should focus on having as early as possible many offspring," explains Evolution Biologist Scheuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in double pack
With topics around construction, the Council of the municipalities has discussed seriously in the recent session.
With enlightenment, the body recorded the Communication by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently indicated residential areas can begin".
After clarifying the ground, parcelation, and locking questions and making applications for measurement, the sale of the grounds in the residential areas of "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - expansion section 1) is no longer in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community are beautifully young families and spacious secondarys.
As it was said, construction volunteers can be reported immediately in the Council house, the Council of the municipal authorities is expected to consult in his September session.
In order to also make requests for the development of other commercial firms, related to the creation of jobs to be able to comply with, the Council of the Community decided to amend the areas of use which were first created in the spring of this year in part areas.
Thus, in the field of subtimelars, the commercial area already shown there is expanded by two parcels towards state road 2112.
Frankfurt profits from Brexit
The city at Main has thus the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt profits most of the Brexit-Votum," says Michael Voigt Länder, head of the financial market and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain that monetary homes may continue to operate from London from financial operations throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU Pass, they have been authorised in Britain.
This just uses large US banks.
Several banks have already announced that they have moved jobs.
The lobby cleaning "Frankfurt Main Finance" is calculated by 10000 new jobs at the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, speaks the seat of the European Central Bank (EZB), associate the responsibility for monetary policy and supervisory management over the largest euro area banks, as well as other important authorities such as EIOPA and the ESRB risk Council.
In Paris, the organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The closeness to the note bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisory," says IW-Professor Voigt countries.
Although Luxembourg has a large fund sector, it is better to cut as well as Dublin in infrastructure.
Frankfurt would be much easier to reach, thanks to the big airport.
The city also points with easy-to-use commercial mobiles.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free quality offices," says Voigt countries.
At the same time, the rentals for high-quality commercial real estates were 50 percent higher than at Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a Ranking of Mercer's company advice, the city stands on place seven, Luxembourg at place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris at 37th place.
Even if life quality is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial place for the European Internal Market, Frankfurt might attract other banks and investors," the IW says.
However, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, economic researchers believe.
In London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, around 144000 people in the banking industry, there were 62500 people in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent conflict with Merck
A U.S. official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc claims to repeal the legal costs that you have created from the Hepatits C dispute with the Pharmaceutical Company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released by a damage payment of $200 million for the infringement of two patents of Merck, which were covered by the Sovaldi blockbusts and Harvoni's Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of lack of behavior by Merck, including Myides and other unethical acts.
In the survey of the complaint on Thursday, US official Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has claimed to obtain the costs created during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to compare Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck accused each other and claimed property for laboratory work, which found Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the Gilead medicines.
Truppen supported by the United States say that they have re-established complete control of Manbij from the Islamic State.
Of the United States, the full control of the northern city of Manby has been rejoined near the Turkish border after the last IS campaigns in the city left them, said a group's speaker on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) come through after the extraction of the still remaining group of fighters who have buried in the city currently the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as a hostage, Sharfan Darwish shared the man by military councils of the DKS Reuters.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just running up-to-date work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% Federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its statement of tax for 2015 on Friday, which was awarded an income of $10,75 million for the Presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34,2%.
In 2015, Clinton's USD 1 million for well-active purposes spent, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton commissioned nearly $5.3 million in speechhonoraries; the former minister of Foreign Affairs gave an income of $3 million from the Verlag Simon & Schuster for her book on their term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published his tax statements in the past ten years together with his wife Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a rough contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false interpretations and retreaters in relation to its previous promises to publish its tax statements.
It is common for US Presidentship candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not obliged by law to it.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have stated a tax test by the tax authorities as a cause for refusal.
"They are on the train," wrote Clinton's election campaigner Ian Sams on Twitter, concerning the publication of the Presidentship candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax tests are not finished.
Trump's critics, including the Republican Presidentship candidate of the year 2012, have already made it clear that his refusal has raised questions regarding assets, its donations for well-acting organizations, its business and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-ranging Republican Trump calls for his tax declaration to be published.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on economics in Michigan.
"He refused to do what every other Presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax statements." she said to the quantity.
Politico reported that Trump had paid no or only very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the milliard and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that the more than USD 1 million earns a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election campaign event for Hillary Clinton during the last week in Omaha, Nebraska called Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is here to exchange Trump to a meeting on their tax statements.
Buffett said that he had also been subject to a tax test of the IRS and Trump had "angst" before the electors and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's Campaign has published tax declarations in due course until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5%.
The Clinton tax declaration of 2015 showed that it was only $100 of its income as a wage, other than the majority of all the Americans.
Their main money plant was a cost-effective index fund from which the Clinton's dividends and earnings of USD 109,000 were taxed.

Condom with Chilipuder, Fuels promote Tanzania's Elefanten Protection
Nature guards in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to keep elephants from going in people living settlements - they throw condome on them that are filled with Chilipuder.
The method has been effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea for years ago, has intensified its promotion together with US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in the northern Tanzanias to use a violent four-level method to protect their homes and harvests without injured animals.
Many spears have used before to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephants Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed the ... Toolkit, we could watch a change in their attitude within these communities, while they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said the director of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a fake and bubble in a horn.
If he is not scared, a so-called "Chiliwolke" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth together with a fireworking body is packed into a condom whose end is turned to the tinch.
When it gets knocked, the condom lays up with a knee and sprays fine dust on chilipuder into the air.
A crochet usually already out to hunt the elephant.
A last option represents a Werfer that shoots a gold rain firework into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimous: No new building at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, the St. Goarer's investment projects by business operators with kisshand assume that the retail trade in the core city is significantly constructive.
The request for the rebuilding of a sales skiox on the Rheinufer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balkon in the construction now refused unanimously.
"In general, we are welcomed to welcome new business driver, but at this location in an exponent location at Rheinufer this Kiosk is not true," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director breaks Berliner Hotel, because Israelian preferential for "Arabic" request was removed - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots escaped a media trigger after he betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli preferential option as it "required Arab guests" according to an employer.
Claude Lancemann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" released his trouble in the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lancemann Israel tried to find the hotel's country preferential list.
However, the country was not listed between countries that could be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own Call Center.
After a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "shocked him," as Lancemann wrote.
The hotel employer said that the measure is a "decisive decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason thereafter stood out in the director even more angry.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have required the pre-existance to be deleted," was quoted by Lancemann's employees.
The Israeli Ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great harm," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were defeated and crashed by this event.
That's very embarrassing.
The fact that this has contributed in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a greater harm.
That doesn't need any explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," said the officer.
The incident eluded a quite great resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole of them a scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "remitted" to the supposed demands of Arab guests.
"Shame you," it said another contribution, in which it was noted that the hotel that is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm stands near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the accusations of itself and called the incident a "look" and "expelled" at Lancemann, reports The mirror.
"There was never a direct instruction," not taking Israel into the quick election list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the preliminary election of the countries has now been added.
Police introduces tear gas & rubber dishes against protesting Brazilian students
Students met the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered together to demonstrate the reforms of the government for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber dishes against the demons.
The difficulty started when police officers tried to get out of each other, which led the police to use rubber dishes and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their danger over the plans.
According to the proposals by the Governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools are closed, while 3000,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants were seen to sprinkle graffits against the preliminary president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place several days after demonsmen went on to the streets to support the suspendd President Dilma Rousseff, who had been dismissed from the office by a vote of the senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the withdrawal of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran in the year comparison increased by 70.9 percent.
Since the international sanctions have been withdrawn against Iran, the interest on pages of Russian companies in businesses in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador shared.
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran, while new companies are ready to provide access to the market.
Of course, further trading is one of the largest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and increased 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade force was reached by supplies of machines, agricultural vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is part of a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation gave about 3,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries, as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken last year, "he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something that the ambassador hopes that it will change.
"I can personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses searched: overlap the drink market in Waldbröl
A robbery accident has been practiced on the drinking market of Rewe XXL on the Forest Broiler Gerberstraße on Thursday evening.
Under the preservation of a gun, three dark dressed persons who had mummed their faces demanded the production of cash and then fled to foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW-golf.
How much money was paid, the police don't share.
The daders should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters, so relatively small.
The drinking market is directly accessible from the parking corner of the rewe market and is poorly available.
After the accident, the daders must be flee in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the shoe parking on the front of the parking park with the silver-colour car, possibly in direction B 256 (loader ring).
Those who have made observes related to the robbery at the time of the present (gegen 19.45 p.m.) are to report to the police.
Nagold: game and fun at summer free time
Eight beautiful and joyous days, the children and adolescents of the social pedagogic day group/social group work of the Nagold family with their maintainers at their summer free time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtwäldle, the lively group was inquarified during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
To one end it went to Bretten with the visit of the Streichelzoo.
On the other hand, after Maulbronn, where there was a special child training in the world’s famous cluster.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the daily life and food of the Kelten.
At the hot days the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maulbronn, which was part of jumping, swimming and planting.
Kulinarian children and maintainers were invented with their ownly prepared body spices such as the sauren latezle, the lake sourcer Pfännle, Iselshauser Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry pieces of pearls and stones were created or produced from wood a Roman-mill game.
Further highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bunte evening".
On the day of the home trip, the sun and the children and youths laughed satisfaction.
Shooting hole: Pilgers for mercy
The minismen from the Seelsorge unit of Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrim migration from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were managed.
In order to overbrow the time to the next Rome walling journey of all ministries in an estimated two years, St. Anna has decided to prepare and implement a multi-day pilgrim migration.
Various walling targets were examined and they decided for the Bishopsstadt Freiburg, where this year, during the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilger target was offered with the comfort of mercy to be opened at the Freiburger Münster.
16 minis from pleased sources, gruol, hole and sacred rooms were on the way.
On the evening before, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrims.
From Horb was driven to Villingen by train, where a Municipality's loved woman also stands and thus came to the Pilgerweg from Münster.
The individual day tours were embraced by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures in the morning and evening.
But also on the way, the minis made on field crosses, chapels, or churches repeatedly to sing together a song of ownly compiled pilgrim-lift.
For the overnights, the parish homes of the local priests were available.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Fallser provided a delightful and strengthening dinner and breakfast at the destinations.
On the second day it went about Furtwangen nach Gütenbach.
The stage to St. Peter, which was the most excited route, had to rise to about 500 meters during the swimming heat, and then to be smelled again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue on the bath pasture.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrim day in the imposant Klosterkirche of St. Peter, it went to the finaletappe to Freiburg.
Visually facilitated and happy, the minis met in the later afternoon on Freiburger Münster and passed through the pace of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
The minis of Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed at the evening fair in Münster.
After the service of God, the pilgrims were able to visit the Sakristei and the Highaltar.
The next day there was time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were characterized.
Shotte Callum Skinner stirs home when British gold wins for wheel sports
Schottlands Callum Skinner last night in the man team print in the Velodrome in Rio to Ruhm when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself own. The virgin pound made the legend proud when he stirred home to enter a victory from the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed four years ago a shocking victory, while Hoy took the fifth of six olympiagold medals.
They repeated the trick after they took a moderate sixth place in March at the Bahn Worldmeisterschaften in London, despite the return of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the rider Jamie Staff.
They did this time as the Hinds.
Hoy's restoration produced a lime that tried to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when she saw potential in the shot that has now escaped.
Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and skinners put an olympia record in the skill rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealands overwhelmed in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
After his round, Hindes was just back, but Kenny brought the team forward and skinner held it.
A change in the strategy made a large part of the transformation, in which the hind went in a higher way to slow him down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the tempo.
Hoy looked up from his position as BBC expert and fell skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they went to the podest.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said, "It is a melting comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We have set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Championships.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to gain this.
After the Triumph 2012 on Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he fell on the train.
He later returned this statement and there was no objection of England's rival.
In such an exciting victory, there was no problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels with all the GB flags on the Tribone like London."
We've come together as a team in the last three months.
We got so bad away from so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympiade.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form of Kennys it is in the area of the potential that he repeats Hoy's victory of three olympics of gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny - the exact 12 years younger than Hoy who was born on March 23, which was also born (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Baneckel) was born - a exploitation of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's what Hoy's.
Kenny next takes part in the Sprint that starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old of Bolton said, "I enjoy this only for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels lonely to win alone.
Hinds said, "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be be be beat to the rider."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the Four-Vier-Kilometer race.
They arrived at the target in 3:51.942.
The world record, won in 2012 in London Gold, was at 3:51.659.
Today, the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the betbewer, with which Wiggins will certainly be focused.
He had committed himself with responsibilities yesterday before the qualification when he called him functional to measure his body size.
The corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, assembled Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie in the world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team leaves itself on its strong railway team to dominate the mean period of the Olympics and to get a scar of medals.
After a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were taken down.
Dramas played in the background, according to the withdrawal of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and mobbing prevails and the rest of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of competition in the Velodrome, it looks quite after it as if the legendary call of GBs, which has reached its high point at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of the melting of Portland due to the withdrawal of the energy contract
The future of the aluminum melting of Portland in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is on the game, as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thus lifts up all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company informed.
This step followed the decision by the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to not give any further subsidies to the operation of the facility.
An subsidie established for 20 years will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are on the game.
Not less than 2000 jobs - indirect and indirect - could be in danger of closing.
In addition, Domino effects could be given to approximately 10 percent of the total electricity production of Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which last year led to a closing of the Anglesea power plant.
The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a close.
This step follows the years of speculations with regard to the future of the plant, originally due to the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which delivers the large aluminium melting industry with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that three other owners will announce their contracts.
The facility is located in the multitude possession of a joint company of Alcoa and Alumina, which holds smaller shares from the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese marubeni Corp.
"AGL assumes that the investment in Portland will continue to operate, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt," the company informed.
AGL continued to state that the contracts were called "security operations" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month announcement period so that they will end 2017.
"But therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the 17 financial year," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impact on revenues to AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong deadline markets for wholesale flow prices.
AGL noted that the value of the contracts has already been recorded in its annual conclusion of $ 187 million in "expecting an announcement".
Alcoa said that the decision to pay out the contracts, to operate the "Furity of Alcoas... the melting sector or to ensure electricity supply to the melting sector" does not interfere.
The US company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year-old contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still a declaration why it came back from the Treaty.
Analytics warned from the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closing of the Portland melting industry in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the statements of the analytics at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatt and Tomago every year about 900 megawatt to electricity.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in the demand on the [stroop market].
And for us the power producer wouldn't be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand newspaper of Estee Lauder, who was running on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this covers brought me to wine," wrote Kendall.
The discovery of the Covers followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), written reality video that shows the entire Cardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems of Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz-Onkels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and end this with a classic turning: they all have planned an surprise saving.
This represents the clinic act nearly every birthday episode of a child mission (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought that we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a signrick canal on a missioning place at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls somewhat participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to hit the Vogue cover (they and her husband Kanye West were able to see in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a Liga for itself.
The September edition is for Vogue the most likely issue of the year.
With a range which is more like an image band than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of adverters (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the lake 615 pages advertising).
It is so eager to reveal his cover star that in the last two years, images of the magazine have been transmitted before the official notice.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelsta and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more "Berohmtheiten, the models" were "the models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar prize leader and dior trademark messageman Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even at the low chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "brown model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These famousities are not related to famous persons, or reality stars or young people today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (although all of them look like Jenner).
They are really talented women who characterize themselves in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success does not like everyone.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always stressed.
In June, the unique Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them as "the pieces of the moment."
These feelings bought up again when the message came out with Jenners on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to be passing on the point of misunderstanding.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue's September edition.
It is a super model in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
They and all their sisters sell images from themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sold pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure time she's in the reality TV. It's probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
municipal rights centres show 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's most beneficiaries are rejected annually by the municipal legal centres, while the sector is focused on the impact of further budgetary shortcomings on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three of five - most older persons, immigrants, helpful workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogging and similar - are already rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively charged, make available for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centres will lose more than 30 per cent of their federal resources.
The director of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Right Centers revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year.
Farrell said that without a withdrawal of the Federal Government decision, the situation would only become worse.
"Queensland municipal rights centres are chronicly underfinanced, meaning that thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with unprecedented and depressive debts, families who go through separation, workers who have been unjustified - all of these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The Federal Government will shorten the funds from June 2017 by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any aid.
We call on the Advocate General and Federal Justice Minister and Queensland's Senator George Brandis to immediately lift up these central shortcomings, so that the people can receive the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the national government has fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal rights centres and their client communities and that the Government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work.
Donald Trump accused election campaigns after employers claimed to go Waffe
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused for suspicious inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February had directed a shot weapon on a staff while they were going in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in a claim address submitted on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini in the Landesgericht of Charlotte, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini suggested to have waited for months that the matter would be internally regulated before he realized that "this wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drew a pistool, put his right finger on the deduction, and framed the course in Vincent's kneestal," told Bordini in his accusation.
After he had distressed at the local and regional campaign, Bordini found that at least four more people had made the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the address of the appeal.
"Waves don't need to be fired to harm," said Bordini.
The claim comes only two days after the republican Presidential candidate brings an excitement when he said a crowd of people in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - Schuss weapon owners and weapons - should take action if his rivian Hillary Clinton should be chosen and call Judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had snatched his words from the context and that he wouldn't stimulate violence.
Bordini's complaint requires damage from the campaign for the infringement of the care obligation and of Philip because of body injuries and lasting moral damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was unable to reach a opinion.
Trying to contact Philip likewise failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reported that Phillip is no longer a staff of the campaign.
No response was made to calls with his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign until now.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Swerin: Survey for Countries-Waals: Lose SPD and CDU
With the upcoming elections in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4. September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the governmental parties SPD and CDU.
This gave representative surveys of the INSA opinion research institute for the 'image' newspaper (Friday).
While the red-swake government coalition in the north could be little further ruled, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue setting the Head of State.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern the SPD crashed from 35.6 percent from five years ago to 24 percent.
The party, according to the survey, will only be charged shortly before the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is surrounded between the links and the AfD.
The links were 19 percent (18.4 percent before), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent first in the country day.
In spite of light losses, the greens will resume with 6 percent (about 8.7 percent) again in the heavy country day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent on the country day.
The SPD of the survey was only 23 percent of the SPD (Wahl 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They are still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the links with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House by 14 percent first.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope to return, however, the pirates would miss the entry against 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Timelupe: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The followers dominated the world today - his manufacturer experienced a desaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it wasn't good.
On the contrary, it was quite clever.
The built-in memory was at the beginning eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution today.
A iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came to the shops just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can buy the devices still on the Internet, but they are somewhat from the stone of the Internet Age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as "Büro in the West Tax Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to get a lot of: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the Communicator was able to reach.
Even the access to websites was possible by HTML browser, even if it was slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a little antenna, and the phone could be shooted like a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black-wit screen found.
Very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
In August 1996, no one could know that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone Éra.
Since then, everything has been different.
The clever phones are a story of success, although not for Nokia.
The mobile section of the finder experienced an exampleless desaster, was finally sold to Microsoft and turned off.
Today, market providers who all came much later as Nokia.
Be always online, this is today for many people everyday.
In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold on Samsung and Apple alone were 555 million pieces.
The worldwide sales of the devices is around EUR 400 billion.
These include the well-running businesses of the countless app providers and the telecommunications group.
Around the smartphone has now created a whole industry.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market first at the beginning of 2007, Apple-Chef Steve Jobs at the Mac World announced the introduction of iPhone.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator to easily use everything by touch screen.
The Siegeszug of Apple began, yet today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the suspicion.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The statement now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is 20 years after its invention.
Today, every German is now looking for his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We must all learn to get away the smartphone also," said just Janina Ball, in the Siemens Board for Personal.
Stay at the same time as a flight and blessing.
England must guide the Olympic Spirit and extend Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London.
For me, this was the largest attraction of Heathrows, as it was in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympic Olympic brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already end 10.000 new teachings, create 40 000 new jobs, and end up youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they had been for us in London 2012, there will be such ones who will think that the challenge of the Heathrow enlargement is too large.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame on the world tree.
The two bottles had injustice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked for him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals a infrastructure project.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of scientific growth, and to leave a minority of capabilities and employment both around the airport and throughout the GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion of expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - the world's best airport terminal for five years, until the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequent runways in the world.
Now they are ready to provide a third runway, supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to guide this Olimpian spirit and extend Heathrow and ensure our future trade and create a minority of skills and employment that can be proud to England.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and Mouse Game" on display blocking
For companies who earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to deal with ad-blocking, a "coat and mouse game" equal.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it informed that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network again.
On Tuesday Facebook informed that his desktop page would change the coding with regard to its ads to detect the display blocking of the detection of which part of the advertising page is to be recognized.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to deal with the new codes.
In a blog post, the Adblock Ben Williams speaker wrote that "these type of Hin-und-Her campaign between the advertiser blocking open source community and the converter has already been in progress since the invention of ad-blockers," and that Facebook is possible soon with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company for social media has put itself into battle is a strong index for how worrying ad-blocker has become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe, some 200 million people use ad-blockers; almost four times so much 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices daily, mobile advertising is 84 percent of the advertising revenue Facebooks.
The company has looked at ad-blockers on desktop PCs, since mobile ad-blockers do not have effect on Facebook's mobile app for social network and instagrams, a speaker shared.
Advertisement on Desktop PCs is a sufficient share of revenue so that Facebook appears to be a worthless investment of such a step.
On Tuesday Facebook said that it would update its "display preference tool" to have more control over their targeted advertising for people.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be anxious because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook speaker shared in an e-mail communication.
Display blockers are a stupid means, instead of focusing on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into the people's hands.
Woman at probably suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police calls Witnesses after a woman had been transmitted in the early morning hours on Thursday at a probable suicide of several vehicles on a carbahn.
The incident occurred near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman put on the street in the dark "in an act of desperation" and was hit by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss who was 49 years old wanted to kill himself by several vehicles, including a truck.
She's still in the place.
Several drivers have already been taken, but some have still not been identified, said the police who invited them and every Witness to report themselves.
A research procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be waiting for one of the drivers to be shown.
Was a collapse avoidable?
That's something that the lawyer must decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not responsible.
In each of the two cases - where one person runs in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the car drivers must not take care of a footganger running on the road in the middle of the night, as it was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released from the perpetual killing after overwhelming and killing a man who was near Payerne in August 2014 at the A1 night.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become conscious on the street, the court took.
The court found that the policeman -- who had answered a emergency call -- was justified and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfect extraordinary and unpredictable situation", said the judge.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report at the police under 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model has been designed to determine whether the Venus could have already given earthlike conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 density.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and still slowly revolved.
The model also highlighted the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably raised more dry areas than the earth, but once enough water and geographical variability had to preserve life and protect from rapid dilution.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus exposes its daily side of the sun almost two months long," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a rain screen to protect the surface from a large part of the sun warms.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution, which was presumed by planet researchers before.
Although she was even probably inhabitable, the Venus was over more billion years -- too much heat and ultraviolet light exposed.
Her oceans were diluted and their water vapor was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
When her Hydrogen remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus, who as we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Model in the Geophysical Research Letter.
Patrick Roy goes back as a trainer of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy returned as a trainer and Vice President of the Colorado Avalanche's operations on Thursday and led to a low co-determination right to the team’s decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have met my obligations as head trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said Roy 50-year-old.
I have been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth, this needs and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly agreed to the organization.
It must also have a right to co-determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had remembered on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded as the best trainer of the Liga during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14.
He led the association to 112 points and to the first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten the after season in the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesota and missed it in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot at the Western Conference at five points.
As a Hall of Fame Torwart Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North-Sea oil workers resume conversations, sets stress out
The labour struggles on the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all parties are at the table for a new round of conversation, the negotiator said.
Streiks against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Units and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the development process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will take up some whole day meetings in the next weeks, which will begin the beginning of the next year to re-establish the problems.
The trade unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's shortening of the rate follows a 10-procent decline in our surgery contractor in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions to the company are the required space to get through the market absorption.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to suspend its oil and gas operations into up to 10 countries, as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its Mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower roast trip, a economic situation which had increased by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met in the beginning of this week with workers in order to discuss one of the greatest conflicts of work that took place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few," he said in one statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion will be expected on expenditure for new projects in the North Sea compared to average $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler misss rotation rates of stars in the star pillows of the Plejaden
The latest mission with the Kepler Weltraumteleskop has helped astronomers to collect the fullest catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejaden's stars.
The new data help the astronomers understand why stars are rotating into different rates and what is the context of rotation periods with planet development.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age, and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star hops of the Plejaden are 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star hip, which have created about 125 million years ago, now reach adult age.
They're now the fastest.
To top rotation rates, these mature stars extrude large amounts of starwinds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a brimming effect on the stars.
When a star is old, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler misss the rotation rate of every star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognized constellation -- like sunflakes --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates points out that massive stars are slower to rotate than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slow pirouts than smaller ones.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejaden, we see that slow rotors tend to be massiver, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the star hops of the palejads are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualitys such as rotation rates.
"The star hops of the Plejaden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the Stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
It is still much before us that we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and thus hang their "tax shoes" down.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejaden, which will soon appear in the astronomical Journal.
A surpassed baseball star goes off
The tears went faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US-Baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional return notice, the 41-year-old Profi will last wear the tricot of his New York Yankees on August 12, against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-year-old all-star game participants of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was chosen three times as the most valuable player of the Liga, he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has paid him every year 27 million US dollars since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he functions as consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 he created a few milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players show similar values in the main statistics.
But the 41-year-old should not be taken into the rohmeshalle of the Baseball.
For so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversy is his appearance outside the place.
Since 2009, the Superstar admitted "ESPN" to have taken prohibited steroid between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was locked for 211 parties in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received high-performance resources through an anti-Aging clinic in south-Florida.
After a legal dispute, the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings.
"The Liga could even have done a pleasure for the year 2014 because I played 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at that time suffisant.
His divorce days too aren't running ruinlessly.
While many baseball lyers in their last games have received the big stage again, Rodriguez had to sit on the bank often.
"My job does not include a divorce tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and was conveyed with Popstar Madonna and the actress of Kate Hudson, Sympathy detections of the fans of Yankee-Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang at the 4:9-declaration against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Targetinski are first doping cases
Fight: Because of a positive doping sample, weight maker Adrian targetinski should not start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overlooked by the first official doping cases.
A purged atletin had almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimer Chen Xinyi, 3000 meter-Hindernisläufer Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightheber Adrian targetinski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the still critical lightathletic competitions these messages come to the time.
The diureticum of hydrochlorothiazide has been demonstrated in Chen last Sunday, which is used as a masking means for doping substances.
The CAS International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion of the Olympics on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday the 18-year-olds had occupied the fourth place in the final more than 100 m butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the predictions over 50 m freestyle.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested Chen to open the B-Probe and a hearing.
The national association takes the issue "what seriously and demands of chen full cooperation in the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment."
First in history, IOC is no longer responsible for sanctifying the sporters with positive cases.
At the same time in the night of Rio, the message of the positive sample at Danekowa passed through, the 33-year-olds went into the openness.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "a unbelievable shock," she said the Bulgarian TV sender BNT.
She's innocent, "the only declaration could be food supplements," said the lightathletin.
According to the report, the prohibited substance should be the EPO blood doping agent.
Danekowa was temporarily suspendd, according to BNT, the B probe should have already been positive.
Bulgaria’s President Bojko Borissow reported immediately with criticism at the Athletin.
"I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians stand under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight makers from the chronic doping nation should not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Targetinski" was also known, the London Olympician in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabole steroid Nandrolon.
Both contradict the intake, however, both should not start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the light athletes, the case Danekova is a further difficult strike for the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Association IAF had prohibited the launch of the complete Russian team until a exception because of systematic dopings, including the Läufernation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In the swim sport, the former crimes in China had also made serious conflicts between the athletes.
So the Franzose Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympician Sun Yang harsh.
"Sun Yang pinkelt lila."
"If I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to pass," Lacourt said in the French radio.
Sun was also focused on a conflict with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping frauders," said this.
Sun was tested positively in 2014 at the Chinese Championships on the Stimulan Trimetazidin, but only a three-month lock had to take place.
Data clause: So perfectly press hacker's solvent
Developers of depression malware are currently attacking targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a current survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once in the past 12 months, partly several victims of a attack with dispressed software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already targeted by ransomware depression.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the solvents required by the deaths in order to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize their presser software according to the detections of malwarebytes on attacks in business networks.
If they are successful there, the potential solvent to be pressed is much higher than in private users.
"We are currently watching an alarming fast evolution of the malware software," says Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the world.
In 2008 most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the dads discovered depression software for themselves.
First, private users were the goal, but the change to business attacks took place in the past months in terrible speed.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, she looks focused on recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encode the ransomware and will permanently delete the originals.
Afterwards the software presents the demands of the pressors.
To get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Bitcoin.
But where private users face the personal photo database, companies are sensitive customer data or project databases that are without the steady of production.
As a result, the damage is higher when a ransomware is affected.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, many hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients could be acute threatened by loss of illness.
"We always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, will get their data again.
For managers, it is difficult to refuse the demand of the deceasants in view of the suspension in operation.
The hackers will know that and try to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contacts with the oppressors and come to the result: Täters are trying to actually build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat, how to pay by bitcoin, freely accessible support websites will correct or unencrypt other example files.
And, after payments from a few hundred euros, companies need to negotiate hardly and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.
Given the potential high and relatively riskless profits from Ransomware depression, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains Security experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "A individual person can write a ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that there are three or four persons.
The developers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software bouquet to the real depressors.
The previous malware kits created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 100,000 dollars.
"In the scope of delivery, an adjustment tool is included, so that smaller configurations, appearance and fire can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The oppressors then seek other hackers to distribute the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you are logging in one of the forests in the underground, buying the set of a criminal and ordering another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per computer infected.
"usually, the criminals then commission spam with distribution," Wisniewski explains.
Ransomware’s risk is now known to many companies that improve their data.
More than 50 percent of the company IT responsible in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can reject via file backups and scanner software.
Consequently, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.
"If the encryption of data is no longer a sufficient threat to successful determination, doers threaten using the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations", says Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski.
This makes the potential for damage depending on the type of data even more than before.
In the future, too, the perpetrators could take totally new goals on the Internet of things into corn.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the freezing of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom of some victims.
If the perpetrators then block a whole production street in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.
But the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V acts more small, the passengers have much space both in the first row and in the fond, it does not work closely.
The materials of the interior are well processed and are comfortable, only the cockpit upper side falls something.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the stau space.
It is not only a case room of 453 l for high-speed and 1026 l for reversal refusal, but there are "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seating surfaces of the back bank can be expanded like cinema cinema and thus offer stainlessness, which is 1.24 m high from the ground to the ceiling.
The bag room can be well charged, but the charge height of 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the rotation of up to 300 Nm in wide rotation areas.
However, he is supposed to do a little bit less.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is delightful.
There is another engineering: a 1.5 l benziner with 96 kW/130 PS.
A Allradantrieb is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering may be something more direct.
The equipment does not open wishes in the tested top variant "Executive".
The security systems include the City-Notbrem's assistant (works until tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track holder assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "animating objects".
The remote light wizard works very reliable.
And the intelligent temporegler responds to the traffic sign detection and drys the speed when needed.
But the full connectivity is only available for the top service: 7-inch touch screen, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI books are under the armlets and are therefore something surroundable to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in Ordnung.
If you do not want to invest so much, the petrol will receive EUR 20000, the diesel from EUR 23000.
The engines meet the Euro 6 gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: discharge on air gas bridge
A airline is not liable for the loss of a passenger on the air gas bridge.
Because liability is only possible for hazards that are typical for air transport, the Upper Landesgericht Düsseldorf argumented (Act: 18 U 124/14).
The complainant had broken a knee at the sturz.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, says the court.
The airline had to not pay any damage to the man.
Disease: When paying the organiser
Several holidaymakers only get back after their trip if the cause of the disease is unquestionably found in the hotel.
But that is only the case when more than ten percent of guests proved the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family on the second day of its Turkey vacation was severely affected by diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost the whole holiday in the room.
Their disease led the holidays to a broken clarity plant, which supposedly had polluted seawater.
The family was of the view that the journey was lacked – and complained against the organiser.
The complainants had no success before court.
Although the clarity was in fact broken.
But the organiser first learned just before the applicants traveled.
He had to go out until then that seawater was fine.
So he did not hurt his information obligations, so the judgment.
No impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - perhaps by contamination - belongs to the general risk of life.
From 691 guests were only 38 sick.
The Maizière said that after the violence acted by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people have worried about further attacks.
The State must note and decisively respond to threats of terrorism at the same time.
Surely, Our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and splitting.
This triumph we won't defeat the terrorists.
If criminals have to leave the country faster, but this increases security and also strengthens the consent of the population for refugee policy.
The Maizière wishes to achieve implementation of the proposals until the Bundestagswahl 2017.
He also announced another personal reinforcement of security forces, "in the middle of four-digit size order over several years".
Sympathy enforcement for terrorism must be under penalty again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, so novelling weapon law that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is difficulty.
The last much discussed difficulty for doctors should be maintained according to the Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with physicians, he wants to seek solutions to reduce the risks of citizens, he said with a view to psychic suspicions.
In order to counteract a radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for the handling of traumatized people.
In order to pursue criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet) the Maizière plants the use of covered mediators.
SPD-Chef Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of Interior has clearly expressed action against action.
"This was an odd feast for the Scharfmachers in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel the radio media group newspapers (Friday).
The Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the elimination of the double nationality.
A general prohibition of complete constituency considers it difficult for constitutional law.
You can't forbid everything you're rejecting, and I'll lose the wear of Burka.
You can talk about rules, such as road traffic or witnesses before court.
Green-Chefin Simone Peter prohibited the minister to simulate with always new anti-terror packages of activity and activity.
Link-Party Chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotte Proverbs and a deterioration of the right of residence will no longer bring people in this country security."
Improved transport flow on the car tractor
It regularly stands on the Umgehung road - here is a picture of November.
But this is to change: the prohibition of law should be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are in the road of care on the surrounding road every night when they drive over the car car (A 43).
The Landfire Streetbau extended the right to Abbiegerspur by 700 meters on the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Street and Weseler Street.
Car drivers can then start directly from the Hammer Street right.
The great advantage: Transport is more early, thus improving the total flow on the multi-speed section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU Group in the districts represented Münster-West.
The passenger's ride on the carrier is nervous, especially between 17 and 19 o'clocks.
Working days range the back to the bridge over the Albersloher and sometimes beyond it.
The reason is the needle tube on the B 51 just before the departure of Weseler Street.
From here, transport is only a single line over the carbahn bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilded well-third years ago.
The reason: Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary tragic force to take up, above all, the heavy load movements two-purely.
As long as this Engpass and the working time will last, the competent national business cannot say.
However, the bridge is expected by years: because the bridge has an official residual duration up to 2034.
For the extension of the legal abbreviation, the national business has consciously sought the weaker time in school holidays because of disabilities.
Transport is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the Forest School visited the theatre "The Invisible House".
The Nima's association and the boy theatre are planning a musical project now.
Nima's association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Children's House has visited a idea of the prize-knowing piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students visited the inszenation in the little house between 11 and 15 years.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has aimed at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions within this project in Münster.
Most of the adolescents of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among others, from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and talk little German.
Thanks to the choreography, the scene pictures and video animations, they could have been able to follow the course of action yet, the press release of the boy Theatre Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Languageel, and the boy theatre will work together in the coming game time in the context of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people will be able to visit professionally initiated courses in singing, dance, acting and music between 14 and 20 years of escape and migration.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatrale language mediation are in planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased refugee numbers, the association counts with many classes who want to participate.
Rain instead of star snails: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made a line through the bill to the stars in the Southwest of Germany in the night to Friday - yet there is still hope.
The night would have been badly suitable for clouds and rain to watch the spectacular, said the chairman of the Observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night to Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we certainly see many star snails in the sky.
The star ships are perseiden, which belong to the fastest constellations by 216,000 kilometers per hour.
Their name they have because they seemed to come out of the Pereus starry in the northeast.
Relaxable night: Tips for sleep disorders
In the evening you wake around forever, you're lying for hours awake, the morning is far before the whirlling is no longer to think of sleep.
That's everything else than restoration.
However, with such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent often feel their sleep or permanent than not restoring.
How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders explain?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes for them, Hans-Günter Weeß, Board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand below is the insomnie, which is an insomnia and a sleep disorder.
Just sleeping through, many people feel inadequate or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member in the German House doctor's association with practice in the Dutch Varel.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
It may be organic, psychic or behavioural factors but also medicines.
The sleep disorder is not rarely the expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is especially frequent in depression," says Witteß.
And it may be that different factors are compulsory.
For example, those who have a tape case can be bad, wait every two to three hours and may begin to wreak about everyday problems and concerns, gives white an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When do you need to get a doctor with sleeping disorders?
If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected on the day, you should go to the doctor, counsel whiteness.
The infringement may look very different: absorption, tired, unslapened, has problems with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood rates or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.
To reduce sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
As treatment options, inter alia, behavior change, cognitive behavior therapy or also medicine - classical sleeping tablets only in the exceptional case and at most for two weeks.
In Germany there is hardly asleep medicine, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, you should first contact the doctor.
It can explain with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who's supposed to get into sleeping work, and what's happening?
To study in the sleeping laboratory, for example, medical doctors advise the cause of snarchs with athemause sleeves, in healthy daily fatigue, in sleep migrators, or if you don't find the cause of sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You do not really need to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend normal day.
"Don't be a lunch sleep,' says Fietze.
After cableing you go into bed at the normal time.
In addition to the electrics of the body, you wear a nose bril, a breastguard and a fühler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping.
How can encounters handle the problems?
There are quite a lot of settle screws in which you can use for better sleep.
We know: regular sleeping and staying hours, not too long in bed, don't sleep in the day, not remote to sleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that's not useful at all.
What to have the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmingman Markus Deibler has expressed himself by Facebook for the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had first picked up Gold at the Kurzbahnweltmeisterschaften in Doha and established his first world record at the same time.
Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has protected himself via Facebook from his ex-team colleagues in criticism.
"In a country where an Olympician gets 200,000€ premium and a jungle king of 150,000€ should nobody wonder about missing medals," wrote 26-year-old at Friday on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, however, the doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries, which are very much promoted and doping in the subject of doping, so precisely or even operate.
"I don't say that the controls should be set here," he continued.
When he started a comeback, he had to have reported more than nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency of Germany (NADA).
It should also be true of countries.
"When not a certain time before WM/OS can be controlled by independent controlors of WADA/FINA, it must not be participated," the electoral Hamburger who is now engaged in an ice part.
Airport: Bands of luggage thiefs arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
Citizens of Düsseldorf's police were held on Thursday to arrest two women and two men from 50 to 61 years old.
The act suspects had committed several pockets and pockets as bands.
By 21.30 p.m., civil officials again recognized a band that was known to the police from past thief steel delicates.
The two women and two men had committed several delicates since mid- July this year, with Community, working part and particularly professional.
The specialists of the criminal commissariat 34 can demonstrate four acts that were invoked to the thieves who were invoked into Germany for criminal acts.
They had totally paid over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few Linden trees, between a rest of the headstone plasters: The Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work on the first glance, but the police are among the "birth places" of the city.
If you go along the street from east to west, you will pass on playgrounds, a freshly deleted kindergarten and a bioladen.
At the facade of a grey house, someone "heartedly!" sprayed.
Against a member who is to be removed soon, it is already built: until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rent apartments will be created here.
However, article about this "treating part of the city", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is preferred with burning cars in the last weeks.
Reason is the house number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but there are still rooms occupied in the ground floor and are used for events.
Especially the Berlin Intersenator Henkel had been expressed several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "No-Go-Zone" for police and the 94 starting point of autonomous violence.
After the spaces in the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, had been authorized with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrouilled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and held visitors from entering the house number 94.
During this time, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown householders.
On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the rape was illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers moved down under the jury of Sympathists and residents.
On this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents are walking with children, people sit on the civic stage in front of the sun's houses, others are talking about form of lateness.
A basic school and children's gardens are located directly near the house projects.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, is mainly generous from the police site.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of increasing rent and gentrification.
It doesn't sound after a cheez who would be involved in the multitude of police against vandalizing links.
The graves, which the Berlin Intersenator and the police between housebesetzers and their neighbors, do not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was in fact a traditional labor area, which has a low average income and a high risk of poverty today compared to the rest of the city.
In 1990, many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including nearly the whole Mainzer Street near the Rigaer.
While the Mainzers had been awarded under great police force in a regular street slaughter, many of the projects in Riga have been legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the part of the city has become growing as the magnetic for tourists and electoral linders from all over the world: now with them, residents from DDR times and former house occupants share their cheese.
This also makes it possible for the rentals that have increased by almost 60 percent in new rental since 2009.
Many of the newly built in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognised to a discs or freshly deleted fassades, which have been thrown by colors.
No other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injuries are almost exclusively against police.
Most of the crimes are damaged by damages that tend to meet the newly renovated and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the surrounding 94, there may not be any talk of insecurity.
As regards violence, it is beneficial: people in the 94 are their neighbors, which were certainly not.
Also the famous burning cars are no longer in the Rigaer.
For the studied architectin, her street is not a criminal burning point, on the contrary: "Here you can help each other, live together on the street and get more from one another than else".
Neugebauer is consciously drawn to the Riga road - and stay.
Therefore, it was so important for the residents to return to their streets: from the police, politics and media, who suddenly claimed the humility of the city over the July.
But in the eyes of residents such as new farmers, the street continues to take them away: by fascinating new buildings in former building holes that spoil the old residents.
"They are finally property apartments that are not interesting for many here - here live rather people who aren't so good," she says.
"I can't endorse law and destruction."
But what should you do if you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left scene were Kiez.
He who pulls up should be aware of it - just like a person who pulls into a quadrupt square that can be bad about noise.
All persons proposed by first name have asked not to be called with their right name
Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contactor in matters integration and organizer.
In addition, she is local social workers.
Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social teacher supports the Managing Team for Achim Grockenberger.
It looks as a contactor for all stakeholders: refugees, refugees' group, administration, authorities and who else mix.
Regin Kunde from the working circle indicates that the honourable authorities are more than grateful than that Deuschle is now there, the own-standing wool milk acid, which has above all a problem.
Thus, some - less spotting than prescribed to the multitude of desired task areas, as the administration wanted to postpone the body.
A administrative professional power with a talent and language talent, associated with a long-standing experience in social work, was just a self-sufficient dairy.
However, administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle says.
Above all, organization, work with people locally and also behind the scenes and network activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50-procent steel for three years.
"It was highest time," says Regine Kunde that Annika Deuschle supports honoral and head officers.
There are large and small problems, organizational, human and constitutional problems.
New containers are soon on the wash street
It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.
The municipalities shall be responsible for connecting.
They must entrust the refugees in their own or rented residential rooms.
The cost of construction, rental or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities itself.
Responsibility is changed by the Board of Lands to locals and job centres.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been designed as very difficult for some time.
The facto does not find the administration private apartments.
It doesn't work until now that one is assigned to private homes, says Deuschle.
That is why common apartments must be cultivated, as it is so beautiful.
So new containers are soon set up in the wash street.
But only with apartments it's not done.
Perspective is the keyword, regine customer and Annika Deuschle are unique.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are training places, school places, one-Euro jobs and help for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the construction station or help house masters, perform common work - and that motivates and very nicely, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the Community's work will lead to a positive external impact.
This is "no employment therapy".
However, activity does not mean just work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say deuschle and customer.
People should develop a feeling of tranquillity.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rar.
So there will also be administration and honorary.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they were desired and welcomed in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They have to explain the refugees that it is just lasting and that it can be useful to bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Those who developed the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be unnutable, he will never integrate itself.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says customer honestly, "Lets that do not go at all". The work of Deuschle and Kunde is therefore always to motivate others.
It's all the way to be a mommy task.
A difficult question: Do these two have fear of radicalisation, including in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine Kunde says very clearly, "what might call some naiv". A rest risk could and does not want to exclude it.
Sensitively, though, would be the helper already.
These incidents are also the subject of refugees.
They'd have been afraid that the attackers put them completely into disrespect.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
It is therefore necessary to look forward to the main and honourable officials locally and in the region after activities.
They always have the background that a new steal of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
This question is clearly answering, the policy is shaking.
Actually, it is unclear to put them to helpers on the spot.
"In Urbach we haven't arrived where we were looking for," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax.
Regin Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already exposed to integrate the previous people reasonablely.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Inbreakers searched for Hubschrauber
