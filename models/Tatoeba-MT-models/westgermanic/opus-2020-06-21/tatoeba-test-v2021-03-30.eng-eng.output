I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance that you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There's a big supermarket.
I suspected Tom was discouraged.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said that he knew that Mary may not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure that no one can see us?
There's no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Did he have been in touch with you?
Tom and Mary said they would be doing that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today's the twentyth of October.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary is not Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to that.
I don't have kids.
I know Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think that book isn't so interesting.
I was told that that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team will continue to get better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom certainly knows that he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom don't think Mary and I can care for ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It is a large responsibility.
I think you should turn in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
Nobody will know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise.
Tom told me he would try to do that.
Tom and Mary know that they shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that next time he travels.
I knew Tom was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I might need to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom don't know that Mary is in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom is concerned.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom would be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom said he probably wouldn't win.
It's possible Tom may not know that I'm here.
Do you think I'm strange?
Tom thinks he knows it all.
Tom said it's not going to end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The pupils did the work itself.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind.
You will stay here until you are summoned.
My daughter's being toilet trained.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could've done that.
Tom and Mary told me they felt good.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something's happened to him.
Nobody suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they never met you.
I think Tom's a pretty good painter.
I know Tom's a picky eater and rarely tries anything new.
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal.
I suspect Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston more.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know Tom knows I know how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still chatting away.
You're a nerd.
Everyone was late except me.
He couldn't resist the temptation.
Tom will probably get angry if you do that.
I accepted Tom'd agree to do that.
I'm a libertarian.
May I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom will have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing is not as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted that he was rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you shouldn't be there?
I know Tom's a little older than Mary is.
Tom didn't know anyone had been hired to kill him.
Tom told me he can't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
Tom said he thought I shouldn't have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me that he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
Is I the only one who's confused?
I know Tom's a bully.
He's a clever boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired to him.
I doubt that Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they don't plan to go anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it seems.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he never had planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom's about the same height as you are.
There's no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he's glad Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she would read the book that he would lent her.
I woke up at seven o'clock.
I could've done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't told anyone they get married.
They said they were planning to go Monday.
It's not going to be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't speak so fast, please.
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone they had to do that.
I think Tom paid way too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all out.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was busy.
I know Tom don't know that Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have chicken himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one who could, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he couldn't do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary's not awake.
Did anyone else humble Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to annoy me.
That's a error.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything he's thinking about.
We married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could have done that better.
I know Tom didn't do that correctly.
She's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary's better in French than she really is.
Tonight I'm free.
Do you think Tom would have done that?
That's his house.
I'm at home.
You don't need to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.
I thought Tom was going to do that today.
They promised they'd check it.
I'm sure Tom would have agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said that he knew that he might have to do that by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters.
Tom must have put up a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance that Tom might get hurt.
Tom said he was glad that you would.
I always knew Tom was a troublemaker.
Well I never!
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary planned to do.
I wonder if Tom's really homeick.
Tom and Mary said they can't sing well.
Tom said he thought Mary was good at French.
Tom says he'll always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in serious danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I just hardened an egg for myself.
Have you got a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary probably won't be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they were like this time of year.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him.
They say they declined that deal.
I know Tom didn't know that you couldn't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
I know Tom's a really close friend of Mary's.
I know Tom didn't know who should.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wouldn't do that?
I know that Tom wouldn't probably agree to that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You're not actually suggesting I'm going out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should have.
I don't think Tom's bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't.
I would have done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Mary swore that they would never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they couldn't allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should have left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I plan to stay at home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom's ambitious by what's going on?
We haven't yet begun fighting.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom's the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they're supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me that they were ambitious.
Tom said he thought that what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one's coming.
I thought everyone could.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said he thought Mary was studying in her bedroom.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's going to be okay.
Tom told me that it didn't matter.
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I'd forget about that.
Tom told everyone he was doing that.
They figured there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were pleased.
I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little.
I know Tom's a lot more than I am.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that that's going to happen.
I knew Tom wasn't very busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom's faster doing that than Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary may not be required to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everyone's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We walked around the lake.
I don't think it's gonna be difficult to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom's as rich as most people think he's.
You won't do anything like that.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been thirty years old today if he had not passed away last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know Tom knows that I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom's safe.
I know Tom didn't know he shouldn't be doing that here.
Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like doing that.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
You're as high as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom has already done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who had stolen Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told they had to do that.
We're better telling the others.
Why is everyone talking about Tom?
Federer held at love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them.
I know Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You're a very naughty boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pillow with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning to do that.
Tom said he wondered if Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have email.
If something sounds too good to be true, then it is probably.
Tom said he hopes you won't want to do that.
Tom said he wished he was not there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry.
We may need to be in Australia for several weeks.
I didn't have planned to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They pretend that they didn't know me.
I know Tom's a little shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I won't go to that, don't you?
Tom and Mary told me that they finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have turned back there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought that maybe you wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he had forgotten something.
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment.
I knew Tom knew who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom's a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That is not feasible with current technology.
They said they are trying to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom has already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he is not allowed to do that.
I assume you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was thirty.
You have a sense of humour.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook an umelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk more.
I wonder if we could do anything to help.
Tom said he would be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom can't.
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself.
Tom dating a girl who's three years younger than he is.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I know that Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom will like this wine.
I believe we talked on the phone.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom's a slob.
He is not a virtuoso.
I suspect Tom lied to me.
Tom will finally need to do that.
Tom told me he would call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't told Mary what he has to do.
I know Tom's a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should have stayed home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed all of us.
He is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he plans to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends are not here.
A wolf cannot be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he should have done.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom may be inclined to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't be paid.
Are you worried that that might happen?
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your truck when you leave here.
I'll see it that gets done.
I wear a kit but don't wear a tie.
I'm as tired as you.
Tom thought he might come down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have excused right away.
You're lucky you didn't get injured.
Where are Tom and Mary planning to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you certain Tom will do that?
We can't live without air.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary has always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.
All of us got into the car.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that or not.
Last night I sucked.
Tom's not very good at bowling.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wants to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you've been paying attention.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You are welcome to come with us both.
I can't believe Tom's actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he'd eat too much.
We are all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that any time soon.
Did I ever tell you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I began studying French when I was thirteen years old.
Tom said he wished he had not played chess with Mary.
I know that Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew John may not have to do that by himself.
I wonder if Tom's motivated.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you should.
I think Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did that.
I still wish you'd do that.
Mary let me know that she wasn't planning to stay very long.
I didn't know you'd be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom might be one-one.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very busy.
I'm absolutely certain that's not going to happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they need to find someone to help them do that.
You're very annoying.
I have already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You finished your homework, didn't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not.
I lost in the forest.
I know Tom's a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'll be in Boston next Monday.
Keep your mouth shut!
Tom said he knew he might need to do that on Monday.
Tom said he regretted what happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary that he had to do that.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Have you got a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents won't allow me to do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it'll take for him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why didn't you eat the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried on his father's clothes.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom said he's trying to do that every week.
You really have beautiful teeth! Are they real?
No one knew Tom was the person who contributed most of the money.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was frustrated.
Tom and I were both a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew that's going to happen.
Tom told me he thought he could.
I admitted what Tom said I shouldn't do.
Did you know that Tom and Mary have three children?
It's not just a smaller problem.
I am not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's already done that.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason that Tom is not here.
It's not right to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me that he thought Mary could run faster than he could.
Tom said Mary's frightened.
You should have been the last to do that.
I know Tom's a farmer, but I don't know where his farm it is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like to do that.
What could go wrong?
No one could have stopped that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I said I would, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom's overemotional.
I'm immune to small pox.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my couch.
My class was canceled.
Tom and Mary told me that when they got here.
Tom promised me he'd be here by 2:30.
Tom said he thinks Mary can take care of herself.
It's not as cold here as I expected to be.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'll be alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to start.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.
I think Tom won't be surprised.
I know that Tom would be willing to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was jealous.
Does anyone else know you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to thezoo.
Tom said he thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I know Tom knew who would do that for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary is not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can't do this without Tom.
Tom said that he didn't think the noise smelled Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows we.
Tom said he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he might not need to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said that he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom will get lost.
They told me they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't sticky.
I know Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they ate too much.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door.
I know that Tom's afraid people might laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was probably still mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate foreigners; I hate everyone.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can swim.
I don't know if Tom will come tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a larger place.
I think Tom's the only one who has to do that.
I didn't think you would win.
I don't think Tom will have the time to do that with us today.
I know that Tom is very opinioned.
We can't let these upsets push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who's Mary's boyfriend.
I knew Tom knew who could do that and who couldn't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everyone here knows that we don't eat pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know that you shouldn't have done that.
I think Tom don't know how to do that.
I've already told Tom that I don't plan to do that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not healthy to skip meals.
I'm glad to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I suspect Tom and Mary are those who did that.
I bet I can sit here longer without saying something than you can.
It's not yet done.
I know Tom's not on the team anymore.
I know Tom don't know he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom just turned on the radio.
Tom has already decided that he's not going to say yes.
I know Tom is a little snobbish.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would have done that by himself if he could have.
Advising that there is a problem is the first step to fix the problem.
Mary said she was planning to go.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be absent.
Tom said that Mary lied.
I don't think Tom would be upset if I did.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't be there.

I don't have to do anything I don't want to.
Tom and Mary weren't planning to do that until John asked them to.
If you left home a little earlier you would have been on time.

What are the positive sides?
The battery indicator light shows that the battery is not charged.

They are fascinated by blood and violence.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want this.
No one knows exactly where Tom will go.

Some think it's a bad idea.
How do I know you won't try to kill me?

That's not what Tom really needs.

This is the first time I've been away from my family for more than three weeks.
You should have said that at that time.

I've parked my car here many times and nobody's complained.
Tom said he was sad.

I know I'm gonna regret this.
Tom thought Mary was bored.

Do you have any idea when Tom's planning here?
I know you don't plan to stay in Boston.
I wonder if that could happen again.
I suspect Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I couldn't stay looking at it.
I think Tom doesn't know Mary can't speak French.
The currently available evidence does not allow me to make such a claim.
Tom said he's very sure Mary has to do that.
Tom would have been happy if you had done that.
Tom said he wants to talk to you.
I thought you were a doctor.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom said he needed to stay home.
I thought you were happy.

I never thought I would go there.
You know that's not true.
I know Tom and Mary have already left Australia.
You're not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they felt the same.
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
Tom has decided that he's not going to work today.
Tom denied that he was the one who asked Mary to do that.
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
It's not going to work out.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said Mary thought John may not be allowed to do that.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom told Mary and I that we should try to do that by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I wouldn't have been able to do that without your help.
I knew Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.
Tom said he looked forward to his retirement.
Whether we do that now or later does not matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should have expected Tom wouldn't come along with Mary.
I think it's very unlikely that Tom wasn't aware that he wouldn't be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
I wonder if Tom really knows the combination with this safe.
Someone singing.
Mary doesn't plan to do that until I tell her.
I didn't know you should do that this afternoon.
Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
I didn't realize Tom didn't like Mary.
I don't think that can't be fixed.
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know.
Tom didn't even know that Mary used to live in Boston.
I didn't know you needed to do that today.
You should have invoked your children months ago.
I think that's not mine.
I believe Tom is thirty years old.
Think about it.

Are you sure Mary said she was planning to do that tomorrow?
There were times I would have been lost without Tom.

I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote in all caps.
Tom will be very happy he didn't do that.

Is that not what you'd have done?

Yet, every so often, the oath is taken at the top of gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not just because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We have remained faithful to the ideals of our preemers, and true to our founding documents.

They say they would be willing to help us.
It's not open for debate.
Tom told everyone he was unemployed.
I know that'll be hard to do.
How do you plan to do that?
It's beyond me.
I'm a little out of shape!
Didn't you know Tom saw someone else?
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were cute.
I thought you had learned that by now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom's just as smart as Mary.
They wished they hadn't said that.
I wonder if Tom's planning to quit his job.
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be motivated to do that.
I'm gonna go crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad no one's around.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know Tom will probably know how to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be grimmy.
I know Tom knows why we didn't do that on Monday.
Who is your favorite singer?
I promise you I'll help you.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not want to do that again.
Tom thinks he left his truck on the train.
I'm a lot more than Tom.
I know Tom can speak French.
I know that Tom would be faster doing that than Mary.
My handwriting is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected Tom was a little paranoid.
I know Tom knew that I was planning to do that.
You should have been able to do that much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you weren't those who did that.
Tom said he didn't have the power to stop it.
I know that Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's the reason Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I got married.
Tom told me he would probably cry.
I thought they would find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew that Tom didn't want to do that.
I doubt very seriously that Tom did that in purpose.
I thought you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do that by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something the other night about that.
Tom admitted he wasn't brave.
I know I should have done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston any longer.
I suspect Tom's waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't bite.
I don't think Tom's as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
She avoided his eyes.
Tom's not as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can't do that by yourself.
Tom says Mary's still planning to do that.
I thought Tom must be wrong.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason why Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary looks forward to being retired.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fallen in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about that.
Tom's loved by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you're mad.
He hasn't got a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John may not be allowed to do that by himself.
Tom has no need to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom is involved.
How many kilograms have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are okay.
I'm a despicable human being.
I'll never forget the time you and I went to Australia together.
Tom isn't the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he's sleepy.
Mary tried on her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle.
I prided off the deck.
Tom said Mary was likely to be in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you are.
When is your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary wait for someone.
I would have helped you.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary are saying they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun to do that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a diet for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary already had a driver's license.
I know Tom's a fairly good drummer.
Tom realized that he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should've done that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weathervan.
Didn't you know Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny more.
I suspect Tom's at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they would do that again.
Tom threw up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to be married to Tom.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned.
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted.
Tom said he's a Canadian.
I would like to have another cup of coffee.
I presume Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everybody he knows enjoying doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know Tom can probably do that sometime today.
Do you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary's gone.
Tom doubts that Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the bureau.
I think Tom's unkind.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it true Tom moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia any more.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary that.
I'm interested in Chess these days.
I don't think I would like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done that by herself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was misled.
What you say is absolutely wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary is thirsty.
They said they didn't enjoy doing that.
I'm peeling apples.
They said they would never study French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me he's uncertain what he should do.
Tom told me I should have said yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the refrigerator.
Tom said that he knew that Mary may not need to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance that I'll get there at time.
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
Tom said that he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he didn't plan to go with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom's sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everyone loves free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will also.
I know Tom's still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they're ready to help me.
Tom isn't the one who told me that Mary should do that.
I thought you said you would still like to do that.
Tom said he wondered if Mary wanted to do that or not.
They say they're not planning to go.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said that it was Mary who told him that he should do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary is annoyed.
I don't think I can hold on much longer.
Tom's not as high as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat beat Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom that I was disagree.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
I believe that everyone is deserving a chance.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting.
Tom don't know I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to call attention to that.
Tom said he knew that Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said Australia is a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in big trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder if Tom's alive.
I might try to lend a hatchet from Tom.
Tom might be surprised.
I don't think anyone would want to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I think Tom won't be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he would never be coming back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do that by yourself.
I suspect Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom's inadequate.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know Tom's more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something illegal.
Our streets flood when we have rain.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have a lot of choice.
Tom said he thought he could do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew Tom may be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know Tom's a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has an idea of what Tom could.
Tom knew he could have done that better.
Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that by herself anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was displeased.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know Tom is the one who should tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by yourself.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know Tom can't stop doing that.
I can assure you that won't happen.
Tom plans to sit in the back.
Tom said he would have given a book to Mary.
It would have been indifferent.
I know Tom will probably know how to do that.
I know Tom was a screamy kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly to blame.
I'm not surprised that Tom plans to do that.
Nobody expected Tom to win.
Don't doubt my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job was going to be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put on your jacket if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he was not planning on staying in Australia very long.
I hear you've given up smoke.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes to do that very much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said that Mary knew John may have to do that by himself.
Tom said he was good to speak French.
This is not salt.
Did anyone see Tom here?
Tom told me that he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room I do.
He didn't keep his word.
I know that that's not true.
Tom said he's planning to do that.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary had been careful.
Tom was asleep on the living room sofa.
I found both Tom and Mary like romance novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I suspect Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone he was ready to do that.
We'll go on a picnic if it's fine tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone
It's not Tom who needs protection.
They said they're irritated.
I think Tom will probably be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said that their houses weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things we should do now.
I think Tom and Mary have been at Boston at least one time.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should quit being sleepy.
Can anyone please help me?
I know Tom's about the same age as your daughter.
I know Tom's a very happy guy.
Tom thought I may not be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's easy.
I think Tom will be one-one.
It seems like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary's got to put into her new flat.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that.
They swore that they would never do that.
Everyone stood there, shocked.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I'm sorry I wasn't as careful as I should have been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary is sleepy or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did that, weren't you?
They wished they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I saw Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary by now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just take Tom's guilty.
Watch yourself.
Mary said she wasn't planning to do that.
Somebody has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know Tom did that when he was thirteen.
Tom said he didn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
Enough is enough!
I wondered if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know that Tom did that?
I think it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It is not until you have lost your health that you realize its value.
That could have hit me.
They told me they lose weight.
My house is not big.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I was planning to join the team, did you?
The bathroom was not very clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he didn't think he would ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary would be the first to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wished he could speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom has no prayer.
Tom said he thought you could care for yourself.
I know that Tom knew I was the one who had to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I left my truck in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I suspect Tom would be interested in doing that.
I promised Tom that I would.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Courgettes are green.
I should never have broken up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom tossed his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you tell me the truth?
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
That's just not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom says that he and Mary will spend Christmas Day together.
Why did you fail in the entrance examination?
Tom found it hard to stay impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were bored.
Tom said he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really meant.
I know that there will be a lot of good food at the picnic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I suspect Tom is reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they would rather come next week.
What do you refer to?
Tom said he thought Mary was amused by what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They are inseparable.
Tom didn't know you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should have expected that to happen.
It would have been wise to do that.
Tom told me he didn't have a problem with that.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have walked home by herself.
Tom has to be irritated.
For how long has your head been hurt?
Thanks, Bud!
Tom said nobody was fired.
Do you think we should have gone to where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He has earache.
I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
I'm supposed that the gun shot I heard was the one who killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know Tom's a millionaire.
Tom said he thought that doing that would be safe.
I don't think I'll allow Tom to do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit that I've done that.
I think Tom don't eat meat.
I hope we don't have problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the noise.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom's a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I think Tom won't be the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom's downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that.
I realize that that isn't very likely to happen.
They say that drugs are not safe.
I know that it's highly unlikely anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said that he thought it would be a huge mistake to tell Mary what happened.
Tom thought Mary would probably not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never have happened if you would do what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a kleenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could become a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom's a hemophiliac.
I wouldn't have said anything.
Tom said he would be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I still accept you enjoy drinking bear.
I wonder if Tom and Mary could.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom's the person you should talk to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study French.
You're not obliged to do that, are you?
You've got a big head.
He's very smart.
I would never have hired Tom.
Does Tom know that you already done that?
Tom ate more than I ate.
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could.
Tom said Mary is probably still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought I would want to do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary will get hurt if they're not careful.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that.
I would like to visit Boston again.
With teaching and studying my time is taken up.
I think Tom's conceited.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that.
They say they'll quit doing that.
Tom's incompetent.
Tom thinks Mary drinks like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said he thinks Mary can't do that.
I know Tom's a golfer, maybe he could teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew Tom would be able to do that without some help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter.
What else do you plan to do?
I think Tom understood everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom's speaking.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I'd like you to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew Tom wasn't a bad student.
It's unlike Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite?
Tom don't know I have three cats.
I should have stopped while I was ahead.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother texts faster than you.
Do Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you would do that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone noticed what you did.
I wonder if I could help Tom.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this is not hard.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I assumed Tom had told you I would be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
Tom said he didn't know that Mary would eventually leave him.
You're not still afraid, are you?
I thought you cried.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You will suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it will cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know Tom's nice.
Tom already knows Mary's planning on that.
Don't take off your gloves.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wasn't going to do that again.
Tom should have been able to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary was feeling sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should've done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pets on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know Tom isn't the one who's supposed to do that.
I admit I've despised Tom since the first time I met him.
Are there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the television guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is round.
Tom couldn't help smile.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well.
Check out that girl.
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be disabled.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
Tom thinks that's a error.
I knew Tom was a reasonable guy.
Tom thought Mary was down.
I didn't want to admit that I couldn't do that.
Tom said he was ready to do whatever was necessary.
Tom said he owe Mary a lot of money.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you.
It's not safe to go out after dark by yourself.
Did you know Tom had a son?
Tom knows Mary likes Boston.
Tom and Mary said they're not likely to win.
Tom told me he would have been forgiven.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there is only one course of action possible.
Tom and Mary said they tried very hard to win.
They say they lost their keys.
I've decided never to do that again.
I didn't know you were dating Tom.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary that they're not required to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know Tom don't know he shouldn't be doing that today.
Tom and Mary say they didn't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
Don't you know that everyone talks about us?
Tom said that Mary knew he didn't want to do that until next Monday.
I know Tom's house's for sale.
I don't think Tom's sad.
I don't think Tom will really win.
I wanted to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was strict.
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that by herself.
We wish we could have done more to help.
Tom said he thought it would snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said he would look at it.
Tom said to do that was more difficult than he thought it would be.
You would've loved the movie.
They told me they don't really care what happens.
Tom's speech wasn't as long as Mary's.
I didn't know that Tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry, I swore you.
Everyone seems to be afraid but you.
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
Was the book you read yesterday in French?
I'm a damage doer.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could have gone.
Tom said he didn't think the smell smelled Mary.
He thinks I love her.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.
I'm glad to see that Tom's happy again.
I thought Tom had left already.
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to keep Mary doing that.
I don't think we have a lot of time.
Tom said he tried to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would have done that for me.
Tom's the funnyst person I've ever met.
I doubt Tom really plans to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary may not have to do that this week.
I know Tom knows that he didn't need to do that.
To tell the truth, I am not your father.
I don't think Tom will be doing that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it?
I thought you could walk Mary home.
Tom said that he hopes Mary tries to do that.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
Tom says he knows Mary cannot speak French very well.
Tom didn't tell me where he's planning to stay in Boston.
Tom didn't have to come here, he could just have called.
They said they enjoyed the challenge.
I know Tom was late.
Tom told me he was going home.
Tom told me he had lost his textbook.
Nobody knew Tom's going to do that.
That's right!
I thought I might need to do that.
I'm fairly sure Tom doesn't have any siblings.

I didn't want to admit that I was the one who broke the window.

You don't leave Japan for good, are you?
I wonder if Tom's really going to do that today.
How did you know I was going to say that?
I don't think Tom knows anyone in Boston.
Does Tom really think Mary enjoy doing that?
I don't eat anything for the last three days.
I thought you said no one would be here.
We haven't been told yet.

Tom and Mary took their gloves off.
We're apt to make mistakes.

They told everyone that they were one-one.
We have to escape this place.
Tom would like to be here.
You should have worked harder.
I'm surprised Tom didn't show.

I'm going to New York next week.
This is an unusually difficult language.

Last night I sucked.
Everyone here except me did that.

I didn't notice that Tom was doing that.
Tom is about three years older than Mary.

Tom's gonna be surprised if you don't do that.
Tom knew Mary was with John.
I promise I'll be back soon.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have stayed at the party so long.

Tom don't want Mary to know that he doesn't know how to do that.

Call me!
You should have told Tom how you felt.
We will consider your proposal.
Eating too much is bad for health.
The paint's drying.
Tom may be lost.

Hi, my name's Tom!

Who are you calling stupid?

I doubt you will be happy with my report.
I should have known that Tom would do that.
Tom told me he used to live in Australia.
I'm glad you've succeeded.
It won't take less than one hour to go there.
I knew Tom wouldn't pass the exam.
You may use my bureau if you want.
I think Tom would agree with me.
Don't stay too long!
I know Tom's popular.
It makes sense.
Tom said he really did that without anyone's help.
I wonder if Tom's ready to do that.
I don't think Tom would care if you did that today.
I know Tom used to be a speech coach.
He can't swim a miles.
Tom said he's probably not going to do that.
Tom said Mary was upset.
I don't think Tom is a good lawyer.
Tom's gonna have to figure it out.
Are you absolutely sure Tom has to do that?
They said they hope it will happen soon.
Tom said he's not used.
I thought I didn't have anything to lose.
By day breaking the storm was over.
No one I really want to do that.
I think Tom expects someone to make dinner for him.
They said they don't want to do that.
The price of gasoline is so high that we cannot buy a large car.
Why didn't you tell me you knew how to do that already?
Tom told me he hoped Mary would be discreet.
"Thanks." "What for?" "For everything."
You're a teacher.
Many men, many minds.
Anything is possible.
Tom and Mary told me that they were displeased.
Tom and Mary say they need to do that.
Let's hope that never happen again.
I don't think that actually happened.
Tom said Mary was arrested before.
Tom said Mary's not ready.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
Tom had trouble admitting he was wrong.
I thought you might want to play a chess game.
Tom said he thought Mary would be impressed.
I know that it's highly unlikely anyone knows me.
Tom said he wasn't sure he could.
Are you going to be okay?
They told me they were famed.
I thought something was seriously wrong with Tom.
Tom said he's not sleepy yet.
Tom assumed that everyone knew that Mary was going to do that.
I know that Tom probably shouldn't do that anymore.
I had no idea Tom could do that.
It looks like Tom's waiting for someone.
Tom said he thought Mary probably had a good time in Boston.
You broke the computer.
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
They say they like studying French.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's favorite flower is.
I knew Tom was ready to do that.
I suspect Tom will probably do that.
Tom said he was going to stay up all night.
I didn't know Tom was a veteran.
I thought this was what you wanted me to buy.
My daughter often experienced asthma attacks as a child.
I knew Tom didn't know that you were the one who had done that.
We've already met everyone.
Tom said there were still a lot of things left to do.
You don't have a chance.
If Tom had enough money, he would have gone to Boston with Mary.
Tom told everyone he was glad that that was going to happen.
You're always doubting my word.
I didn't know I couldn't do what Tom asked me to do.
There's a good chance we'll win.
Tom says he knows Mary can win.
I know that Tom is not a baseball fan.
I knew Tom would ask Mary to do that.
I think Tom shouldn't agree to that.
I don't think Tom has sold anything every day.
I think I'm too old for her.
I don't think I should have left early.
I didn't say I was going to Australia.
Tom should have stayed in Boston for a few more days.
I should have told Tom sooner.
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that.
Tom will remember.
It's not something I think I can do.
Tom told me where he was planning to stay.
I know you're not planning to stay in Australia.
I know Tom was impolite.
Do you have a pencil I can lend?
Tom also wanted to do that.
I could have done that for you.
I think Tom's home.
It is an agonizing for America to lose our young men and women.
Tom should do everything they're telling him.
Everyone but Tom knew he didn't have to go to Australia.
What is the most beautiful place in the world?
The storm caused a lot of damage to the crop.
I don't think everyone has given up.
Let's get our photo taken.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
Suddenly all the lights went out.
Tom and Mary said they will probably win.
I think Tom'd be annoyed if you did.
Tom and Mary thought they would find other jobs.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I suspect Tom and Mary were planning to do that tomorrow.
I didn't know you knew how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to be doing this.
I know Tom's doing that well.
Tom said nothing had changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know Tom knows that I needed to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know Tom's afraid he'll get fired.
If I were you I would call the doctor.
I didn't feel very hungry.
I've done everything you asked me to do.
Do you have a tits I could borrow?
I didn't think we would find anyone who could for us.
Tom isn't angel.
I think Tom's mad.
That sounds awesome.
Tom's driving over to Mary's apartment to give her something.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said that he didn't think that the smell smelled Mary.
Tom said he's willing to do that for us.
Can you believe Tom's only thirteen?
Tom sent Mary his picture.
Tom already knows that Mary doesn't plan to be here today.
They say they never eat Thai food.
I think Tom and Mary have never been to Boston.
They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone singing.
I heard Tom plans to move to Australia.
It's not as hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I'm here.
No one saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran back home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know that you're not wronging me for someone else?
You should have refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm beginning to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston more.
Tom should never have been imprisoned.
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said Mary thought that John might be required to do that by himself.
I know what I'd do.
He didn't need to bring the truck.
Both Tom and Mary weren't at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I need to do that today.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me you were with him yesterday afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know we were those who should.
I'm so tired that I can hardly walk.
They felt that they needed to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but don't speak.
You set a trap.
I should have added more salt.
I know that is not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married.
I think Tom's smashed.
Tom and Mary never say they will.
I think Tom's sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could have got home by himself.
Both Tom and Mary know who you are.
Mary said she didn't plan to do that by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were unpressed.
Tom hasn't told us what he needs to do.
I know you probably didn't need to do that.
I wonder if Tom remembers where we met.
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he would expect Mary to get back to Boston on October 20th.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do that again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the Bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew Tom told Mary that he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize that they are ignored.
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would have been here by now.
Tom and Mary said they would.
There's no doubt Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Tom said he thought I seemed unconcerned.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I would be able to do that.
I figured Tom would panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it will snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom's pleased.
I'm frightening fish.
The wind calm down in the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that by now if he was really planning to do it.
I know Tom could do that if he really needed to.
We'll never know.
Tom admitted that he had killed Mary.
Did you not know that your spheres weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom's never gonna hurt anyone again.
I am learning Esperanto very quickly.
You're not gonna get into trouble for helping me, are you?
I've heard that women spend more on shoes than men.
I think Tom will be excited.
We'll land in 15 minutes.
Tom said he would care for Mary.
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants to do.
I thought you'd be fixing that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told he will not be allowed to do that.
They say they're unsure.
I know Tom didn't know he wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom should have told me earlier.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologized to each other.
You don't do anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will actually do that.
They say that they also need to do that.
I know Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they would help me.
I don't think I'll ever be able to pay for a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they snare.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tom said he'd found something.
A business is not a charity.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever been to Australia.
I don't think Tom's as good looking like John.
Tom said he thought that prices at that store were too high.
I don't think any disputes that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he hoped he would be able to do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unaware.
I'm sorry, it happened like this.
I know Tom's not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me if I liked it or not.
Many old people in these days can't keep up with the times.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he decided to do that.
It's a kind of cat.
Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Tom denied that he had accepted the letters.
Tom said he thought that doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
Couldn't this wait until tomorrow?
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
We know that won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared histhroat loudly.
I think Tom is unprejudicated.
I'm afraid I've lost it.
Tom said Mary was likely to be grumpy.
We're both adults.
They are not as weak as they used to be.
I know Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do that today.
Don't talk about business while we're eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard.
I hope Tom gets adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She's got to be taken to the hospital.
I would have helped you if you had asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a weight.
This is not a drill.
Tom should have done that a long time ago.
I think Tom slept every afternoon.
I wonder if Tom's upset.
Tom said that he knew that they couldn't let him do that at school.
Tom said that he hopes Mary likes to do that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if he had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something's still not right.
Are you mad?
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I know Tom doesn't plan to Boston with you.
Tom said that he's not sure Mary has to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be able to talk to Mary about that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary intend to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said he thought he would be fun.
I think you'll discover that it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was rather ingenious.
Do you know if Tom and Mary's going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were those who did that?
Are you still planning to do that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know what time you said you'd be there, but I couldn't be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that that's not true.
Let's assume that will happen.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was truthful.
It's quite likely Tom will come.
I doubt Tom'll come to Boston this year.
I didn't think anyone had tried that before.
You should have made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning to go.
Tom said it looked like Mary had a really hard time to do that.
I'm learning Old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could've done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was difficult to get along with.
They said they were very drunk.
You could have told me earlier.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was concealed.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know Tom never does that anymore.
Tom says that he only swears when it is absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom's high.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
Tom said that he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me that he thought this book was interesting.
Tom assumed everyone knew that he couldn't do that.
Tom said he was planning to go on October 20th.
They said they're just doing fine.
Hostities resumed between the two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone else did in his family.
I would have done that if I could have.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning to do that.
Tom assumed that everyone at school knew he was arrested.
Tom wished he knew how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he's seen Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to do that.
I think Tom is the one who should tell Mary to do that.
Everyone knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My findings suggest that it is not the case.
Tom found the watch he had lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must have left the window open.
I know Tom's a brilliant person.
I'm sorry, sir, there must have been some mistake.
I know Tom knew Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just standing the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he would be able to do that in a few hours.
No doubts that you will be able to pass the examination.
Where's everyone?
How have you been feeling?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom had heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope no one's coming.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that for them if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said he would walk Mary home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should have hired someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unpressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me he was too tired to study.
Where's your luggage?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that isn't true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom's going to be willing to talk to me.
Tom said he's glad Mary could win.
I didn't think you would be able to get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, much less German.
Tom thought something bad would happen.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I know that it's very unlikely anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I enjoy both playing fullyball.
It's not likely Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
Tom said he couldn't win.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that any time soon.
There's a possibility Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
She's a blond girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing Mary did.
I know Tom's a sophomore.
Tom certainly knew he shouldn't have eaten that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said Mary knew John may not have to do that until Monday.
Tom shouldn't have ever tried to do that by himself.
How's your dad?
My son is not a snob.
I would have let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was more difficult than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary wants to do that alone.
I wonder if it'll really be hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said that Mary knew she couldn't have to do that again.
They swore that they wouldn't do that again.
I don't really plan to do that.
I know Tom will allow you to do that.
Tom said that Mary would.
They said they won't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said that he thought there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't done that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would.
Tom said he thought Mary was over thirty.
We went up by two floors to reach the apparel stales.
I don't think Tom's funny.
Tom thinks he's gonna die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they would be happy to help.
Tom and I want to go both.
I didn't know you would tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I would be able to do that for Tom.
Tom promised that he would never make such a mistake.
Don't you think we should have talked to Tom about this?
Tom told me that he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me he thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the small stuff.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it's a very common problem.
Are you sure this will work?
I'm afraid I'll be fastened all afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seem to be unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said Mary thought he might need to do that.
Tom said he wouldn't ever try to do that again.
I don't think it's ever working.
Don't forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom gave me a lot of things.
I know Tom's a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom admitted that he lied to me.
Tom and Mary told John they don't plan to stay at home all day.
Tom don't know I still have this.
We're not quite sure what we're supposed to be doing.
We love both Tom.
Tom said he hopes you're trying to do that.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that this evening.
I don't think I know the man who plays the drums.
This old man has liver spots on his skin.
Tom and Mary vodden they would never do that.
Give me that candle.
Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he needed to do.
There's no time to explain.
Tom didn't realize he had to leave.
They said they were afraid.
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
You're comparing apps and oranges!
Tom said there was still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed.
Tom said he thought he'd be arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were worried out.
I've heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to see Mary more.
They live in a fantasy world.
They said they thought I'm charming.
I didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have a lot of fun to do that.
I suspect Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to.
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that.
I plan to skip lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him to.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was afraid.
Tom has already told me that he's decided to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they die.
Tom offered me some money.
Do you think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea that Mary didn't know what she was doing.
Tom told everyone he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a French speaker.
They said they weren't planning to go.
They say they have taught French.
I suspect Tom and Mary are curious.
I know Tom knows that I don't need to do that.
You need to help Tom.
Tom told us he had a headache.
The bomb was defused just minutes before it would have exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they would win, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary say they don't know French.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should have refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary.
Tom said that is not the main reason why Mary should do that.
Tom has no car and neither does Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he was not different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could have been afraid.
Who do you think you asked me to give this to you?
I've just been sick.
I hope I get a raise.
Tom said he didn't think we should even consider doing that.
Tom said he would have come if we invited him.
I don't think I'll probably do that.
Tom said he might cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he wasn't tired.
I didn't think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
I think you know we need to do that today.
I didn't think Tom would actually do that.
I knew Tom would leave early.
Tom said he thought Mary understood French.
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him.
I don't think anyone's alive in this house for a long time.
Tom denied he stole the money.
Tom said he didn't decide what he'll do.
Everyone knew Tom didn't like to go to Boston.
Tom said he thought that tomorrow would be a sunny day.
Tom's obviously drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that that's not going to happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you had promised to give that to Tom.
I thought you said you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they had completely recovered.
I didn't know that you weren't planning to do that by yourself.
I don't think there's any way out of here.
There's no rose without a thorn.
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know John spoke French.
You know I wouldn't do that.
I think we all know that that's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
Tom was probably about 13 years old at the time.
Tom and Mary said they were sticky.
Tom said he wouldn't be able to help wearing the garden today.
I wondered how Tom knew I would be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was meant.
So, where's the problem?
Tom didn't think Mary was beautiful.
He will have to do that task again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who could.
Only fresh vegetation is sold here.
I believe this is not a good idea.
Tom has already been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
When was the last time you asked someone for help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
I know Tom's irritated.
I didn't meet anyone new today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was planning to do that.
Tom and I don't both speak French.
I thought you'd be ready.
I know Tom knew why Mary didn't like to do that.
I didn't think Tom was glad that happened.
They said they were very tired.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license, are you?
I don't think there's any harm now in telling you.
I thought you said that you did that on Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom is in Boston.
Tom denied Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Austria is a parliamentary republic in mid-Europe and consists of nine federal countries.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they're not thirty yet.
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was back.
Tom said Mary knew she may not be allowed to do that unless John did it with her.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were pleased.
Tom said Mary thought John might be required to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I thought Mary was cut.
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to do that by herself.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy.
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he would pay for everything.
They told me they weren't alone.
I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary's not safe.
Tom said I looked thinner than the last time he saw me.
They said they would see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was concerned.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's going to do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be cooperative.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be afraid.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
I knew Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him to.
We can't pretend Tom is normal.
Tom's amused.
Tom should never try to do that alone.
Tom and Mary said they would never do that.
I'm much more than him.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was conservative.
Tom said he thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that on a cold day like today.
The teachers' room and the gym are under renovation.
Do you think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom put his glass down.
You would think that would have impressed Tom.
This is the first time I bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we can't exist.
Tom certainly understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
Tom and Mary say they didn't agree to that.
I know that Tom will be able to help us do that.
I had lunch three hours ago.
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You are the only one that can protect them.
Can anyone explain this to me?
Did you know Tom was going to be in Boston all week?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
I know Tom didn't know that I wasn't going to do that.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom has a lot of things he needs to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There is no logical reason for this.
I suspected Tom was insected.
I hope I gave you enough money to buy everything you needed.
Tom said that he didn't think Mary enjoyed doing that.
They said they were feeling fine.
I wish you didn't see me doing that.
Tom and Mary said they had no money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom should never have had that job.
Tom told Mary that she was his only one.
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled.
Tom was convinced that Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said he knew that was what Mary had to do.
I think you're terrified.
I wonder if Tom's going to Boston next week.
Tom said he didn't know Mary wouldn't go to Australia unless he went with her.
I know Tom doesn't want to do that.
You're not an idiot.

Tom said that he knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary wasn't mad.
I think we bought everything we need.

Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom's average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said he knew that Mary might be required to do that by herself.
I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It's not a watch.
Tom and Mary said they're inadequate.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom seems to be unwilling to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said Mary wouldn't like to do that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom's homeick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can't do that by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary would probably not do that.
I thought you said we weren't going to do that anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who can do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you might be the only person who would listen to me.
I know that Tom didn't know Mary did that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous.
That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me they were unambiguous.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be excited about that.
I didn't know I was supposed to help Tom do that.
No matter what you say, I am convinced that I am right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We cannot make a change in our schedule.
I was shocked when I heard Tom had been arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they shouldn't park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really gonna kill Tom, are you?
They said they would be willing to help us.
Tom told me that he would.
Tom is not the same as he was thirty years ago.
I don't think there's any point to discuss this today.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary she needs to do that today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they're disappointed.
It is not always easy to distinguish good from evil.
Tom said he's gonna try something he's never done before.
I don't think Tom's strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
I suspect Tom and Mary are suspicious.
You're a prude.
Tom said he would have done that if he could have.
I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
Tom said he wished he kissed Mary goodnight.
If you do, I will too.
I think Tom's irreplaceable.
They told me that they're tempted to do that.
I don't think I have everything I need.
That's not what Tom wanted you to do.
What book did you give to Tom?
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last year.
Tom and Mary say they hope they can do that.
I know Tom expected me to do that.
I wonder if Tom's ever been to Boston.
It's not quite finished.
Tom said he felt frustrated.
I know Tom will do that with Mary.
I sent Mary some roses.
Tom said Mary was much more than her sister.
I wasn't as hungry like Tom.
Will you ile me your dictionary?
I buy things I know I'm not going to use.
Tom claims he didn't kill anyone.
Tom and Mary said they were very grateful.
How are you doing today?
Tom said Mary wanted to do that yesterday.
Tom told me that he won't do that.
I know Tom's a lot stronger than I am.
It was not a easy decision.
I wonder if I'm still able to do that.
I knew Tom didn't want me to do that.
Tom didn't tell anything.
It's Tom's thirtyth birthday tomorrow.
Tom said he didn't think Mary did really what John said she did.
Tom and Mary said they were Canadian.
They hoped they would be able to win.
Tom said he was glad that Mary could do that.
I should have told you everything earlier.
I thought you had another reason.
I think you shouldn't have bought that car.
Tom told Mary that he was unwilling to do that.
I should have known Tom would be busy.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was thirty.
Tom said he heard someone calling.
Tom told me he thought Mary had to do that.
Tom thought I didn't have to do that.
Nobody asked for your help.
I thought Tom did that yesterday.
Tom was not allowed to board the plane because he did not hold a valid travel document.
Something's not right.
Tom believes Mary's trying to discredit him.
Tom didn't seem too angry.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't doing that yet.
I think Tom won't be early.
Tom told me Mary was nervous.
Samurai lived by a code of honor.
I know Tom doesn't know when I did that.
Tom said Mary has been here before.
I can't believe Tom actually did that.
I don't think I've bought everything I need.
Tom said he didn't have anything to do.
I should have noticed it before.
I thought Tom would ask Mary not to do that.
I wonder if Tom wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought we might have a problem.
It rained for three days straight.
Tom thought Mary was pregnant.
When was Tom the first time?
Do you know if Tom and Mary are allowed to do that?
We told everyone we were moving to Australia.
Please do that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
I don't think Tom's married anymore.
Tom said he thought Mary would be alone.
Everyone knows Tom and I don't like each other.
I'll see you tomorrow.
They say they were hungry.
Tom said he should have done that.
Tom was creamed.
Tom said he thought Mary had already done that.
Tom told me he thought he could.
I suspect Tom is still in love with his ex-wife.
I know Tom knew that Mary was the one who had to do that.
Tom waits very rarely for anyone.
I just assumed that everyone would do that.
I don't think you understand what this means.
It is not possible.
I don't think you have the goods.
I've been busy since yesterday.
Tom said I shouldn't have tried to do that by myself.
Tom said he wished he had not tried to do that.
Tom was the one who told me I needed to do that.
I didn't think we could get home by 2:30.
Tom said he couldn't sleep last night.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was creative.
Tom could have come yesterday, but he didn't.
I didn't know Tom didn't want to do that alone.
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
I wonder if Tom could do that by himself.
Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't done it.
I suspect Tom will probably have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not as busy now as I was this time last year.
I would have talked to Tom instead of ignoring him.
I thought you'd like to meet my family.
I don't think Tom will be obedient.
Tom said he was going to do that every day after he retired.
There is not much I can do to help, I am afraid.
Both Tom and Mary are still not married.
I know Tom knew that Mary couldn't do that.
We're together at school.
I would like you to look at these documents.
Tom's tired.
Tom said he didn't need an lawyer.
Tom and Mary said they would go by train.
I didn't know Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.

I know Tom's grousy.
Tom has passed out.
Doing that would be hard.

I thought Tom lived in Australia.
I'm very surprised Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom doesn't think you're gonna be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he'd be arrested.
I don't think Tom's available.
I don't think Tom's doing that.
I wonder if Tom's interested.
I don't think Tom like the song you wrote about him.
I think I'll take this tie.
Tom thought he might not be required to do that by himself.
I know Tom don't know that Mary has never done that before.
Tom gave me all the money I asked for.
Tom said Mary knew John might want to do that by himself.
The wood has become satisfactory with water.
I don't think Tom understood.

I thought it'd be clear in the afternoon.

He's a very affectionate father.
How did Tom know Mary would do that?
Tom told me he was in a lot of trouble.
Tom thinks it will rain tomorrow.
I didn't know Tom owned a gun.
I thought there was a good chance that Tom would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would want your old bicycle.

You cannot buy happiness.
You promised you would do that.

It's not going to be as hard to do as you think it'll be.
Tom don't know that Mary doesn't like him.
Are you over 18?
Tom won't leave his children here with us.
Tom didn't realize that we wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought you were probably to do that.
Tom said Mary thought that he might be required to do that next time he travels.
Tom said he did that for Mary.
Tom said he didn't think it's necessary to do that.
Tom said Mary is not sure whether John wants to do that or not.
I thought things would get better.
I hope Tom and Mary aren't faster to do that than me.
Tom said he's glad you're back.
Tom said he thought Mary was unlike to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was concealed.
The way you're planning to do that is dangerous.
You should have come sooner.
I think Tom's strong.
Tom and Mary didn't know they should be here yesterday.
I seriously doubt Tom will be there.
Tom said he's really glad that he moved to Australia.

It'll be hard for Tom to do that.
They said they would only talk to you.
French is her mother's tongue.
I don't think Tom should do that alone.
Tom picked up his bag and left.
I'm not the only one here who's not married.
Tom said that he knew he might not need to do that again.
They know that they should do that today.
You should have been an lawyer.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't know I'm here.
I don't think I need to wear a tie to the party.
I don't think there's any reason Tom has to do that.
Tom said Mary was probably still pessimistic.
I don't think I could do that even if I tried.
I know Tom didn't even ask Mary to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was talented.
I don't think that doing that is a very good idea.
I'm afraid Tom might not do what he's supposed to do.
Tom said Mary didn't want to go to the concert.
Tom told me he'd drive Mary to the airport.
Tom said he's driving to Boston on Monday.
They told me they're sleepy.
I know you and Tom will do that together.
I think this is the first time Tom did that.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be punished.
I know Tom's a very rich man.
Tom must have been home at that time.
I don't think I'm going to be here.
There's no hope.
Tom could have gone camping with you if you would let him know you were going.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary kept doing that even though he wouldn't ask her to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was still interested in doing that.
Are you good at reading maps?
Tom says Mary is a lot.
I doubt Tom will ever do that.
I think Tom's probably a pretty good lawyer.
I thought I could do that without any help.
You're pulling my leg.
I thought you said you would never try to do that by yourself.

It looks like it's going to rain.
Tom said I might not want to do that by myself.
Security is not guaranteed.
Tom didn't offer help.
I think Tom will be truthful.
I assumed Tom had told you that I would be here.
Did you know I'd get arrested?
She's a despicable human being.
Tom already intends to do that.
Take off your school uniform.
I suspect Tom will have to help Mary do that.
I'm afraid I can't.
I know Tom's almost as high as you.
The first time I met Tom, he was only 13 years old.
Tom says Australia is his favorite country.
I suspect Tom has never done that.
I thought we could help.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a kid?
I would like to stay longer.
Tom's planning to do that today.
You're the same age as I am.
Tom and Mary say this will be the last time they try to do that.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Tom said he wished he gave Mary flowers.
They said they had alibis.
Tom was able to do what he needed to do.
I knew you wouldn't like Australia.
I couldn't think of anything.
I wish you never told me.
Tom won't know I'm here.
I don't think you're as good as a driver as you say you're.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had to do that.
They told me they were one-one.
What's the time now?
Tom said things went well.
Tom told everyone he didn't know how to speak French.
I am surprised that you didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary learned how to do that.
I doubt we'll be able to prove that.
I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
Tom was surprised that no one else was there.

This is the first time I've ever eaten in an Italian pizzeria.

I thought you said nobody would be here.
Tom thinks Mary's stubborn.
I'm skinny.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Tom drank less than Mary did.
Tom said he assumed Mary would want to do that.
One cannot do a lot of things at the same time.
I can't remember her name.
The father works.
Tom and Mary say they're not afraid.
I'll save you a piece of pie.
I thought I'd be asked to give a speech.
It's a privilege to meet you.
Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she had to do that.
Tom said he thought you could help us today.
I'm used to stay late.
I thought Tom looked happy.
Tom said Mary should do that somewhere else.
Nobody seemed to want to do that.
Tom said that he knew that he may not be required to do that by himself.
No one told you about the meeting, did they?
I'm aware this is Monday.
Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for him.
I think Tom was supposed to be here now.
I know that Tom and Mary are divorced.
Tom must have seen us.
I know Tom don't know he shouldn't be doing that here.
I know Tom's gonna do that in Australia last month.
Tom has no reason to do that.
Mary told me that she thought Tom was handsome.
I didn't know you would be jealous.
I think both Tom and Mary want something to eat.
They said they didn't mind doing that.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that here.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I knew Tom should do that outside.
I wonder if I should.
I suspect that Tom and Mary knows something's going on.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Tom told me he thought Mary was retired.
What's your last name?
Tom told me he thought Mary had left.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would have to do that.
I know Tom knows that Mary seldom does that more.
You're braver than me.
Tom said he was getting drowsy.
They said they tried to do that once.
Tom said that he thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks.
I should have told Tom not to believe what Mary says.
It would have been interesting to do that.
If you had told me earlier, I would have dressed up.
I think Tom's scared.
Tom said he's sure Mary can swim.
What's her problem?
I think Tom's focused.
I am not interested in this.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
Why is everyone staring at me?
Tom has everything he needs.
They view foreigners with suspicion; I see everybody with suspicion.
I don't think I can do that better than you.
You could have let me know you'd be late.
Tom's dear.
Willing to correct is a sign of wisdom.
Tom would never do that.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
It's not as humid today as it was yesterday.
If I had known how to do it, I would have done it myself.
Tom repaired his bicycle.
You're not really planning on taking pictures, are you?
He's two years younger than I.
Tom and Mary told me that they were frustrated.
I didn't know Tom had to do that more.
I thought you said you've seen people do that.
It's obvious Tom's waiting for someone.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
Tom said he's reluctant to do that for us.
Give it back!
Tom said he thought Mary might help us today.
I thought the concert went pretty well.
I can't cook at all.
I thought Tom knew what we needed to do.
I'm afraid your plan will not work.
I don't think anyone saw us that.
Tom said he thought Mary could win.
I wonder if Tom has another one.
Everyone except Tom seemed to have fun.
Tom said he needed money so he could buy something to eat.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary did that.
I knew Tom finished doing that.
I'm not sure that's possible.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Australia with me.
I thought Tom was still in school.
I knew Tom's next to do that.
They'll be glad they didn't do that.
They say they'll buy that for you.
They say they don't need money.
Tom is unwilling to go by himself.
I know Tom didn't need to do that with us.
Everyone agrees it was the right decision.
Tom got out of the bath and put his clothes on.
I don't think Tom's planning on helping us.
They say they feel better now.
I assume you'll be going to dance with Tom.
Tom thought I might be required to do that by myself.
I don't think that's anyone I know.
I don't think Tom did what you said he did.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
I don't think it'll be difficult for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary wants to go.
Tom and Mary lived both in Australia when they were children.
Tom really thought we didn't need to do that.
It's not good for anyone.
Tom said he's often thinking about leaving.
Do Tom and Mary know that you don't like them?
I know I've been very stupid.
Tom and Mary are both full-time students.
I know that Tom and Tom only need to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary has to do that today.
I suspect Tom and Mary don't like me very much.
I wonder if I can do that.
Tom really thought we wanted to do that.
I wish I could visit Australia.
She's eating.
He's the love of my life.
I think Tom's a good painter.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is making for dinner.
It was not that hard to find a couple of shots that fit.
I would never have let Tom do that.
I promised Tom that I would go to Australia with him.
Tom sings better than me.
Tom said he had a difficult day.
Do you feel like going swimming?
Tom and Mary still hope that they can win.
Tom knows we can't win.
I don't think I could.
You're to blame.
I thought you said your car was stolen.
I didn't know that Tom would be faster doing that than Mary.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were children.
If Tom doesn't do that, I won't either.
Tom told me he thought Mary was funny.
I know Tom didn't know that Mary should do that.
I wonder if Tom really stayed in Boston last summer.
In his heart Tom knew he would never return.
We're not ready to go home yet.
Tom should have eaten more.
I thought Tom was going to give Mary flowers.
Tom said Mary thought John might be required to do that in the near future.
I didn't think we had enough food to feed everyone.
I should have listened to what my mom said.
Tom's wasting time.
I think Tom was exaggerating.
I was convinced that I shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary is probably still nervous.
If this is madness, there is method in it.
Tom told me everything I needed to know.
They told everyone they were upset.
Tom said he won't do that unless I help him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sincere.
She knows about stuff like that.
I don't think I've ever heard Tom complain about Mary's cooking.
I suspect Tom and Mary are ready to do that.
What's the name of your pharmacy?
I don't think anyone else wants to come.
I knew Tom was very busy.
Tom said he thought I shouldn't do that until October.
What are you worried about, Tom?
Tom's a traveling salesman.
I suspect Tom isn't in Boston anymore.
Tom's convinced that he needs to do that.
This is the first time I've visited Australia.
I knew Tom didn't know he didn't really have to do that.
Everyone knows that we killed Tom.
Tom said he would rather not go to Australia with us.
Dinner isn't ready yet.
I hope I'll be able to help you tomorrow.
Surely we could do that, but it would be really difficult to do.
I could have saved Tom's life.
There's a good chance that Tom will ask Mary to the dancing.
Tom told me he found an interesting book about Australia at the local library.
I don't think we can't care for ourselves.
Do you need a lift?
I thought I made my reasons clear.
Tom's someone I'm looking up.
Tom says he's sorry he broke his promise.
I think I have just about enough money to buy the computer I want.
I realize that Tom will try to do that.
I'm very glad to see you.
They said they're cold.
I know Tom knows I don't have to do that.
Tom just did what he should have done last week.
Tom says he doesn't usually wear underwear.
I know Tom is a better musician than Mary.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary planned to do.
Tom and Mary said they would win and they did.
No one knew that but Tom.
Tom thought Mary wasn't cold.
Tom told me he thought Mary was still living in Australia.
I thought Tom would be happy about that.
I know Tom would allow you to do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't asleep.
Tom goes to Boston every chance he gets.
I know Tom never considered to do that.
Did you not know that I was hoping Tom would do that?
They said they'll call you later.
I promise we'll listen to everything you say.
I think you'll enjoy it there.
It's not all that ridiculous.
I wonder if we have to do that.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to do that today.
The fuse has blown.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
Tom should have been interested.
I wonder if Tom really wants me to do that today.
It's not good to ridicule people in public.
We should have planned for this.
I don't think you need to tell Tom why you didn't.
They say they never did that.
Tom and Mary said they're not going to do that.
I know Tom's connected.
Tom said he needed to spend a few weeks in Australia.
Let's get married.
Get the fuck out!
I think Tom's been at Boston at least one time.
He leaves for Tokyo tomorrow.
I wasn't as helpful as I should have been.
Tom said Mary was living in Australia.
They told me they don't like to study in the morning.
You tricked me!
We're too busy for that, Tom.
Is this seat empty?
Tom said he wished he didn't told Mary that he forgot to do that.
You're free to go.
I know Tom is confident.
Tom thinks it's pretty good.
Tom said he and Mary had a fight this morning.
Tom may be lying.
I heard Tom living in Australia.
Nobody told me I wasn't supposed to park there.
Tom could have taken the money.
Tom doubted that Mary would keep her promise.
Make sure nobody enters.
I doubt that will ever change.
Tom told everyone he was bored.
It was clear that Tom was going to do that with Mary.
I suspect Tom is drunk.
I met someone yesterday who knows we.
Tom told me he didn't have insurance.
I hope I can live here with you.
Those agenda items were taken up and blossom for discussion.
Tom said he felt good about that.
I suspect that Tom and Mary knows something interesting about happening.
You know I need to do that, don't you?
They must have found out who I was.
I don't think I passed the test.
I knew Tom was a bad loser.
I don't think Tom's dead.
They said they didn't feel anything.
I knew Tom would like Mary.
I don't think Tom would be afraid to do that if you did it with him.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't be able to win.
My impression of America is very good.
I don't like anyone wearing when I work.
They remained friends.
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be back soon.
Tom said he wished he had not allowed Mary to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary had fun.
Tom said he thought Mary didn't like John.
I don't think Tom can't do that without some help.
Doing that is not difficult.
I'm sorry, I kissed Tom.
I'm horrified.
Tom told me he was very hungry when he got home.
Tom said Mary would probably not know how to do that.
I don't think Tom knows he's not supposed to do that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning to do that.
Tom said he heard three shots fired.

It's hard to do that, isn't it?
The present I got from Tom was the best.
I don't think I have enough money.
Tom wasn't given the chance you and I were given.
How did you know Tom was planning to do that?
Will you give me one pen?
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
I have a feeling that I've been here before.
Tom was rude to everyone.

I don't think Tom would enjoy this movie.
I'm sure your intentions are honorable.
I know Tom is about the same weight as I am.

You should have taken his advice.
They say they like to do that.
I know someone needs to do that.
Tom told me Mary wasn't afraid to do that.
I hope Tom's not tired.
They said they were conservative.
I don't think I'll be afraid.

We could have done it by ourselves.
I thought you might have an idea.
Tom and Mary said that they were heartened.

I don't think I can't help you do that.
I know Tom's the kind of guy who would.
I suspect Tom will help Mary do that.
Tom said he didn't know how Mary would.
I won't tell anyone you're in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to do that alone.
Tom said Mary didn't look too worried.
Tom can swim much faster than Mary.

How did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
I thought Tom wasn't surprised.
I thought you said we wouldn't sing.
They said they'll do that soon.
I know that the last thing you want to do is hurt me.

It is not until you get sick that you realize the value of good health.
I thought I'd broken my leg, but a X-ray showed that I hadn't.
Tom said he wasn't aware that Mary had done that.
There's not much we can do to help.

They told me they would probably do that.
Tom and Mary told me that they were free.
Tom said Mary would probably go to Australia with him.

Tom thinks you're gonna be here tomorrow.
Everyone knows Tom is lying.
Tom must have seen it.
Tom may be a traitor.
I knew Tom wouldn't probably agree to that.
They must have arrived home by this time.
Tom told me he's gonna talk to Mary about that.
I thought you weren't going to tell anyone.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's shoe size is.
She'll do that if nobody stops her.
Put your guns down!
She's my first love.
In summer, eggs soon go bad.

All we can do is hope Tom does what he's promised to do.
I didn't read it.
I don't think Tom really want to do that more.
I thought you didn't want to talk about this.
They've got a green carpet in the living room.
Tom said everyone he knows like doing that.
You are the next in line for promotion.

We're trying to close the box.

We should have done what you advised.
I thought you said you hated to do that.
Tom told me he wasn't an expert.
I know Tom wouldn't ask Mary to do that.
Christmas is just around the corner.
Tom isn't very likely to want to do that.
Tom's the smartest person I've ever met.
A man called you last night.
I'm a little drink.
They're not as hard as they look.
I think this is a step in the right direction.
I'll make sure Tom does that sometime today.
Tom fell in love with Mary the first time he saw her.
I didn't understand anything you said.
You should have left while you had the chance.
I thought you said you had a dog.
No one's out of the woods yet.
Tom said we could go to Boston with him if we wanted.
That won't change anything.
Tom's meant to be.
We didn't know Tom was going to do that.
I didn't know you were planning to do that.
Hi, everyone!
I don't think anyone would agree to that.

Tom would have done that if you asked him to.
I know Tom's a lot smarter than Mary is.
How much did you spend a day when you were in Australia?
I hope I can do that.
I meant it when I said I wanted to marry you.
I don't think anyone was satisfied.
It looks like someone has ripped a page out of this book.
I knew Tom didn't know you were the one who had done that.
I don't think Tom has time to talk to you now.
I think you shouldn't have done that by yourself.
He's a man who gets things done.
I hope you'll be my friends.
Tom said he wanted to try riding an uncycling.
I thought you might know why Tom left early.
Tom assumed everyone knew that he would spend time in prison.
Tell me who your friends are, and I'll tell you who you are.
They said they were very worried.
They told me they were hungry.
It'll be done by the time you get here.
Tom may not have died in the accident.
Tom said he thought he would be able to find another job.
I thought that just happened in fairytales.
I don't think Tom was busy today.
Tom said he accepted Mary wouldn't cry.
I'll be there on the twentieth.
I don't think it's probably Tom will help us.
Tom must have cried.

Tom may be desperate.
The road is parallel to the river.

I'm afraid I can't help you.
I know I'm not alone.
They're not as innocent as they appear.

I promise you I won't be late.

I wonder if the weather will hold.
It would have been romantic to do that.
I know Tom is a much better drummer than I am.
For here, please.

I know Tom can swim better than I can.
Tom and Mary told me they had to go.

Good job, everyone.
They must know I'm innocent.

No one has been injured yet.
I don't think it's up to us to decide.
You're handsome.
This is the first time I've rided a horse.
They said they like to do that.
Stand back, please.
Tom tried hard to calm everyone down.
We all wondered why she had dumped such a nice man.
Those who know me I can't do that.
The first time I held my girlfriend's hand was on the school bus.

What color is it?
I can say, please, and thank you, but that's where my knowledge of German ends.
Tom thinks some of his friends may do that.
When she came to the place where the footpath led over the por, she found small pools of water, and a large amount of mud, so she threw the loaf into the mud, and tread on it, that she could pass without weting her feet.
Tom thought Mary did that in purpose.
Tom must have been showing off.
Tom was paid more than he expected to be paid.
This blackboard is not black, but green.
