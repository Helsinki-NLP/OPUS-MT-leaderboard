The Prague stock exchange crashes against business conclusion into the Minus.
After the steep waste the morning, the Prague stock exchange could correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of Tuesday operations, the Prague stock exchange joined the breakdown from Monday when it fell to another six percent points.
This time the reason for the breaking at the Wall Street was the case.
In the Czech Republic, the response of the market to the result of the vote of the American representative house, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case experienced the shares in the stock exchanges in Asia on Tuesday, although the indices could compensate part of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Börse index in Hong Kong lost nearly four percentage points during the business day, but it could later make part of the losses, so the decline was reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, observed the movement of Chinese shares at the stock exchange in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8 percent, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares in the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan decreased by 3.6 percent after the index there.
"The Timing for the rescue action in the United States is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines its monetary policy itself, regardless of the Chinese Central Bank.
The Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
The American legislatures should return to the negotiation table as soon as possible, according to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rud, to the draft financial system support.
Otherwise, it is threatening that other countries would also be affected by the breakdown.
A blood pool of American shares
On Monday, the American representative house has rejected the plan for support of the financial system for which up to 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion Kč).
The legislators thus ignored the call from President George Bush to support the plan.
The plan believes that the basic causes for the financial crisis would be regulated and thus helping to stabilise the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the main share indices recorded the largest breakdown in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar break-up had last recorded in 1987.
The index has already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly signs that the draft would not come through in the Parliament's house, the index experienced a free case.
Congress makes concession: US government may pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American convention and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
It will be agreed on the beginning of the next week.
In discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid for the American financial system, American laws reached a breakthrough of 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
Congress delegates have to deal with some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be negotiated on Monday in the American Congress.
On Sunday, this was the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank of Reuters.
The Senat could probably vote on the plan at the beginning of Wednesday.
According to economies, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first important psychological factor for the borrowing of financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a "nutrition" because of the complicated mechanisms, how to help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have achieved significant progress.
We have cleared our different views on how a package to stabilise the market will look," said the Democratin Nancy Pelosi against the Agency Bloomberg.
According to their words, there could still be an final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislator met the American Minister Henry Paulson in the evening to give the government fund his final form.
This provides for a purchase of unpayable mortgage activa from the financial companies that risk financial firms in severe losses and risk the stability of the whole system.
"We are at the edge of an final agreement on a plan that will work and which will also need to be effective on the market.
You need to continue the health plan, but I think we're the goal," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also significant in share markets, which are significantly lowering.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, lawrs were strived to reach a final agreement in the convention before Sunday.
In this way, the investors would like to rely on the Asian financial markets that are in the first period of time, where a convention decision might affect business on Monday.
So far, however, is not quite clear when both Chambers of the American Assembly will vote on the law, even if the negotiations are not yet able to fail on a problem in the last minute.
The Legislatives hope that it will be adopted in the next days.
However, the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount used for the system should be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars should be prepared as soon as possible, as President George Bush called.
However, the convention can block the discharge of the remaining money if it feels that the program does not meet its function at more than 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush has a positive progress in negotiations
The President has a veto law in this decision, but the Convention can agree with its veto.
In spite of these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme has remained, which is based on the creation of finances for the purchase of poor mortgage papers whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We worked out everything.
The representative house should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress was satisfied with the US President Bush too.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimated the two sides of effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden fall screens
The President of the Senat's Bank Committee Christopher Dodd, the governing trader, said that the legal authorities had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of beneficiaries and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden case screens for companies’ directors who are involved in the programme and set up a committee to monitor the Fund.
This is intended to lead to the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved a great progress towards an agreement that is important for the market and for all the Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also calculates with a help for home owners who have problems with the repayment of their hypothecs.
The government should negotiate new councils with mortgage sales, with the aim of reducing monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to maintain their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is a good idea according to the main economy of Patria Finance David Marek, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And therefore, because you don't know through which mechanism and what price the problematic activa are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses together," said Marek this week to the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is adopted in the next week or at the beginning of the week, Marek's view is not explicit.
"It is more important that the congressists are trying to support the plan and that they disagree as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on the adoption is at this moment the most important," said Marek.
Duell on measuring cut: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We consult you with your choice
While almost any mobile MP3 files can play, no MP3 player can phone.
That is why it looks like it's better to buy just a phone.
In spite of all, there are sufficient reasons for why to create an independent player.
The choice depends on the kind of use and claims to the future owners.
It is hard for home to buy a greatly expensive plate player to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
One time, such musical news does not appear on LPs, and for quality, there is no objective reason for this.
However, have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the Regal, you probably dream at least of such a thing.
So it is with music on travel, so with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For the one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a Pink Floyd fan will probably rape hard headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough room for every one.
The selection is widely striked.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they won't even create an outlooking way.
No modern device is used as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the symsen, it can play music and videos, both record it, it has a better, a worse photo device and may also navigate.
And if you still include smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in the pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and not photograph a television.
But the universality of the mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the more frequently you will need to download it.
And playing music is one of the largest energy freezers.
Only a few mobiles can play more than ten-two hours, mostly it's much less.
In this respect, Music Player (speakably the simplest) is more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect the cheap phones to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you are calling on your phone, you would prefer to buy a charger for the office - that is also true for more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good holds at least 9 hours unbroken operation with one time uploading.
Another problem then exists if you want to play the music on the phone.
Unfortunately only have a smaller part of the devices via a USB connection, and not any phone without special software can be connected directly to a PC.
Of course, you can cross music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be ready without reducing the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
When players, you do not need a special software until any exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobiles and players themselves set up a music library, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the Genre or, for example, the user's rating.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating systems).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should, especially after the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and, of course, examine the operating comfort.
If you have music especially kulles and just hear them in the street car every day, then you will have any mobile phone that plays MP3 files.
What almost every phone can do.
You do not need to specifically control which music formats can handle a mobile phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and most music you get will be in this format right now.
The format belongs to most widespread, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common AAC is (a format, use Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to call up the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile Internet, and you can acquire a song or album.
This service can already be a surprising argument for why you should make a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of the provider is bad and, mostly, limited only to fast radio heats.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of sale of music (because it is via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will be governed by the music industry in the future.
The phone wears most of them.
If you want to listen to something, take the phone in the jacket, while the player forgot to be home.
However, it comes to whether you can always carry headphones or at least a wireless volunteer system.
If not, you can take back to the integrated speaker, which almost every phone has, but only the least MP3 players.
The most important advantage of the music mobile will be for many in the price.
The cheapest cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very appropriate Walkman.
The largest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are there.
The best and technically tested phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to 15 thousand krones.
The advantage of the player is in light operation again.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve everyone.
A minimum of functions that are similar in operating with the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the plate player is obvious.
It does not threaten a collision in the form of an incorrectly employed mobile internet and a horrendous account for data transfers.
After which device you should take now
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) have usually a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, you will reach two thousand crowns.
But respect.
The basic models usually support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB storage cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to put more than 1100 krones on the table.
Listen to the more demanding hearers, please take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the control comfort comes to the one of one MP3 players.
The most widely here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the series Walkman have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life duration (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide MP3 players from the manufacturer mentioned above.
The first virtual supplier is already coming to Czechia this year.
Maybe
The mobile radio market in the Czech Republic is quite extended, which Czech suppliers offer practically all services as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual supplier that forces the classic to lower prices.
Maybe this won't wait for a long time.
We have often reported on mobile.cz that Czech phone providers are working at the most expensive in Europe.
This also confirmed the Telecommunications Authority ČTÚ, which made it clear that the price for an SMS is higher than the rest of the European Union.
After the last stages of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, there is a paradox situation - for some customers of Czech phone providers, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, it is missing the competition that really makes a fighting claim.
Perhaps it sounds paradox, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
The mobile providers, on the other hand, are pleased to feel that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) is often obliged by Pavel Dvořák, who had often said that there is no place for another supplier in the past in Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic supplier with a own network no longer has exceptionally many opportunities (for example, he would hardly find frequencies).
But there is still an opportunity - a virtual supplier.
The introduction of virtual suppliers on the mobile radio market brought a clear price reduction, which the classic mobile providers had to respond.
There were similar votes before entering such companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain as in Czechia.
However, it has shown that there is space for such providers and that they can really be successful.
In addition, you need not long to search for examples.
In February we reported about the start of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the five largest suppliers of the country.
The Penta financial group, which has U:phon in the Czech Republic, is behind mobility.
The advantage of virtual suppliers is that you can concentrate on a much concrete target group.
In order to work effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic supplier.
They do not need relatively high costs for construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual suppliers usually use low cost fans - they offer cheap telephone talks and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a very good tract to put on a non-clean target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Every guys choose Mobilking - the supplier who likes them and who can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual supplier.
Hard to say, if a similar concept as in Poland could take foot in Czechia.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment based on most virtual suppliers.
It is also relatively satisfactory from the view of the provision of services."
In Czechia chanceless, the mobile providers believe
However, it is almost sure that if a virtual mobile provider conquers Czechia, this will not be mobile.
"While we talk about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem unusually hopefully.
It will be rather a market entry from Mobilking in other countries of our region," says a phone call for mobile.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the Penta financial group.
She indirectly confirmed that the current mobile radio providers in Czechia are not unusually affecting this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything that no potential competitor creates.
Their interest in launching a virtual mobile provider has long-term shows the GTS Novera group that wants to take a further step in order to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in providing our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And ever before, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them we have already been able to achieve negotiations progress", says the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe you'll get better times now.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected until the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an unforeseen wall of silence.
"In this moment, we do not assume that in Czechia there is room for a full-value virtual supplier.
The Czech market shows great specifications to other markets.
So far we have not yet addressed a subject with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his declaration for Mobile.cz Vlastimil Sršeć from the press department of Telefónica O2.
On the specification of the Czech market, further providers will show.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare accordance with the O2 statement: "By long we have not found a livingable and both advantageous project on which you could further build."
And she adds: "The network of T-Mobile will hardly rise a virtual supplier until the end of the year.
At this moment we must have already had a specific offer to be able to think so short-term."
Vodafone focuses on the fulfillment of the requirements of its 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual suppliers, we are open, especially in the field of sharing of costs and infrastructure.
This is what we consider from the view of customers as the best.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The action of mobile providers is easy to understand that another supplier means more competition, this would lead to lowering prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor facilitate market entry?
That the providers can pull on a strike when it comes to something, also the long down and down to the development of U:phone.
The most strong pressure towards ČTÚ was at the time when U:phone came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This also reveals the publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual supplier.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition field of the mobile radio market has recently been reinforced by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile provider.
In taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player on the market itself and above all would provide high requirements for his services."
However, given this approach, the mobile providers admire the absolute determination of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, who is unfortunately in Czech, in contrast to Britain and other highly developed countries, does not have the power to take into economic competition.
This has only the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, has been the most typical attitude of this whole problem.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract between a mobile provider and a virtual supplier has come about the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been completed since the offer of potential interested persons was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic supplier," said in his response to our request Kristián Chalupa from the ÚOHS Department of External Relations.
Such a formulation would not be surprised by representatives of the suppliers.
From an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market is more than doubtful.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "To the abroad where virtual suppliers work very normal, it is to see that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction do not include the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking that the three mobile providers are almost already in line with their reactions.
The question is whether it really is just a chance is on the hand.
Just as the absolute same petrol price at the tank stations is surely only random and the result of a hard competition fight.
"In this matter, the Authority has not discovered any signs of acting against competition, so it has no reason to take any way into the matter.
No one of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his trade on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile radio market for virtual providers are likely to be lacking the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa found in his declaration.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many striking points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ, after telecommunications from the view of economic competition is a single market.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer another insight - for the market entry of a virtual supplier, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone provider has the monopoly for its network.
This means that it is necessary to take a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you don't deal with this argumentation, it should be at least one warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile providers are similar.
In this respect, complaints of a number of interested parties (including the GTS Novera society) indicate that they are infringing very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The disadvantage of responsibility on ČTÚ is then a quite common trick in telecommunications services, which distancing the ÚOHS from the whole matter.
This was already observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted Novelle of the Telecommunications Act, it has failed to implement the extension of the competences of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS have to know this all too well, but they probably have different interests.
It's happening when nobody looks at.
Unspected only the functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are more than one in the Czech mobile networks.
There are companies who spend their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partly public.
Normally, it is companies acting in the multilevel marketing area.
Your own mobile phone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available for selecting.
The widow of the matter is that the company will act as a classic business science compared to the operator, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile providers forbid a similar retail sale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will then discuss what can lead to an end to cooperation with the corresponding society," Martina Kemrová replied on our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that this is not the case with the mobile providers responsible.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such an action.
In fact, the fact that these companies do not allow their profits to be disadvantaged, at the same time, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
On possible problems, Miroslav Čepický makes attention: "The law enables such types of speculations, despite everything the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not running on their name, so they cannot have full value on them as the normal customers of the mobile providers."
But the ČTÚ has to be at least strange.
In addition, another question opens for the ÚOHS.
Does mobile radio providers close the eyes before such an action, why are they locking against a virtual supplier?
It is added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want, it must not be satisfied with the declaration of suppliers that they did not know about it and their business conditions would prohibit this.
When Czechia is no longer expensive
As the text has been stressed several times, virtual suppliers have brought a significant price reduction in the different services.
In all countries where virtual suppliers have been created, the classic suppliers have tried to prevent their development almost more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too small, or too saturated market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
However, in the highly developed countries, in these moments the regulatory bodies, which did not seek the interests of the mobile providers, but who tried to true their customers.
If it were formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator created, and this followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory organs are thrown the whole case like a hot potato.
As a result of our experience, we cannot deny the impression that inclination in the competences in these cases is more favourable.
But we don't throw the bottle into the corn.
When the background information is voted and a virtual supplier soon opened, the Czech mobile radio market may soon be relocated.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to refusing further interests (discriminating).
And the Czechs will finally no longer call on more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the Nationalhymne Wo is my home country on the day of Czech state.
The hymne was newly played by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female soloesang, in chorsis and in a instrumental version.
The singing summary took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech broadcast that he had chosen singers for the Solo-Variants with young, representative voices who are martyr and popular.
"After the beginning, I tried to maintain a clear diction with both and then also with the choir, so that you can understand the text well so that you can create a harmonize," says the conductor.
The Czech national hypothesis next year takes her 175th anniversary.
The song KDE domov mřj first received 1834 on the stage of the studio theatre in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Joseph Kajetán Tyl, which was born from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first strophe of the song then became an organic part of the national hymn after the development of the Czechoslovaky in 1918.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymns sound
The Prague transport companies first transported on Wednesday also on a chip
The Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will enter the history of the Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers will enter an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper vehicle.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who have the chipcard Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (invaluable from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously play them on their chip card in the info centers and branches of the transport stations at the U-Bahn stations Muzeum, M\um, Nadraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letsty, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have been available on the web pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used until the afternoon hours of more than four hundred customers.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the U-Bahn stations where they had to wait regularly in long snakes for their paper vehicles.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, this is played on the Opencard in one of the 13 branches of the city library.
"In these places, travelers are also available to a switcher with trained staff, advise the interested in the Internet shop and also play the coupon on the map," said the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be able to play on the Opencard, which is fitted in some U-Bahn Vestibls.
How do these automations look like?
They're red, remember ridiculous, the passengers may have already noticed in the U-Bahn Stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Then there are five of them in the city, but it should be eighty," Adds Opatrý.
The coupon controls a automation instead of the driver
The operation of the automations that will work from tomorrow is easy.
Only the chip card must be imported, and the coupon previously acquired is playing up from itself.
The electronic coupons apply not only tomorrow in the capital but also in the surroundings.
So in the prestadt trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with above all the inhabitants from municipalities of the region Central Bohems to the capital.
"In the trains included in the Prague integrated traffic, the train benchmark readers can examine the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal from the Organisation Ropid. This organization collaborates the travel plans for the Prague transport companies.
The prestadtbuses have card readers on the cassette at the driver.
When climbing, the chip card must be shown not only when the driver shows, but the Opencard is to be placed on a labeled place on the side of the cassette.
Thus the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"When a passenger checks the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than the driver to ask for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger that does not drive with front-urban buses and no longer knows when the coupon's validity ends, can go to the self-servation machines where the coupons are played on the map.
Here you will display the information about the validity of its documents on the display of the device.
The Sudetes demanded a national decision from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had sought to join the Bohemer Forest to the United States.
This goes out of a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the US screen rule.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans were supposed to have turned to the U.S. Presidents.
This includes a letter that has remained in a private archive and which is stored today in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter of Crumau, the Germans of Krumau asked the U.S. President that he should not allow the return of the "Sudtengaus" - which was taken on the basis of Hitler’s Munich Agreement - to the Czechoslovaky.
"We have understood the situation properly and really want to be sure that the American units do not enter into German territories as oppressors and enemies, but as a freer," says a letter signed with the words "mans who are the fate of the Sudets".
Since the connection to the Czechoslovakia the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech National Character - suggested that they would expect brutality, adherence, understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the U.S. Presidents to take the protection rule over the Bohem Forest for today and forever.
"We can't believe that without prejudice to the view of a quarter million resident in this area, you can speak to a foreign state that suppresss and is trying to eliminate the minorities and have contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter is read.
The reason why the authors cannot sign, is supposed to be the fear of the "chechic oppressors".
If the U.S. President doubts about the attitude of Böhmerwald Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a national decision in the Böhmerwaldau whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the protection rule of the United States.
However, although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the afterwar history may sound a bit naivously, he believes that some witnesses have a good picture regarding the expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Even if the Bohemian Germans had at least had to have no doubt that they were being negotiated through their destruction from the Republic, only a few of them had a chance at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the suddens.
Others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German at the Marine at the East Sea.
When he arrived at the end of the war in British captivity and was brought to a war prisoner camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemical Germans came to him, he was supposed to bring them Czech.
"They believed when they were home, would come to pass the Czech to them," says Chalupa.
No one of the German war prisoners who had lived before the war in the Czechoslovakia estimated that he would be distributed from the Republic on the basis of Beneš decrees.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotion-loaded campaign is addressed to car drivers
The most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
Also, the emotion-loaded media campaign was characterized by the transport Ministry on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš \ebíček's authority promises to bring riders of dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on TV, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to deduct the drivers from too fast driving and alcohol at the tax.
And they're also reminding that they attracted before driving.
The campaign wants to talk to the conscience especially young drivers, motorcycle drivers, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
And what's shown in the spots?
Above all, stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This also proves the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "do not think" stand in uppercases on a marking shield.
And then the word "pay" stands in a blood lag.
This should mean that you can pay a moment of inconvenience with your own life.
The spots will be "shoes" until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the country of England, where you can see normal images with drastic recording of accident victims.
It is promised that the number of accidents and the number of traffic tours are reduced to Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and pepper for car drivers
"For the drivers, the motto applies sugar bread and peach.
Sugar bread means that if they are driving at red, they save time.
The penalty is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the Na Homolce Martin Kořán's transport psychologist.
And that is why information campaigns are necessary in the press and above all negative advertising, the psychologist says.
Even less effective is his opinion of tables that remind the drivers of a danger.
"If you have a static table that warns before a danger, this will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive them," says Kořán.
Olmert would give almost all occupied areas back in peace exchange
The President of the provisorian Israeli Government of Ehud Olmert has expressed itself for the return of practically all the areas occupied in 1967, i.e. the Jordanians, the Eastern Republic of Israel and the Golan heights if we could close peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange.
He stressed this in a interview printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (suppressed) territories, if not all", said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We will have to keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to enter a similar high percentage rate (Israel areas) to the Palestinians because there will not be peace without this," he added.
He admitted that any return would also include Eastjerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to leave a part of Jerusalem," Olmert observed in contact with two attacks in the city in July with which several people were killed and injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "swithstanding solution for the templebers and holy and historical places" located on the Old City territory.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan heights
Olmert expressed himself for a deduction of Israel from the Golan heights, which he believed is an invisible condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require certain efforts on the side of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to close with Syria only on the basis of a deduction from the Golan heights," confirmed Olmert.
"The Syrians know all too well, what they have to have to miss in order to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to rely on their current relationship with Iran; they will have to dispense their relationship with Hisbollah (Shitian) movement; they will have to rely on the constant support that they will have to give to the terrorism of the (Shimitian) Hamas movement, the terror network Al-Khaida and the Shihad (The Holy War) in Iraq", concreted by the Prime Minister.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards in the bus unlawful?
The law does not know it; the relocation is not allowed in a remote bus
In the context of the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether stewards and travelers may run and run in the bus.
"When we are strictly and formally maintaining the law, the activity of a steward is in conflict with the law on road transport", says Karel Hanzelka's minister for Transport.
The accident, which last week killed a two-twenty-year-old Stewardess, was probably caused by the driver of the truck that crossed the bus.
At this moment, the young woman sat at everything unfortunately next to the driver, at which the least safe place in the car, although she still had two more places available.
A bus can also have an accident in the moment or brims sharply, in which the Steward is carrying out coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped with the vehicle letter according to stairs.
If this is not intended in the bus, the travelers must sit.
The telecommunications buses from Student Agency do not have stairs; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed about actuálně.cz.
"This is what we discussed with the Ministry, and this did not first agree to the movement of travelers.
Later you took this back, and we have reached a consensus that the travelers may go to the toilet when they have their seat place," he informed his position.
The law does not know a steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation for the transporter to provide services.
The road transport law only knows the concept of vehicle beneficiaries, but its rights and obligations do not define it," adds the speaker of the Hanzelka Ministry clearly.
On the other hand, the director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pocorný, believes that the law covers this problem in a vigorous way.
"It comes to whether the bus in the product allowance also has standing places.
That's everything," he emphasizes.
Buses are distributed in city buses, where there are stairs and the maximum speed is limited, gateway buses with gateways and a higher allowed speed and distance bus without standing with the highest possible speed and seats equipped with safety guns.
As in the plane, the professional says
The BESIP driver for transport safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In a liquid drive, not many dangers threaten, the situation is similar to the service on board a plane.
Even here is not sure when turbulences come, and the stewardess can cast their head."
"Base a bus sharply, then, of course, also apply the laws of physics.
Just like in the city bus or in a roadway.
The safety of the Stewards must be cleared by internal regulations," he said and also that this problem is not fully solved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to strike services
Student agency offers Stewards as the only bus company services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider her occupation even after the accident as risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of the Steward is risky, I will scatter it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive travelers when climbing.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin founded the lack of Stewards in his bushes, but his society is only a fraction of lines compared to student agency.
"We don't have a steward meal, but we're already weird from the beginning.
Earlier or later this ends with any deadly accident," he had not expressed a whole year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy
During the accident of a line bus to Neapel, a young stewardess was unhappy from the Pilsen region, which had worked for the society two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably cut off without blending from the standing strip and had locked the bus.
The bus driver tried to wipe out through a sharp manoeuvre but collected with the right front part with the truck.
That the two places were sold for the Stewards, Jančura contradicts.
"These places cannot be reserved at remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to complain LKW-Fahrer.
With a compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the court judgment, but it also expects financial damages from the side of the guilt.
A law change?
Not in view
A more precise arrangement for the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring a legal arrangement to work a thirty-equivalent expert team of the Ministry of Transport for over a year.
"This has not yet been a concrete conclusion.
Busse are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the score system, the maximum speed on the carbahn and the use of mobile phones at driving," says Expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the Stewards to be significantly dangerous for the security of travelers," says Hanzelka, controlling the safety of buses in the police and labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorf’s hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words there is no lack of the letter of the WestLB Board to the employees of the house.
By merging units from the Düsseldorf Geldinstitute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkasse Finance Group" can be created in the writing known on Monday.
The WestLB entered a "competence block" with sustainable yield power in such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive incentive to further bonds in the national banking sector.
This is how a board wants to demonstrate activity in difficult time.
Because the hit WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission but also by the Federal Republic of Germany’s financial service oversight, which has recently made the North-Westphalian Government clear that the time has encouraged to find a future solution.
Of a connection between the Deka Bank that knows parking customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has already been speaking for some time - also on Frankfurt.
Although Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas had known at the end of August, in a merger of the house at Mainzer Landstraße with a national bank, such as Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is depending on half the national banks and the Sparkasses associations, has commissioned the Board to talk to the WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be the capital market or parts of it.
The conversations are openly, meaning at the financial site, just first started.
The Deka Bank, which is part of its 3000 employees to the important employers at the Frankfurt financial course, is not the first time when consolidating the parking sector.
In 2003 it looked as if the deka bank could float with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
But there was nothing from this Trinal covenant.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian national government spoke to participate in the Helaba.
The two other houses also didn't find each other together.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart instead.
However, there have been more and more thoughts about a connection between the Deka Bank and the Landesbanks.
However, Günther Merl, chairman of the Helaba, had recently expressed himself against plan games about a cohesion with his house.
Depending on this, however, the knowledge appears to ripe that a collapse of the different houses of the public legal sector does not.
After now the Country Day election in Bayern is over, the first could approach a connection of BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure is risen to further mergers, it continues and go to the partners for it.
In the south, she would only be Junior partner, although she has encountered the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Sparkasses and Giro Association of Hessen-Holstein, who is involved with the Helaba, preferred a riel.
Stay at least the North LB.
Such geostrategic thoughts are only the one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses match each other.
In June Merl expressed the crucial question of which business models should be ensured to ensure the futureability of the national banks would not have been answered by the German Sparkassess and Giro Association.
At the end there could also be a distortion of the West LB, which is not desired there.
In this way, in the letter of the Board there, it is spoken that there is at least a "all-resolution" for the house.
How this can be brought under a hat with the deca bank with individual units, will still show themselves.
The second weekend is known as "Italian weekly"
For Elena it is the first time for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is his girlfriend with it, and he says everything else.
Behind them, at the five-liter-bier fiber of the brand emperor, a massively built beard and proves the about 200 October-fastered, which can produce deep sounds his throat.
Elena's just giving Luca a cup, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking site next to the Puorta Nuova railway station, starts four buses this evening at 23.45 p.m., "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved mainly to the Italian, in a bus travel exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated in the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italy.
Marco, who wears a long mantel with pelzimitate feed and a brille with broad silver belts, include the buses.
For five years they have driven to October festival, three tours are this year alone.
At night, day on the wheat, back at 22.30 p.m.
Overnight only would mean unnecessary species, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the ride, the welcome combustion with Kaiser-Bier, breached the Bavarian purity bid, the health insurance and the German travel guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their forces.
In Brixen and wood churchs, other buses with Italian marks at the carbahn 8 will take a break before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot at half seven o'clock in the early part of the parking area near There are the 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather themselves, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First, set up the yellow cab.
On the left side of "Oktoverfest", in Fraktur, the Internet address of Marcos Travel Office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors go up to beer, it means running!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Lauf!" run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, otherwise we block, and not all yellow uses to the same banks, distribute in the room!"
The measure, Marco braves, costs 8,25 euros.
Don't forget about drinking money.
"The security people show that we take ourselves well!
Once you leave the places, they're gone!"
Thirdly, "Tonight, point half eleven again here!" Response?
And it's going to the grass.
On the way, a yellow head binds to the trees, painters, and even to the election place of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be crazy for the retreat.
It's the second weekend, known as "Italian weekly".
Exact information on figures is not available; the talk is of 50 000 who are on the way over the Alps and fall into the beers, ten percent of all visitors should be traveled from Italy on this weekend extra.
The Munich Police is strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads to a National Statistics, in which the Italians face Britain (about 60 revenues) and Austrians (about 80) are the first place with about 200 medical care.
It is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for believers of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, stressed Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück only in the last week.
How well that politicians used the word "relatable" and also influencing that the German banking sector is not exposed by the crisisful developments.
Because this has now come into the weekend.
The Münchner Immobilienfinanzier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) is reported in the dax to receive a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect the turbulences on the markets.
Reuters said on Monday to be a trusted person who said that credit aid was up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only make the part that they also use.
The money comes from private and public legal banks.
Backgrounds are losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he granted money, the State financer had extremely short-term refinancing, which is not possible for the markets now because of failure.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank's bar reserve was reduced by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the own capital rate was slightly deducted from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current earnings and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous period, the revenues from payments to claims and certain securities and the resolution of credit operations were reduced by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
Only due to higher earnings from refunds of lower-sale charges from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the refund of interest in the taxation regulation and from the business provision for companies, the amount of revenue had been moderated by about 16 percent.
The former state financer had first speculated himself with commercial real estate credits that were then divided into the Aareal Bank after his privatisation in 1990.
As a result of the negligence of classical government financing, Depa has then been more engaged in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects for private investors and the State (Private-Public Partnership, PPP) and international diversification.
At the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that have a "real material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite uncertain.
In fact, the dividends were deleted.
She was shortened by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major State and infrastructure financer since the Depa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions from the refinancing on the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit provision under the banks is widely versioned, since banks listened to their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term refinancing of a part - around 50 billion euro - of the Depa credit portfolio.
After notification of the Hypo Real Estate, the financing needs of the group with the credit at a decisive time and the company is protected from the influence of the currently largely functional incompatible international monetary markets.
From other sources it is heard that thanks to the funds, the refinancing was secured by the end of 2009.
The HRE chairman Georg Funke stated, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take account of the financial markets at a time.
Bundesbank and the financial service oversight map (BaFin) assume that the mortgage of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
That is hopeful for shareholders and creditors of the Bank.
But in view of dynamics and inconveniences of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not even unavoidable that financing must not be fully used.
But also the opposite is not locked out.
After the bank's conception was still before insolvency on the late Sunday evening, the minimum provisional rescue may not be calm down.
The share rate is 75 per cent to EUR 3.30.
It is right, however, to keep the lending courses well.
If the priority debts are hardly moving, the courses of the follow-up bonds are much more explicit.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are affected and understandably the periods exceeding 2009.
Similarly, hypo-real-estate bonds have been a speculative investigative, so their value after the significant deterioration of the banking crisis and the institute itself, which, with the overtaking of the decay, had only been in the house, must be regarded as depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the note banks, governments and less affected business banks are still ready for supporting the system, as long as the pension may expire in time.
Or it happens, what hardly waits to wait for someone at present - that the financial crisis will be overwhelmed in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reporting on sub-governmentalities, only a legitimate hope has been made from the probability of safety at present.
This may especially provide long-term believers some sleepless nights with the decision to separate their commitments.
Short-term investors may, however, use a loss lecture for the future tax payments on course gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, the first school day at the Tachibana high school, the girls begin to shake: The German is "kawaii"!
What that means?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel in front of the school course.
I live on the edge of Tokios in the direction of Kawasaki and take 40 minutes by train to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, for luck I didn't go.
The beginning of the class does not seem to be as strictly determined at the Tachibana as with us at home in Niedersachsen.
From eight o'clock to nine a short meeting round begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the teaching started, I was on the series to introduce me.
I am not the type who likes to speak to people yet before a class of 40 students.
Because I still had no school union, I attracted an old rock of my guest mother, with bleeding, blue knee straps and black leather shoes.
So in this elevation, I put the pult before and tried to talk to everything rightly: 'Sayonara Where she is Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, come from Germany and have birthday in a week.
At the moment I was very happy that I had started the language for two years before.
The 31 girls in the class have all chickened, choked and wounded, and lastingly I heard the word "Kawai".
I already knew that of my mangas.
It belongs to the survival important japanese girl and means 'necessary, sweet'.
Then I was quickly cut on my place.
The girl next to me was quite broad, she found it an honor that the exchange school should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the Gong sounded, I was totally embarrassed.
Everyone talked through each other, chickened and asked me holes in the belly - it's really difficult to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all of them packed out their bentos.
My guest mother had made me such a luxury box - that's a little different than the dead German breaking bread.
I had rice with herbs, little worms, salads from straps and algae, fruits and a kind of meat in the tofuant.
Most of all, I don't blame await what I eat here in Japan.
Things look remarkable and taste completely curious.
It's firm that everything's really delicious.
Well, maybe until the salty-posited plums may, brirr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes appears that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento that she then is particularly artificially constructing - in the hope of getting to know the boys at the breaksnack.
That's what I read in my Manga comics.
I'm looking forward to seeing this.
'Why out of Japan?' I asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said:
"I'll find it fascinated."
Finally, I have been reading the most popular mangas for years.
And so that I better understand the comics and culture in it, I also started learning somewhat a little Japanese.
So it was totally clear for me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a fabulous for tradition, morals and customs.
And on that you put great value here.
On the other hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't even felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Also rats have feelings
A rat or a shame flying in danger means that she feels too fearful?
The neuro scientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
How can you check if they feel the same if they act similar to us?
The Internet magazine " Edge" has been published several years of contributions to famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presented in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness, without that I or anyone else could prove this until now where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we may hope at least because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we use other species and apply questions about imagination or general consciousness, we are inevitable because the hardware does not agree.
If a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it is dead, flewd or attacked.
People act similar to what some scientists close to comparable subjective experience.
But I do not believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
To the end, the almost always associated with human consciousness cortex include the side-by prefrontal cortex (for its participation in the short-term thought and to the performance / control functions).
This wide region is developed much higher in human beings than in the rest of the primates and seems to be totally missing in other creatures.
At least those aspects of our consciousness depending on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge we are, and the ability to plan and decide, so there is reason for the assumption that the human being is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic own character may be in the human language: as a large part of its experience is linked to language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may also be created, may be very different from most of our consciousness conditions.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may look in other animals.
If it is, as something internal and subjective, neither measured nor, because of the special hardware, can be analysed on the basis of our own experience, his research makes us great problems.
Most of my statements relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that would be more easily accessible to science.
You could examine the awareness processes of animals without prejudice to their content, and that is exactly what happens when studies on the short-term thought of primarys, especially the example of visualisation.
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one is more likely to be similar to the neural correlate of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the condition of visualisation.
What does the feelings mean now?
I remind them that a emotional system such as fear is activated in one of his own activity.
So what we call as "fight" is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain localized defense system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) occupied memory.
Similarly, feelings are closely bound to the regions of Cortex, which characterize primats and, in particular, people.
Joined with the linguistic nature, we have a fine classification of the phenomenon because we can differentiate and categorize with the help of the words and grammars in order to attribute them to us as well as to others.
On the other hand, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings from primitive activities in the cortex and the Hirn tribe come out similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more concentrate on the hierarchy.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it may be part of gambling feelings.
I cannot contradict this pure theoretically, but I think it is unreasonable.
Pankseep argues what is seeming like fear in the case of rats and humans, probably also feels like in both cases: But how can you check if rats and people feel the same if they act similarly?
Is a shame flying in danger whether she feels fear too?
In my eyes, only behavioral equality cannot prove a likelihood of life.
Although the neural comparison continues: rats and humans have similar brain stamps, not even a brain.
But is the hierarchy responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove that for the people, how did you want to prove it with rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sculptures (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings probably differ basically from our (that human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I rather examine emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress is made at the neural level if you miss the same in rats and people.
As I do not examine language and consciousness with rats, even not feelings, I don't know if they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I rather come forward than walking constantly against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionist.
Uefa president Platini: Term of Grace for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Ministers.
"The government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as a trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"This is not an amnesia for our country.
The work has just started and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of the cities, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts left behind.
It may even be reduced by the number of EM acts from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We must now work with maximum speed," said Ukraine Association President Grigorie Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us constantly in the eye."
A more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
At the request of the Minister for Sports, Drzewiecki, had come together.
It is "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer below."
Several initialists were condemned in the past season alone because of manipulation to forced increase, and finally even the liga start had to be moved short-term.
Democrat Dennis Quaid defeats
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked in interview about Privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan outete her flosser Dennis Quaid as a marital winner.
It's shaken - and beat back.
Delayer Rosen War at the Ex-Ehepaar Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after divorce, the two Hollywood shoe players are now wearing an incredible dispute - in all public.
Meg Ryan had spoken in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week for the reasons for marriage’s disappointment: "Dennis was untreu for me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud she had only experienced after divorce.
Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" was told the history of a breakdown.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as untreu husband was clear: "Isn't hesitate," said the 54-year-old of "New York Daily News," that "Meg re-coops and turns the history of our relationship again."
It is also "fortunate" that the 16-year-old son of Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and relapsements that mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became father of Zwillingen.
And so close his inmissions with the side hib: "My life continues at all.
I appreciate lucky that I have a wonderful family that is best going."
Reduce prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper than 50 percent according to current study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become more cheap - that's the result of a study of the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and detected a significant break in the second quarter after an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices have risen on the hotel market for many years, overnight stays have already agreed.
From January to March, the prices in 41 of 48 studied European cities increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already less than 3.6 percent less than in the previous year.
The most clearly was the trend in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year before.
As a cause for this, American Express sees the weak dollar course that led to a "decreasing travel to American tourists".
Also, financial places such as Frankfurt or London were more affected by the decline of the hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices have an increase of 26.3% even the record in Europe.
Also at the flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still showed upwards:
As a result of cerrosin defense, travelers had to pay 7.1 percent more in the economic class in the cut 2007, driving incentive long-strip flights have even been more expensive than 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices for tickets from the Economic Class sank by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, however, in the business and first class, the price changes were far lower.
In Germany the prices broke even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, the prices have even been half at German domestic flights.
The reason for price break is, on the one hand, the deterioration of economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the flight market breaches.
On the other hand, the open-section agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
Signs of the endeavoured situation are the striking of unprofitable routes at airlines, as well as the high number of airlines notified in the first half of 2008 concurrence - only in Europe were this 24 airlines.
HSV strikes Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, Hamburg's SV Table Leader becomes.
With the Borussia, Luhukay does not continue to find a working eleph.
By crystals Small increase fracture for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game only late and shooted with a Heber to the latte.
His message was precisely formed, she was convinced about the lips.
He just knew that he was right.
"We need the second gate," snatched Hermann Rieger in the cabinet of Hamburger Arena.
Viel wasn't in the catacombs, the half-time break was finished and most sat again on their places.
Rieger was nearly three decades of the physiotherapist of the HSV. He enjoys a higher view than a few painted actors.
And so his request also found hearing in the responsible place.
Assistance trainer Cornelius Jol nicked and cited the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's headtrainer Martin Jol.
This command will have sounded similarly: here with gate two!
The implementation continued.
"There wasn't all good today," later admitted Marcell Jansen.
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have "developed".
The 1:0 (1:0) has due the Hamburgers to the Mladen Petric headballtreffer (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," pleased Martin Jol.
The Hamburg SV is 121 years old this Monday.
The viewers celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky over the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their association as a class zip.
It will become a birthday without a real party.
"We know it," said Marcell Jansen.
He notes that the tablerian intermediary product is more for the unpredictability of the Liga than for the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Tor Protection Petric and the Jansen from the FC Bavarian - is slow, but she cannot be able to shine.
"We need more flair and more drives," Jol asked.

In the context of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called faul mortgage papers are intended to be provided.

In contrast, the State should receive share optional certificates from the financial companies which could be dissolved in appropriate course development in order to reduce the burden for the public cassette.

Dark matter influences air flight of room probes
For years, a mystery phenomenon has been providing for research for ratlessness: Dark matter affects the speed of room probes during so-called Swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general relativeity theory could not be quite correct.
Nearly 18 years ago, the space probe "Ulysses" flog through the space.
Because of freezing fuel pipelines, you are now threatening the cold-coltod.
Scientists have been providing a mystery phenomenon for confusion for years - the Swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space seeds, where they receive additional swing in the Gravitation field of a sky body, such as the earth.
This allows the sins to save a lot of fuel.
The European American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun Sun Sun Ulysses.
However, as the researchers have been surprising for years, the airlines do not act 100 percent as expected according to the old Gravitation Act.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The sunshine become faster or slower.
So far, the physicians couldn't explain this effect.
They baptized Sweing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even the general relativeity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of matter by croping the room, could not be quite correct.
The American physician Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton continues to believe that Einstein wasn't wrong, and is trying to explain the Swing-by-anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter that have made astronomers in the universe.
"Responsible for anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
From the existence of the dark matter, the space researchers know only for about ten years.
Apparently, it is a attractive force, whose effect on other sky bodies is observed.
However, it is totally invisible, i.e. it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
After the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter is always well a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists discharged in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists slapped in Egypt should be free, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
So Soedan distributors had demanded several million euros of solvents.
In the event of a shooting before the release, six hosts should have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
Solve money negotiations are already supposed to be running.
Germans always advised to the Visier of Kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE paints the most important cases.
The sahara-slepped European tourists are apparently free.
This reported the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV sender Al-Arabia and Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports from the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We just check her health condition," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a rumine, and their eight Egyptian companions were well up and in security, reported the Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedit should already be on the way to Kairo.
Unclearly, the background of a shooting before the release of the hosts: after information of an Egyptian security officer, the sudanese army had therefore been prepared to end the delegation before the sudanese army killed six of the entrepreneurs.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the official said.
It was "only about taking the hosts in receipt" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Tschad and Egypt on Sunday and took two of them in arrest.
The hosts had requested Germany to pay a salary of six million euros, and the money should be transferred by the German wife of one of the hosts.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in appeal to a German mediator, which delays the release of the hosts because the cylinders feared their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hosts after payment of the solvent money.
The men should be held as long as the kidnappers had a safe flight driver.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Stieffather abused "to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led a woman to kill him, a court was reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a sentence of six years after he had been eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Court of First Instance in Truro found that he regularly found his step-to-folder Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in a consent: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Ms. Randle killed himself at her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, aged 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had bound her eyes and bound her eyes before he conducted sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife read apart in the 1980s and moved back to Cornwall.
His stepper went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of her time honorably for the national trust, was pursued by the abuse which had been added to her two times a week.
State lawyer Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends said that Ms Randle, who had been an active surferin and cyclist, had been "emotional dead" since 2006 and had given up their life"
In April 2007 her right father Terrance Randle found her in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she has killed herself by distorting himself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a letter of consent, who ended: "I kept her fesseling and connecting her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been anxious, especially as she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Still worse, the fact that it is very unlikely that the case was not injured in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanies' father and mother, of her deed over the years on her daughter.
She would have been clearly a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for data lost shall be accused
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be accused of the public security law.
The man was ordered from the Ministry of Defence when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were transferred to the BBC before they were handed out to the police.
It is the weakest claim within the law and there is no reference to criminal intention.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said: "They thought that this would be internally interfering with the defence ministerial and cabinet."
The person whose name cannot be mentioned shall be accused in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause which refers to the safe storage of information.
The royal state prosecution recommended that the officials should be accused by the Metropolitan police because of the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he deposited included classified evaluations on Al-Quaida and the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Apartment construction companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could be in the house after the Bradford and Bingley Bank's rescue costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest rates for this loan shall be paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Apartment Construction Societys (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "inconsistent" that society and its members should pay.
The 14 billion loans will be reimbursed at last when Bradford & Bingley's loans are paid.
However, the interest rates added in the meantime are calculated each year to those 700 financial companies accepting deposits.
The programme for the compensation of financial services confirmed the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions who have been careful ... are now called to take some of the costs of those institutions who were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company should pay in relation to the deposits that it would hold, and that the companies together had to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan interest will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies need to create 81 million pounds for the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Apartment Constructions, told the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions who have carefully acted during the development of real estate are now calling for some of the costs of those institutions who were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of records in 1945.
"We will watch all aspects of this matter over the next weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The rates that will be due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year, and that could be almost double.
Since construction companies are non-sociated organisations, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest rates on saving accounts.
Milk becomes five Pence per litre expensive
People on Jersey are faced with paying more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it will raise the Grand Market Prize of his milk by another five Pence per liter of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after studies of a consulting company have been conducted.
The retailers should decide whether they want to pass the price increase to their customers.
Before the rise in the price in February, the Grand Market Price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied Caution
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a cheek from the former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means she could be arrested when she returned to the country.
Their defendant said that the court Caution refused to have pressed 50 million Taka ($729.700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several sweating claims because of corruption against them.
Shech Hasina's long-standing political Rivale, Khaleda Zia, was released at the beginning of this month against Kaution.
Shech Hasina is supposed to return to Bangladesh in the next weeks, but her party, the Awami Bündnis, demanded that the militaryly supported transitional government should first give her unlimited freedom.
The correspondents say that although their liability was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the framework of their release whether they will continue to remain on free foot if they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers indicate that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Upper Court.
"The upper court rejected Scheich Hasina's barbecue bite, because it says that she must not get a cheese, since she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will register a case of law against the upper court."
Their lawyers agree that they need cheating to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
It is expected that Scheich Hasina would return home after 17 October, a Awami party chair said on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over the power but was released from the prison in June to go to the abroad for medical treatment.
Both Scheich Hasina, as well as Khaleda Zia, all accusations lie against themselves.
Fears for anti-polio initiatives in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200 000 children are not affected because of the violence associated with the Taliban, the United Nations.
The United Nations have carried out a vaccination programme last week in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN speaker, this was the case, despite the promise of Taliban, that thousands of people do not attack or hinder the vaccination.
BskyB loses complaint in case ITV
BskyB has lost his complaint against the competition Commission’s decision to reduce its share in the competing sender ITV.
BskyB has ordered to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs deteriorates competition and would allow him to influence the ITV sender.
BskyB has acquired its share in 2006 by successfully renaming NTL, now in Virgin Media, on the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the competition authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB provided doubts about the independence of the ITV, which has moved the competition Commission to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Office of Communication Ofcom have expressed themselves against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share in ITV would be an inadequate and excessive measure, especially because BskyB had announced that he wished to suspend his voting rights.
New investigation in US State Prosecutor
The U.S. Advocate General has appointed a special mediator to discuss the announcement of the nine lawyers in the United States in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the Administrative Workers were criticized.
The report criticized the officials of the Wissen House, Legislatives and the former Advocate General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fears that lawyers were suspended for political reasons.
The special median Nora Dannehy should now clarify whether the officials heard during the investigation have lied to the mediators to behind the justice.
Several prerequisites, including criminal acts, have not been fully studied or clarified, said the General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The calling of a special mediator with the power to force the Witnesses to say was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began from their offices as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that state lawyers would dismiss because of weak employment.
However, it was later found that the dismissed state lawyers were not worse than many of their colleagues, which caused many observers to consider the announcements as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-level Republican Congress members, while others refused to examine the prerequisites on the democracy of the Democrats.
U.S. state lawyers are commissioned to examine and monitor judicial cases for the government.
They can be released at any time, but may not be deposited for political reasons.
At that time, the Head of the Ministry of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, has been advocated for dismissors and has put his office in the final effect.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also announced.
The General Inspector's report has critically discussed the role of Gonzales by showing the "Haupt Responsibility" for the dismisses, his leadership role "assigned" and "interested" in the process
Other officials, including the former Head of President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for lack of cooperation with the mediators.
Meat Loafs epischer song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, the next week in London, said that he was honored to be recognized by his special golden price during the discharge.
The song lasting nine minutes and fifty seconds was the track at Meat Loafs Hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" means nominations for this year after it came into the closer selection in four categories.
The head editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs that go beyond such mathematics such as time and Genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" are certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with a instrumental part that takes nearly two minutes.
The song was released in 1979 as single in the UK and has reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold over 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 because of irregular hearts after being broken together on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to acute chicken head inflammation.
Later he knew that he had a cyste on his voting band.
Obscure street in city, often forgot and perhaps soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, sideways and other navigation roads, some of which are famous and others just comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-term local residents to say where there is extra place, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small street is located in the East Village and runs from the First Street direction north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks rather like a dusty gas than after an active doorway.
There are no street paintings as well.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard street plan.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that has recently built luxurious buildings on the First Street.
It wants to plant extra place to create a clean doorway to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other representatives, the long-year-old neighborhood, who says it is fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the city management department responsible for the protection and establishment of the residential buildings and for the road does not have any interest in receiving it.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Council of municipality this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the street by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted in the next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the Council of municipality 3.
"Only little space is staying in the possession of the city and we want extra place to continue to hear the city," she said.
"There may be offers how to repair the street and commit what could be done by Avalon, but we also want the public access to remain guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago, newly planting the small streets and set up seats, which are intended for a café to rent the company.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made the first time during the meeting in this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the street, but it didn't necessarily want to have it.
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is to renovate and make a public hit," she said and added that the city had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the Department for Building Protection, said that it was actually the desire of the city to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop the real estate rather than manage.
Compared with his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, extra place has maintained something of his historical impression.
Some believe that the street has received its name in 1802 when a large farm that Philip Minthorne heard was divided between his many children and a close strip land was not charged.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the Punkrockdenkmal, which was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is mostly known as a culisse for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who had made the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scratch, lumps and parts of feathers, posters, leaves and silves.
Some residents, including the blogger who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of sale of Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised extra place as a seldom – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city, which should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who acts the blog called "Jeremiahs disappearing New York", has published a part of the conversation of the City History on Extra Place, which was published in the "The New Yorker" magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow baggasse, which remains even over the dark day and characterized by the roasted metal doors of the camp halls, closed windows and rainy weekly newspapers."
With a few exceptions, the street has just looked like this recently on one night.
A rat walked through the back part of the street, not far from the door, which had previously led to CBGB, where there is a more expensive clothing business today.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and a empty bottle of beer was not far from a fresh coat of evolved newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about extra place, but they suggested that the street could be parked something.
Fields, added that, according to his opinion, some people underestimate the road's journey in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moisture and excited.
Discussion on two-speaking training: Education in English-speaking environment
In this education Watch edition, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for two-lingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, director of scientific staff in California studies and director of the Directorate-General for Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a competitor of the book "Don't be as good as you think, why the middle class needs a school selection".
The hispanic electorate is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example for this.
Obama's election campaign mentioned that "the probability of schools with Afro-American and hispanic students is lower than white students" - what is true.
In order to close this performance distance, Obama's educational plan, among others, recommends a two-speaking transitional phase in the training for those who first learn English.
However, the question of Obama is whether its use for the two-speaking training that focuses on teaching in other languages than English is contrary to its interest to reducing the distance in school services.
For example, let's take "Sixth Street Prep", a basic school in the east of Los Angeles.
The majority of students are hispanisch and come from families with low income.
More than one third of the students who have recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, surprising 100 percent of students of the fourth class have lived the state test in Mathe at a good level.
93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were also surprisingly assessed in the English test.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on continuous control of knowledge and a position that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach after which the training is running in a English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point to observe the Obama, the school leader Linda Mikels.
This approach sets value to the almost exclusive use of the English language in the subject.
Ms. Mikels, who refused the idea of two-speaking training, said to me that the school had a remarkable success with a pupil who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later you would be entering the classroom and couldn't recognise him again.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with great share in Latin American and other English students?
The school performance would make the answer easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national image union associations have long been supporting the idea of two-speaking training) and its own consistent support of the two-speaked training predictions on Obama's answer.
While he agrees with the point that immigration should learn English, he recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should stop making concerns about the legislation intended to be "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can have Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance distance, he should take careful educational models that work instead of despising and trivializing them.
The oil price is reduced by the renewed fears around the economy.
On Monday, the oil price is very disturbed due to the fears that even the American budget for financial markets could not be enough to re-establish the economy.
The Raw oil terminal businesses at the New York Trade Board have fallen by 7 percent on $99.80 per barrel during the morning session.
Last Monday the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the last two weeks the goods markets have been shaken by the financial turbulences at Wall Street and by strong whirls in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices had reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they had fallen to almost $90 per barrel in this month to rise again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have already been concerned, although convention representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan that should be the largest in history.
This message was overestimated by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from being completed.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup is to purchase the banking operations of the Guardovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
After analytics at Barclay's capital, despite the endeavoured negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it was not possible to live the vote on the markets.
As the economic situation is further deteriorated, it is expected that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decrease.
The German Bank analytics wrote in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"With the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US American virus is spread worldwide, especially to China."
The bank analytics have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the next year and reduced their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Inwards Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after he died more frequently over the last eight and a half years than any other in the Jets-Trikot.
Then he saw the second quarter in which the Jets changed a resultless game into a triumphal train.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
After a dirty game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which met the bad weather, the second quarter began.
But when Quarterback Board Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard showdown, this marked the perfect look at a afternoon on which its developmental cooperation made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one once as an exhibitor, and the other for 10 seconds before the end of half time.
"I didn't especially strive," says Coles about the Passes who went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing fishing, the defense Quarterback Kurt Warner took apart.
On the outside, Darrelle Revis started a unhappy worm and changed him into a 32-Yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and started him.
Linebacker David Bowens then cared for a loss of warners.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds in the game when Jets conquered the ball and Jay Feely changed a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 leadership.
These were the most points that the Jets had ever reached in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the wahnzine answered Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
The answers both, because in the third quarter of 21 points were left without a single, Mangini said: "I believe I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in short time."
Fresh Gebrselassie hits his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some hold him for the best long runners of all times after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon Berlin on Sunday and became the first man who created the route of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus established its 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he at least reached a World Championship title on every route from one kilometer to the Marathon.
Last month, Brüselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, because of fear that was possibly exaggerated in afterwards that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Rather, he has notified himself for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per kilometer.
Since train runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have been switching to long tracks, the record time for Marathon has fallen over the past 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa has won from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie reported the press that he had had two weeks ago in his wake and couldn't train a week.
Apparently after break, he was refreshed and did not come back.
"I am so happy," he said to report.
"All went perfectly.
I resume training a week ago and had some concerns today, but at the end everything super."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rivals from East Africa - that he is excessively orchestrated, many world-most marathon stars generally avoid, leaving too much on the race leaders as if this would be a railway race and brings world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of breaches as long runners.
Brasselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04 with four Kenyans on Sunday.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai, and Charles Kamathi still demanded Gebrselassie after the tempomachers had left.
Some more than three miles before the finish, Brüselassie has made its last entry to separate from Kwambai, who arrived as a second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.

Irina Mikiteenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Deutsche, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh result of all times with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Britain.
In the last spring, the 36 years old Mikiteenko had won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She has missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injuries. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has planned her course by leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners only out but over 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31, while Helena arrived Kiprop from Kenya as a third in 2:25:01.
The pride and straps in the life of the black population, in a city of the very special kind
It is hidden between the eruptions of leisure parks in the surroundings of Orlando, a few miles away from the glitzing, loud and gigantic breibs, a quiet city in which the pride and complications of the Afro-American culture come forward.
Eatonville, the first black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe how Hurston did it in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three kites, 300 brown ports, 300 good swimers, more than enough guaves, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pilgrim.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that it describes – and which it made a tourist destination by taking it into Florida travel leaders who were produced at the time of depression by the German writer project – in many respects a place of the very special varieties.
Eatonville is as independent and private as in the 1930 ’ s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who knows so little about us that he doesn't know what is going away.
Even today, in a year in which a black presidency candidate, senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about race relations, many are still sorry here to be observed by foreigners.
"We are very careful about how our history is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to an resident of the city and municipal member of the oldest church of the city.
It must vote."
Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of triumph and fight.
It is both a historical example of black movement and a community of almost 2.400 inhabitants where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
On the one hand, it is a highburg of literature and, on the other hand, an example of - sometimes condemned - black culture of rural south, which has its roots in the American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents are both proud and on the hat.
And so correctly, the concerns about Eatonville's image started with Zora, as all Hurston call here.
She presented the world her hometown in books that were written by heart and written in mouth like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in Florida travel leaders changed the city, which is very close to the route 77, a street that leads through the often-gotten centre of Florida to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frech like Oskar both in the real life and in literature, Hurston readers led to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"After the street to the left," she wrote, "has the brown - pointed modern school, with her maintained gardens and playgrounds, which always cares for Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Cook all kinds and what-smoking-rooms fit to hour rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston took care of Eatonville with self-regulation, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel leader.
In fact, this was not a portrait estimated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Denkins, one of the Johnson girls provoked the chassis by quoting the men, singing songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual play.
She added, "Many people didn't like this."
You still remember Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family was moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
August Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston was brewed into the city, she usually did this without warning, clothing in a warm chickening chicken, smoking and with hosses, in a city, which itself is one of its venerable clothing styles today.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many were despised.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "She never stayed too long," he added while he shaken in his chair, on a back terrace that looks at the Sabelia Sea, where Hurston was baptized for all probability.
When she died in 1960, she was poor, and her books fell.
With the majority of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a timegeneral Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was contributed in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there were no great memorial celebration, no public readings in the great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the lowest," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wraped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-spure highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-spure main road of the municipality.
Orlandos Vororte had already pushed the car 4 through the western border.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Zwangsintegration, including, had ended the relative idyllic insulation of the municipality.
In the 50s, the fight against race mixture brought hatred into the Community.
"In this time, often a hip of white boys came and she warf Orangen and witnessed to the remote people," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelone from the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston asked the Supreme Court to force integration by declaring its decision against the School Council as "politics rather than my race respective".
Today, residents say that although the withdrawal of race separation in some respects was positive, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his young people.
"Children children were pleased to be embarrassed - I remember - they embraced his teacher in the morning, and they embraced his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and conductive director of the common group for the protection of the Eatonville Community.
This could be received as long as she added until teachers and students were no longer from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural air," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have contributed to the creation of room for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who rejected prejudices, as they did, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made himself on the way to Hurston's nameless grave and began fighting for the re-employment of her reputation.
Five years later, a great praised Hurston biography was found in the book ruins by Robert E. Hemenway, and again made it a part of the American literature channel.
The remote road project came exactly at a time where Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the light of the public.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbor saw them as a retailer.
The municipality began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many returned for the celebration.
Some years later, the district turned off from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-spure remote road thrived the city, accelerated the whole with peak speed, wake up real bourgeois," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd expressed it a little simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
There came more and more trainers, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going here since 1993 into the church, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was recorded in 1998 in the historical register of the countrywide.
A new one-stage library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly planted and shunned Kennedy Boulevard.
Today Eatonville is still special in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlandos can sometimes feel like a backgasse in summer rain, as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She is now 90% black.)
Foreign looking for Eatonville's history and its importance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in the preface and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville’s oldest church, which was made by a wise and represents black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her fired community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston festival was larger, a higher degree of home prize was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as much as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, not worse or better and as proud, creative and diligent, albern and throughmixed as any other race and people in America.
It is the sincere love of this city, which can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklins Neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who has come back after the College to Eatonville to work in the city administration or at the police who could use some aid according to him.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who go through here will think: "Ah, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon newly on Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here we are talking to flowing financial leaver in New York.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers and the huge television screens in the Times Square, they would not even notice that they were in the middle of a debakel.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-tracking offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedgefond managers who have the monopoly in New York, they have the worst horror working day since 1929.
The suppliers continue to move with loud clops the metallen tea weaving along civic and transported tabletts that are charged with Muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still swallow between apartments, how human packets load with about the 50 shirts that hang on a joch-like Stange on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for their living conditions on their breakfast basket and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi at a week between 16 and 19 pm.
It didn't feel like a crisis until I decided to open a new saving account on Thursday on the basis of the world's end.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal, about 20 people were already snake.
Not to the money switches to retire or pay money, but on the customer service switch where family customers order cheque books, tourists for the way to buy house Macy's questions and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, later I learned from Starr, my "personal banking maker with license" stood for the same reason as I was serpent.
unlike me, however, they had already repealed their recruitment from smaller banks in places from where they were pendant, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and States Island.
They had money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building park), cosmoscoins and local parks that have only in a state of branches, and say that they treat their customers as family.
Last year, 15 these banks have been still and quietly pleaded.
During the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, over and as last Friday New Yorker went home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank who has saving facilities worth $440 billion, looking for a saved buyer.
In fear of another instortion, officers and shop workers who had been able to bring their bares to a bank that is considered as safe port, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases at Wall Street.
The normal New Yorker have been surrounded over the last few weeks.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese family-uper market took with so much confidence in Lehman Brothers, the Pleite went bank and their board chairman Dick Fuld, as if she would blast over a delicate colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old concierge of my living block, has come from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds" she told me after my visit to the bank.

Muslemic graves muslemic muslim bursts in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left judge of the Austrian Rights Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, member of the Belgian Rights Pertei Vlaam's importance, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp to represent the organization of "Stadts against Islamization".
They carry paintings in style of transport marks on which a mosque is trained, stripped with a red line.
The police accused legal ekstremists of the grave damage at a Muslim Cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extreme right parties represent significant profits in the parliamentary election of the country.
In the evening of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the Traun Court of Friedhof were severely damaged in a, according to police, organised action.
The perpetrators spared Jewish symbols such as the David star on some of the graves, but the criminal officials think this for an attempt to slew the motif of the extremists driven by hate on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said they were "to deeply shaken" about the message of grave damage that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, in Austria, a round of conscience research stands after the country exposed to the right in the established parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and Allianz for the future of Austria, the two parties who received almost 30% of the votes, set themselves in their election campaign for a strict anti-inwanderer law, and some of their voting claims were criticized by opponents as foreign hostiles.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, was prohibited by head towels and Burkas and even communicated his aversion to food that is commonly associated with Islam.
In his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent Islam's growth.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarettes with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analysis which have been carried out directly after the election and the fact that the extreme rights of the most politically strong block in the country indicate that this new development is based on young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter foreign travel block
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, who was sentenced to sexual abuse by children, was legally prohibited to travel to France and Spain.
Judges raised a six-month lock after informing the control authorities of him that he wanted to travel through France to Spain.
The police in Kent was granted last Thursday to retain a foreign voyage after submitting proof of the judges for slitters due to sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, right name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Office Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyer.
EIn the speaker of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police called on Kent at the Ashford Office to prevent foreign trips from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until March 25th.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
According to the register for sexual criminals, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Infringement of the authorities' notification could lead to a 5-year prison sentence.
Police in Kent said that she would not discuss individual cases or clusters of any place of residence in the country.
A speaker of Kent's police unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"Our view is it easier to control someone who is located in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the top concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kents and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex criminals in the country in order to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison because of abuse to 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years old.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was planning to take a flight to London.
But he didn't feel good and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the passing control and he fled after some time and again to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officers found that he returned to Britain.
Finally, on August 22, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's office court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked the approval to be required to register as a sexual punishment.
Glitter had previously been arrested in 1999 for 4 months in the United Kingdom because of the possession of child abuse images.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the Minister of Interior Jacqui Smith was satisfied and satisfied that Glitter was held to travel to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no smell, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the large flame cot dancers who refrain from concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or a man.
On the one hand, artist
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, in these moments that are stranger for the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures, the depth of a stolen view or pressure strength of the hands that are concerned because they are not entering the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer represents some inszenation on the stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. He was very little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flame coating at different levels.
The exhibition that belongs to the program of the month of Flamenco's photography,' reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which becomes growing from day to day, against', explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' 'every person can be any man, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Regular people on the portraits are artists who can pass pass on stage, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
To keep the personality of these artists, you don't have to make photos on stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What I was interested in creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to maintain the characters of the largest flame comaster with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made himself a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the variation function of the camera and the existing material, images created that remember classic photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, making the image the modernity and idea of how the Bauer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
This is not only the dance, the vocal or the instrumental game to itself, but the personality of the artist, his character that deducts the audience with his art.
The search for the essential thing, for a certain thing that is visible in the form of the hearing, the Heaven, and was the firm goal of this work, which is presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the next time.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vice Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Constructioners Leidenschaft to the portrait led him to take up this idea two years ago and realise it as 'Portraits of the veterans of the sports' (`SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me great pleasure to photograph people, learn them and place me in their living conditions, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think the portrait is the most difficult gender in the field of photography.
You tries or push on persons, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to make a photo.
In addition to these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to achieve my ideas."
The collection of flamenco's portraits today's »Flamenco-people' is issued in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and is in parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa knows that the Roma he just writes is 'a magnitude'.
He doesn't know where the Roman act takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to continue the project on which he is currently working, to advance a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland, who lived 20 years in the Congo and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred nobel prize producer admitted that the project he was busy 'a great-city' and 'all points to that he should not write the novel'.
'If I was solving, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at any time' he decided to participate at the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. During the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most excellent personalities on the third festival and made prognoses.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of Hay festival and which the most present ones gave their voice, will compare with the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and is seen in the Juan Bravo Theater.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had a audience before himself, which noticed that the Peruan who has a wonderful memory and great humor feeling had not given sufficient time to go through all the way: as his vocationalion to literature created from 'exceptive adventurelust', from `Freude at read' and from 'more experience than before'; as he writes and 'Disziplin' to supplement' the lack of inspiration', his intense work with documentation, numerous corrections and transparents that he makes; like Faulkner Hugo and ; as he wrote, and what 'Disziplin' it is the basis for his stories.
The hispano American novel writer admitted that there is no way and what you can measure and know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleasy experience', highlighted Vargas Llosa, who claims that it brings out 'effects' and 'the people even more out of each other', so I asked the writer 'so I don't leave the lightness' and' the responsibility' for his profession'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bulb campaigns fell partially.
After the announced bullet fighters found that the ground of the square was in bad condition, the bulb campaign, with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be completed, was relocated yesterday morning.
So the organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the stier campaign.
Thus, the festival of the inconsistency was suspended, why two of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, because of the second planned stier campaign, it could not be celebrated.
The group of the Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who continues to bear the bulls campfarena.
There was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who triumphed three ears, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, the Talavante met two hearings and a ear of the bull, which had succeeded him more by galopping than by his bulb art.
And even worse was El July, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, a large part of the audience responded to his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava two people wanted to escape the control of their car loadd by two thousand pounds of Haschisch.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen demanded the drivers of the car to stop, after which they took the flight.
It looked as if they had to stop the charge of more than two thousand pounds of Haschish.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the drivers who was 28 years old, known as A.A. J., as it told the Interior Ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trade and expiry of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the transport policy of the region Álava had already completed transport controls on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
She decided to keep a car in order to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the borders after a few kilometers. At the moment the drivers went out of the car to flee over a road to a forestry area.
Finally, the police of the city of Ertzaintza took one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers carried 2,178 Kilo Haschisch, which was taken up by the police.
The previous part of the car was charged with hazschi bundles, which were later guided to the exact laboratory analysis and to deviate the band to further police services.
In addition, the officials found that the marking was 'doublet', so that it did not comply with the marks specified in the Kfz papers, so that additionally a arrest was made for lapsing official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continues to investigate the arrest of the second suspect, which, as already mentioned, could flee but also to determine the origin of the contested drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. was taken into a police office and is presented to the prisoner in the next hour.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The actress Heather Locklear, known by the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (Kalifornia) because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
A Witness has observed how she was quite strangely trying to get out of her parking skirts in Montecito, reported speaker of California's transport policy to the 'People' magazine.
The Witness told more detail that Locklear 'after 16:30 p.m. gaspedal pressed and made much noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the park, and when she reared, she took some time on her sunbrille'.
Somewhat later the Witness, the beginning the actress probably didn't know that Locklear held on a nearby street and went off the car.
The Witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had lived 'Angst for Locklears'.
When the police strip came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood on the street and thus blocked traffic.
'They seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police into a special drug and alcohol center to test.
According to a police speaker, the actress had shown cooperative, excessive alcohol gap was excluded from the first moment. 'Their first observations of the officials followed, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine', says the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an indecisive substance that could not be determined and brought to a local investigation at 9 p.m..
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the clinic in Arizona, where she was treated against fears and depressions.
Llamazares is concerned that the andalusian association of the United Left will be responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and Members of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be those who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the City Hall in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had come back last week after he was accused to make business with family members.
'In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be those who must take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out what approach the party has to face the party who is sitting as the Council of City in the Council of Seville until now.
However, the President of the VR defended the need for ‘Transparency’ in the possible investigations of the rule infringements that Silva might have started: 'The VR was always aware that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this topic, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
'Sangre de mago: Hero book of Garci
Inspirated by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Př Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous rebellion against the French. This is a admirable film in filmography, with some 15 million euro investment for the rotating work.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to present 'a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he always admired in the works of the famous novel writer, today Carci explained in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the performers.
`Sangre de mago' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in Kinos and later shown on the sender Telemadrid as a four-hour miniserie.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to this rotation work, he made it possible to make Esperanza Aguirre, who appointed him three years ago by the autonomous community Madrid to turn a memorial film to the second century celebration on November 2, Madrid. Especially because the history was based on the basis of `Episodios Nacionales', it took the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was made by the autonomous Community Madrid for spinning work, offers Garci, as he added, the 'experience of decoration and corresponding clothing' to the image of the 'consistent Spain', which was the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been inflicted by the fight for independence and under the rule of the ferdinand of the VII.'
However, the Cineast regrets that with the financing like 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as with `Sangre de mayo'), some scenes could not be rotated from the rotating book with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci almost worked all his career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', participated in his ordinary work: he was on the stage of the actresses, with which you must first try to rotate before you start and for those who did not cascasing, he appeared 'demuting' and respecting', 'a part of the film director' is going to provide help in the theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you are working.'
Many performers he stands in `Sangre de mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar-Kandidat in four nominations (from which he won a one) is the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Nonetheless `Sangre de mayo', nor `See mesas de billar francés' and finally not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
'At the beginning you believe you're working for the offspring, you're later aware that it's only a lot of fun, and now you're satisfied when you've produced a movie', Garci explains more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón calls back to the dancer from SevilleMortola Valencia
A Flamencotancerin from Seville honors a dancer who is also from Seville.
CarmenEnrtola Valencia: Her father was Catalan (Florenç Mirtola Ferrer) and Mother Andalusier (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the quarter of Triana and when she was three years old, her family was moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert for oriental dancing.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for woman’s emancipation, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhistin, vegetarian, and was for the dismantling of the corsett, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón fascinated the life of this woman, who has left her traces at the Danish and Aesthetic Revolution in Europe in the period between the wars.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this role that seemed impossible to me.'
'We don't try to tell about her life without retaining their pride,' said the Flamencotancer.
Your dance bases helped me in Flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly' came to me, for example, like Guajira, or 'the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Your dance was sensely and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area', she claims.
Inszenation is calculated with two exceptional cooperations: Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel in one of its ideas, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco-Meister Matilde Coral, who would like to work with one of her ex-school students.
`Matilde plays misrtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored."
The inszenation also calculates with musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and cooperation with the actress Juanfra Júarez, he accepts the role of the artist who was divas.'
This work also tells us in a certain way about the life of this woman, which has been known in such far places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although it has usually lived in London.
'I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she's one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain epoch and their works are no more than knowing, and because of this, Bayón claims to know.'
Today, the idea will take place at the Lope de Vega Theater.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recjen casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recjen casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez 1916 Cenobia married, offers an appropriate atmosphere to perform planned activities in order to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the distribution of the literature nobel price and the death day of the two.
So the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international convention held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which she was at different locations in Andalusia, now reached New York and presented in the course of the international convention.
The andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recjen casado', issued by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Př-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poem more known.
U.S.A. can badly imagine without Paul Newman
`Manchtime God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation reporter', and from the then magnificent idea of the US-American cinema, which was left in the stich, came from all America to Newman with his exciting idea and followed it.
Let's see what she cost him to lend the Oscar.
And when he returned in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Yet, this was a big hit for everyone.
'What a person sometimes feels is much more than a expression, and now I lost a great friend', said Robert Redford crying, 'my life and my country were the greatest threats of his life.'
No one had feared not to be scared or overdrown.
As 'Vader' of the cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in which fears of terrorists and the market collapse in which the defeated self-value feeling of the American Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people can be admired, you must not necessarily be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he quasi made a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as many losses as well as gains: from the foundation that wrote the fight against drugs and to honor his son from the first marriage that died on overdose was founded until the own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took much effort to cope with a deadly diet culture.
A wide wave of surprising makes house high over Hollywood without consideration for nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Engländer Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a person died, but the whole era.
The Engländer Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize carrier, said that the work with Newman was no more or less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the wicked boy who came from Australia, waited to describe Newman as his greatest inspiration.
'Ons has left the greatest of all of us', George Clooney confirmed, perhaps one of the few who is trying to live today, like Paul Newman lived: receiving high requirements of righteousness, leading a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always simple or not even possible in today's media survey.
But there is someone who tried and Paul Newman was an example for this.
He had been divorced once and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there was certainly many possibilities not to be.
'Why should I eat a Hamburger on the street if I have at home Filet?' he often scared himself.
In heaven he will be proud of the fact that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, what is not necessarily common in America.
"With all the great roles he played, he was not so proud of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentionful opas and the one of the Philanthropen," they say.
For the Olympics, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the disappointment for 2012, maybe 2016.
But I ask myself: 'Do we be prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was described as a perfect street, and my assessment, she was the worst street with everything that was there.
Of course, this is a lot of ignorance if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could examine it would have not come through.
But, we're going through everything from the beginning.
The insane starts with the ticket picking up that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem to be bad either, but if they have already let you go, they should give you everything (including Chip to avoid the stand on the street).
So don't.
Here you can only get the ticket (the first instinct that is about to go for it only) and (after an infinite waiter) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second instinct because I needed the size of XL)
Where are we living?
Or is it so that after the crisis, only small, much cheaper shirts from less material was decided to buy?
So well, things like these are a small one compared to the days on the street.
Unless you need to go very early to get the chip, there's a waiter of at least 15 minutes and, additionally, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes, which is indispensable in the case of a road, where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the street started and we had not left our backpacks before it even if it was even successful, but it would be harder to recover.
In addition, during this 40 minutes of waiting, it seemed that there was an attempt to organize a people's uprising and overlap the house.
I think that tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people of lungs inflammation, and some like I will not even appear at the classification because of this chip I have received, I can already think that the output was misrepresented.
Of course, if you would ask me for a perfect street, this street would never intervene me.
So I think we'll be dreaming long by a city that's well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organised by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image identification system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as a taxi (or if Microsoft is a route planner to move on the campus of the company). The system notes what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face detection system, the 'receptionist' can recognize how many people in the room are, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen to and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also organize the attendees after the discussions into the groups.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' observes a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group conducting with her conversation, and that no company employer is also.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will soon listen.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now, the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, one talked very superficially about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computer had been equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling it with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be only for the winds.
Everything is just one detection when you remember that Microsoft added a function and 'Extras' in Windows versions.
The change in direction is worthwhile
Microsoft has the right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrom appeared in the net, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Sensitively, many point out that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an invisible part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can function simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or his husband, when it comes to communicating with his pregnant mother.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of his `Tod', not as a absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer will only start to run the Firefox, the Explorer or chrome and we spend more time on surf than in the environment of the »window'.
What half is available on the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be compact, much more compact than Vista.
Slight, not so exaggerated, less complex.
Microsoft's interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality they need this, without doubt, a little example for this.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the restoration rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshing drinking machine, a sign is attached: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of the employees in Microsoft used Google for accounting on the network.
Besides, last week has also been confirmed that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 has been ratified in delay.
It will not appear at the beginning but at the end of 2009, rather than even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility of bringing Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously to the brand.
Every day the phone turns to a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso used it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' of Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing a well built priest.
If we start to count up the countless stars performances, we can return to the picture of a very strong man, with a top bar that had increased in a hiking circular weight.
In principle, this is a typical male T-shirt from cotton, smellless and tailled.
However, the English speakers call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles exceeds all other brands.
First of all, because of his great name, it is called in the close circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the name development is connected with sports and is born by the Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surprises all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex tracks and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (almost recognisable) that this T-shirt has as detail on the neckcut.
And respectful, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Caschmire, Hoses of Cotton, T-Shirts with stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwashes.
Although it is very harmful to use it as undercover.
They're very ridiculous.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister, she did not prevent her own personality.
Monthica Cruz is delightful, but full of life.
At present, the Sisters, Gruz, take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monthica this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who preserve their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of Mango, then her residence and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion that sponsored the Spanish fashion house.
Barmherish and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/Winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner to Valentinos honor.
A very intense working time at the same time is exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the film of the 50 and 60 years; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and observed women as they are dressed as they combine their clothing pieces, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything takes place in one place, and these areas have many commonities.
Since I was young, I was excited of clothing; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to swallow my aunt into the clothing limits and see her clothes.
It was super to go almost better than a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to care for clothing.
You know, we dancers like having our own style in teaching and with the samples to look into the mirror and feel good at it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you're moved to the real artist role.
Finally, everything is connected to each other, it is so, much respect for the costume designers and their professionality.
You've been 30 years ago, you didn't get into a crisis?
Oh, yeah.
I feel better than ever, than thirty-year-old I feel good.
I find the woman will mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I have made the things I have been young since I was young, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, do you think to become a mother, right?
For a long time I know that I will be mother, because this requires my body, and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to leave me away.
I don't worry about the candidate.
I will give my child great happiness and exercising it with a lot of love.
As regards film art, you keep in mind the works you took and have been rotated last year.
That is exactly the case, and I would like very much that they are presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theatre, am very impatient and unruhful and wants everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' are listed for the first time.
See how they like you
A few days ago you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
I'm fine, don't say anything like that.
It's not that I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, which I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to participate in a parade for the well-being event of her organization 'Frauen for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know that two clothings were sent from our collection for Mango to collect the money for Naomis NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, like the one who knows she, would tell you that she doesn't agree.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this great thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a hand, I will also do that.
In order to support women in the third world, what is necessary.
The drivers who can be reduced because of the alcohol level will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The Authority recommends that the driver who had three official penalties due to the alcohol level is installed in his car, which forbids him to start the car in the drunk condition. If he is alcoholized, the car will not skip.
The initiative has already been announced in June last month and is now part of the report of the General State Advocate, which is a pilot project which will last for a year.
The purpose is the driver's resocialisation, and this is why it receives a course for the rehabilitation of transport behaviour.
The Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institution for Safety of the Automobile will also participate in this, except the Advocate General State Prosecutor.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the car drivers who were shown more than one time because of driving under alcohol influencing, resumed tax.
The 'alcolock' would prevent it because it is a system connected to the car, it misss the alcohol content in the exhausted air and prevents autostart when the driver has made alcohol tests; or if a alcohol concentration is detected higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are carried by those related to sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices have been prevented in the first year after its introduction to 65% of the rule infringements.
In Spain it is expected that 115 human life could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take this behaviour before it became a crime.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be realized in the normal way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device on the Spanish markets is still available in no business, although it was already built in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
In the morning, the Parliament will vote for the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Worker Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been made in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-tos'
With British scores at 17:40 p.m., the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the plane of the Spanish air weapon, traveling with the Prince and Prince of Asturia.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair that came out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Embassy and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi rider on the street whether he knew that the Prince and the Prince of Asturia visited the city to form the official journey.
- Ah, very well, so that you can't take any people at the airport this time you're from here or so.
No, she's the spaniard, but she lived a few years here.
- All right, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who is the Prince and the Prince of Asturia and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in Hangar of the airport and the red carpet, also military protection from 27 soldiers of the marine.
The front appears laughing, clothed in marine blue, and she, the forstin, with long hair waisted by the wind, without normal 'peep-tos', may have been told that it is expected to be a dizzle in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official order is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, they wait for a reporter from the Mexican television that likes to make scarce.
The best premium of the fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designer and bonuses than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded by the amount of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, has seen her drawings yesterday at the Mango Filiale on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
Furthermore, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has been opened recently. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have been happening, which have been linked to thanking the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table, organized by Mango, seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the hard heart that was broken by the pain because his brother recently died, collapsed. He attracted the attraction from the fashion house and used some jewelry matter of ELAH who were breathtaking. He held at the arm of his son Luis, who is nearly two meters large and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the house Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended together with the Baron of Rotschild without Jackets, for Jacketts gave them the ladys.
Monthica Cruz, had a shirt and a shirt, which she self modeled, and to dinner they wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballett samples, so she was excited, reminded of the old times, grabbed a bar and made a kind of `grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, the passage of the palace was not closed, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning, we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always calls out a sturmic enthusiasm and on Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own beds and towels) in the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked to have a room without smell.
The stars under the starful heaven of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Rate against stress
There is not 1000, but a possibility more to forget chaotic about our racing daily life.
And if there are a few, all are collected in a book, in which it stands as to relax. The book comes into the books on 30 September.
The Wecker is a penalty when he complains at 7 p.m., but even worse the idea appears to enter into the hectic rhythm, which requires the current life.
The office means the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one and not two methods to fight the daily evaporation and the problems of the workplace.
However, the number increases, not more and less than 1001.
In addition to yoga renderings, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book represents the entire list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against the stress is called `1001 opportunities to relax' and so comes the peace that gives the book into the books of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Those who think it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas such as work with the help of personal contacts, this manual contradicts such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to remain in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenal in your Venet no longer increases to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to set up on sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Speaking in Sleep
Some Children Speak Nights
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened on the day before, but the children speaking during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be afraid, but in reality this has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially with children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you was told that you spoken at night.
This phenomenon can occasionally occur (a time in life, such as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month in the month), the child can remember nothing on the next day.
There is no reason to cause this phenomenon.
Frequently, cohesions are searched with other appearances in sleep, such as Alptrooms, panic fear nights, Enuresis noctura (Bettnits nights), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we have already mentioned it, it can be very high fiber, stress situations, or conquest.
In any case, this is a little investigated phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very varied.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, flüsters, or it can be quite an opposite (wheel, wines, long discussions).
In the cases when the statement is very intense, it is recommended to watch the child and advise him with a specialist to check if a problem is about what causes fear and in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disturbance, so it is not treated unless it is linked to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoe or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Don't try to exult the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
For nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods may be used to help them get some inner tranquility.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
Once the speaking happens in the sleep, try to keep the rest.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be able to remember nothing that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is unusual because the child is unconscious, so you will break it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so rests.
Think of when it shows fearful appearances, it is recommended to advise or find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child is not pressured to perform an entertainment and get out more information.
So you will not be able to achieve it because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
In addition, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it says that they are careful about the interpretation of information and the conclusions that you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear the night and know his secrets.
Not even as a scar.
That's a lot of fear.
So, don't worry about you, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Ill houses.
After a long thirst track, ill houses on the game field are finally back on success course.
Without an effort, the yellow blacks played numerous torchances and made it possible to make one of them, and so win the game.
The tempo of this encounter, during which the attackers had effort to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack of the guest captain purchaser, whose remote committee just over the angle passes, ill houses with ease should dominate the game, and it has been alternating first flowflick with a remote committee, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shoe with the footspitze to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opponent team blocked in the middle of the field and only left the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half-time should be crucial with first two torchances fought by Riahi and Temporal, and right afterwards with the first gate for the ill houses by Marais, which was precisely right to resume a ball that was rejected in a first attempt from Diebold.
But the illheusian gatekeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank for about 12 minutes later, so that his teammates had to continue to play underlying.
Denmark, however, did not use this and did not face a illhaeus eleph, which only had a little back in order to have their defense to 'defence', except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the late.
Sarkozy meets delicate fishermen
Before fleeing into the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will still make an absorption in the Bretagne.
In view of the decisive position of fishermen, who blocked the missions to several British and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to find themselves in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives there.
Last promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit', and hope he comes with 'concrete proposals'.
The visit of the President takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, which was founded by the British fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the Diesel price which has reached a record value of over EUR 1.14 per liter.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon', the President will discuss possible solutions with them in order to help their firms become competitive again, and to ensure the working conditions and payment of the sailors'.
Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning they started in Morbihan and Calvados Protestmarch, which caused the stairs of nearly ten kilometers of length.
Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break off.
The Quiberon peninsula was limited with a lock.
On Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning matures and pallets before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the drum canal, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not go outside, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the trade ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique retained the blockade of the major total racfinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before it decides about possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to movement and its participation in the debate planned at the Paris Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheries.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsible of the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen are not going to pass' and 'will not go to Paris', for example Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently costs about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died in the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.

Embraer holds his delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer this year calculates 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threatening recession, as a risk for the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft producer in the world, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much of the Chinese market, especially for its planes of size orders from 30 to 120 seats.
Until today, Embraer 41 machinery has delivered to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
The Sunday expenditure of the Financial Times indicates that the insurer American International Group, who was financially supported by the American Currency Authority, considers to pay more than 15% of its assets in order to reimburse the 85 billion dollars that were proposed to it.
AIG is ready to apply the sale of a large part of its businesses, their life insurance at international level and their age care in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
No confirmation could be made at the AIG.
The Aktiva, which might be separated by AIG, belongs to its plane lease-Firal International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of transatlantic holdings, as well as its real estate and its investments in private equity, continues the FT.
With regard to such sales, no final decision has been made, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly operate the sales in order to reimburse the loans over 85 billion granted to it, including the risk that the American authorities receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders are lost in the same degree.
Analysis Historical Paris of the Historical Morning Meeting
The New York stock exchange reported on Monday after the representative chamber had rejected the plan Paulson for the rescue of the banks, a historical case of courses: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of nearly 800 points, and the nosday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As far as the points were concerned, the most strong case of his history (684,81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of trade deterioration after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final payments, the index of Nasday, mainly technology, is reduced to 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the widely spreading index of standard&Poors 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected refusal of the plan for the rescue of the banks by the Chamber of Members, which should be able to enable stability on the markets, the Wall Street, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter, broke together.
With 228 votes, and 205 for this, Members refused to the financial secretary Henry Paulson the means he had asked for.
Nearly two of three Republicans refused his plan.
'There is a bad picture that makes the Congress as inadequate to take a plan', said Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market was counting on this plan', added it, and feared that a project adopted in several days 'to late' comes.
'If the project is actually condemned to fail (...), it will soon be the task of Fed (the American Central Bank, Anm. Red.) and other central banks, to get the crisis in the hand, which would be even more restricted to the credit conditions', Brian Bethune warned, economic head of Global Insight.
And Ms Piegza emphasized the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day it reaches, the ruins of a financial company' in the United States 'within'.
After the Washington Mutual concession on Friday, the U.S. authorities planned to buy the watchovia banking operations through its competitive Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign of viewing the markets 'not only a world crisis', added to the analytics of the FTN financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenues of the public cassette within ten years have decreased from 3.632% on Friday evening to 3.827% within 30 years of last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first television show
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday followed another to find out who came out as winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs for the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats declared their own victory in this television show, which should be pursued by a third of the American families.
The political analytical David Gergen estimated that John McCain's performance, although quite profoundly, was not `brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the election surveys five weeks before the presidency elections.
The Gallup Institute, which was released on Saturday a survey of opinions that, according to Obama, is five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat makes clearly the better figure.
In the yet unresolutioned choosers, so to those who now arrive, Obama came out of the survey with 39%, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
'It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instinct, but this weekend Bill Clinton warned.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not stop moving its inconsistent experience in the field of foreign policy, making it clear to underline the 'Naivity' of his opponent on these issues that formed the focus of this first television show.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that,' he emphasized several times.
'I don't believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and the knowledge needed to become President', he also assured.
A attack point which has been preached in the republican campaign spots last yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself short and precisely without letting himself out of the text.
He moved his ability to make good decisions and renew the picture the world of the United States.
`McCain has still not understood, however, Obama', this weekend was a democratic cuisine, against which the Republican was suspended, not to have recorded the entire extent of the crisis that lasts from the street on the 'American.
"When the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama preferred 200,000 people who had gathered together at the time of a election event in North Carolina in streaming rain.
He did not even mention the words 'meaning' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis of Obama, which the Americans consider the most appropriate to save the economy even at the edge of the base, makes a clear advantage.
'The next week could represent a crucial turnpoint', estimated yesterday the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton Government, compared the 'good economic instinctte' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-year poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After again he stressed that he might even create the taxes for 95% of the Americans despite the rates in the Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a potential energetic independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, would be the highest priority for him.
On the other hand, McCain wanted to set up a 45 core power plant until 2030.
The two candidates are considering the issues adopted by the convention last night and the people are extremely unloved.
Did you notice that in Minsk a choice took place?
Young people and oppositional demonstrated Sunday evening at the main place of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Some hundred White Rounds gathered on the Minsk market market on Sunday evening to protest against the misleading nature of Parliament elections since the closing of the elections.
Although there was no result yet announced, many young people came to demonstrate the power of Alexander Lukachenko: `The dictator should come back'.
Some admit that they have not chosen: 'What does it use if they do with my voice what they want', says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown the foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-distribution of Visa for 40 leading whiterussian personalities and certain assets, could be repealed if these elections were estimated by the observers as clean.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
'We were excluded by the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counterparty', regretted Potemkin, press speakers of the Union democratic forces, a theerogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, highlights Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the presidency election 2006 and leader of pro-European movement, because it is important who chooses the voices, and with us this is the executive.
When Members take the opposition into Parliament, they were appointed and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean transmitting time in the television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty to interfere with the political game because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
For if our economy, which is strongly guilty against Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger to become a proprietary gateway of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.'
Opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the election, does not recognise the choice as valid.
It emphasizes that the number of elections appear too high and that the extension of the voting fee in advance (26% of Minsk's electors) has made the way for any kind of manipulation.
Did you notice that a choice took place?, asked the leader of the Social Democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the two last political prisoners who were released this year in August.
There was no one in the election places.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, and those who meet the best of the government's ideas."
The silence of the night retracts over the October site.
In TV, President Lukachenko and members of the central election commission are happy to succeed.
Understanding - From blood that has been safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the most secure and efficient blood banks in the world.
And, above all, she rejoiced the public's trust that was difficultly shaken by the shame of the infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the blood-pending service of the Canadian red cross were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Given this drama and the unreasonableness of the public, the Government of Canada in February 1994 launched a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light into the circumstances leading to such a tragedy, and developing directives to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever still delayed to submit his report, several provinces then put a committee on the legs, whose goal it was to develop a new system for the administration of blood conservation in Canada.
In Quebec the Committee Gélineau fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to provide the other provinces and the two areas.
'1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers.
The situation was discouraging.
Because of the enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood conservation and through the work on this area during the following years, we have rejoiced the public's trust before they proudly emphasized that almost 94% of Quebec's people’s trust in Hema-Quebec at the beginning of 2008.
Dr. Décary, however, maintains consciousness that `Trust is something extremely broken'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec acts according to the principle of caution.
At this time, we met the appearance of numerous cases of human form of cattle in Europe, a new kind of creautfeldt jakob disease, this woman who has been invented since the creation of 1998.
'And we did not have the least idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we refer to one of the main directives of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which are used by exclusion measures, if you don't know this and if a disease continues slowly, as it appears to be the case in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which leads to death.
So in April 1999 no blood of persons who had been held in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 were assumed.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proved that this disease is transmitted over the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution we applied has a sense.
In 1999, a much more precise technology on the market appeared to identify HIV: The nucleic acid tests (NST) allowing the prevention of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor and not the antibodies against the virus as it was the case with the tests used before.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time, which took place between the time when the person was infected and that when the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it and you could not recognize it was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transferring AIDS via transfusion.
Today, one of 12 million people is in danger of receiving HIV infected blood.
'With other words, it means that 12 million blood preserves should be distributed before someone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributed between 40,000 and 5000,000 blood conservations each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs where HIV was transferred via a blood conservation.
I think that today you can feel good when you get a blood transfusion or write to restore health,' says the Hema-Quebec director.
»Our challenge for the next ten years is to get the safety of our products.
Never know which illness agent can get into the system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya virus has been raised on the island of Réunion, which, as is the Westnil virus, is transmitted through insects over the blood.
We need to monitor untrustedly," Dr. Décary continues before she stresses that hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supply in addition to a safe supply.
'The need rises because the population is ageing.
As cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood leaflets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood retirement network, which is only 3% of the people suitable for the blood loss of Quebec. '
Each healthy person, who is 18 years or older and fulfils the adaptation criteria, can spend blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
In the average, 14% of those who make their blood available will not be accepted because they are diseased by AIDS or malaria, and those who are traveled into a country in which malaria is spread for a year is excluded.
'With this 3% we create a inventor that meets the needs of the hospitals.
Missing supplies are very rare.
But you need to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and cannot spend blood anymore.
It is difficult to convince people of spending blood, but above all, to keep them and bring them to become regular donors.
Today, life is so hectic that you rarely find the time to spend an hour during blood loss," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conservation but also human tissues, including bones transplants, heart collapses, augapses and skins used almost exclusively in severe fire injuries.
These tissues are studied, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public Nabel scrnurblutbank of Quebec.
In the nabel snur, which was previously regarded as biomedical waste, stem cells are rich blood that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
'A few weeks ago, we celebrated our thousands of nail stroke tests, and we plan to take more than a thousand annually.
'We should probably begin to make it available for transplantations at the beginning of the next year' Dr. Décary, which describes this Nabelschnurblut programme as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the Halffinale
Montreal's Impact has been against the sounders from Seattle at the second time, thanks to a 3 to 1-Sieges (4 to 3 with all gates) and decided to play the quadrantfinal series in the Saputo city, where the overall torries were qualified for the semifinal round of the excretion games of the first Liga of the USL.
The Central Field Player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the ninetiesth minute.
After a first half time without a gate for both the one and the other side, the Central Field Players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other results for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who left Matt Jordan for the sounders.
Remember that the first game of the previous and return series on Friday Impact had inserted a 2 to 1-deposit at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a pre-location of Seattles.
In the semifinal Impact is measured with the Vancouver White Caps.
On Saturday evening, Thunder could compensate a 3-to 1-defizit by a 4-3-seat, but the Whitecaps moved into the semi-final round with a totaltor ratio of 5-4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series are set today.
Shortly said - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number 1-Trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last night, Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plazanec and Andrej Kostitsyn trained the attack on the Panther from Florida with a stormfire, which led to a 3 to twosieg.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plazanec delivered two templates and Kovalev changed a pass in this game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparation games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only gate of the entire shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, warned the Russian.
I need another game so I feel good."
`He has fixed too much on it in the first half, noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received sturmic casualties. '
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not decide to introduce elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon yesterday in Quebec, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (Linke) tries to be chosen in today’s part-option.
This is the long-term goal, which Jean Charest presented with visual means at the General Assembly of the Quebec liberal Party in Levis last major border: this is the long-term goal, which was presented by the Jean Charest yesterday.
During his lecture, he was projected a kind of picturesmill.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of water power plants, mining works, viewed by Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as well as during the election period.
Against the press, the Prime Minister refused to decide that he will take the elections this autumn even if he said that his appointment was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision', which the Prime Minister is supposed to have for Quebec, namely the 'new economic space', which represents a agreement with France on labour forces, a agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it was often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches in recent times, the opening of the North - the northern area in the 49th degree - has never been a subject of presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explain why the north 'a jewel with enormous potential' was, but no date, no investment figures or exact priorities for the coming projects.
A maximum of some views on what could be done: especially in water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, the growth of the countries of thresholds and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to the recording of Mr Charests, the north ́Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titan and even diamonds'.
This `zone twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not only in our neighborhood, it's in us, he stressed how to show clearly that he is looking for a national reasoning space.
Quebec has grown greatly through his link to the north, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitibi, the Quebec technology, the James Book.
'It belongs to us, it's our future', he added after he had inserted a theatrical break to consider the huge card behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec area, including a part of Labrador, which had always requested Quebec, explained to the Press Prime Minister.
`This is a traditional attitude that persecuted all governments.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a long time when the opportunity is to resume this position on behalf of the government', he explained.
In addition, 'with climate change we need to reconsider our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the northwest passage that will be driven throughout the year.
Before this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the region, the incarnants, and the inuit?
The Prime Minister said that Quebec's government would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly pexist representatives of Ungava) have already initiated consultations in some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pellet Pellet, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Fundaments) takes an important place, took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large congregation, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to create 'man' a common vision'.
The development of the North will, on the other hand, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Nord plan will be 'speaking, regulated and environmentally', he promised.
Jean Charest described this `Vision' as if they were a continuation of the liberal minister of Prime Ministers who were before him.
'How the liberals who were before us in office, we have thought about changing the challenges into new growth and development changes.
This was one of the ever again thrown topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the acquisition of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the adopted decisions proposes to rename the power plant of Beauharnois into Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
'With Godbout, who created hydro-Quebec, about reading that reached the silent revolution and the constitution of water electricity, Bourassa, who made the James book, our party always knew to determine the future', Jean Charest explained.
He was referring to another conservative project this time to the program 'Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
As regards the project Waterkraftstaudum Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest emphasizes that its operation was intended for 2012.
'This remains among us, but I prefered to be in it', he trusted his party members, which came out with those casual towers.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no choices in 2008, and certainly 2009, in fact has not yet been the opportunity to hold down a choice of what is possible from the law.
He stresses that his appointment calendar is full, however, especially because of the mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the Weekend provided a platform from nationalist plans, especially in 'the Constitution', which was adopted without any other means: The PLQ calls for particularly the recognition of the 'Specificity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
She also wishes that Quebec's members of the Council of Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications are appointed and that they have a veto relating to the decisions taken in Quebec.
The Opposition Guidelines of the North Plan were included with skepsis.
The Chief of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, revealed the policy on the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Government introduced Landry 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when she came to power in 2003, has failed to apply it.
If she had done it, 'we wished much further today', Mrs. Marois judged on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed itself to support the adoption of a plan north by the government.
'But what we want is that this will not only be a great idea', said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - An entrepreneured country
Mr Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz'-Minister (who Irony) was in the cabinet Harper who allowed her to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada last summer.
This woman, who has led a non-willing fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker itself.
We have to do this with a government that, as the only part of all the countries concerned, has not picked up their land's prisoner at home in the concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that were forgotten to him.
The only government that, despite the signing of the Geneva Convention, has breached its word and lets a child's solution be found under unhuman conditions.
The only one who turns down to a justice parody to estimate the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International, and the association of Canadian lawyers plead for getting Omar Khadr home, so that he can get a fair process in Canada.
This government also closes the eyes before the torture: it's little interested that a young adult will certainly be broken forever after so many years.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are experienceing a secretive cutting of our rights, our freedom and our `democracy', this word, the harper constantly wear like a flag before us, and that sounds inevitable from his mouth.
So it has come the time when there is no more morality: one may be randomly mishandeld, torture and lock, even after a head of government, who is only supported by minority until today (they may be very minor after the 14th of October).
Many choosers believe to find her healing at a party who preachs virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has dismissed from what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr Tows, the shame lies in this discharge, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The orwellic speech of Barrick Gold
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms and pursues an orwellic logic that the world's largest gold profitation company aimed at opening a 'public transparent debate' for six million against three authors and a small mediumless publishing house.
If it is true that the Judges are independent and inpartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slandering complaints, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was totally disappeared by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, to drive everyone in the ruin that waits to represent one of its opposite opinions.
Regardless of the process, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada have to spend significant sums to prepare their defense and fight with very inequal weapons against a army of lawyers who are paid from the almost inadequate bags of gold mines.
On the other hand, the tactics of these inequal battles are often to ruin the defendants to force a uniform arrangement that makes the opposite side and, in addition, fears everyone who waits to re-establish the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on in many of the countries in which Barrick is working gold, Canada is usually discussed by the exchange of ideas and not by kneephibe.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had opened its books and documents and had opened a real debate, by newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams that could have led light to this question.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and wears the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Can Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time, and does it disagree with the opinions of the public?
Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice-President only includes the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all the Canadians; a very beautiful view of the concept.
In a democracy, self-delegers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada is, in particular, doing this because it rejects the brutal position of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a frame that many have been challenging as a knee (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just directed a claim to the authors of Noir Canada in which they demand not to use this term anymore...).
In addition to the surreal speech of Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the fact that is fundamental for each democratic society.
They disbelieve the right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to research and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead this by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The universities of which we belong, knows that we have long debates and unanimousities have been addressing and resolving conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unrelatable complaint clearly shows that, in contrast to what she suggests, she does not have a desire to have a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take action that restricts this kind of unjustified complaints.
Sales Action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The Bush Administration and the Governing Congress Deputy, Republicans and Democrats, finally agreed yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of over 700 billion US dollars to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaking Wall Street for months, must still be accepted by the two congress chambers.
The main content are: a better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the return of the public funds used, new available to reduce the number of houses which are planted due to payment, as well as the right to monitor the holders who are paid to the staff of the supported companies.
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber, and the representatives of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a second day marathon of negotiations.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective', said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
`It was all about to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis at the Wall Street', said the democratin.
`This is the basic point: If we don't do this, the dreama, the chaos and the unreasons in the daily life of the Americans will be enormous,' said the Republican Judd Gregg.
In the last two hours, negotiations had been accelerated, because of the fear of the effect that had been renewed to the absorption of the investors.
The time limit agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two U.S. Presidential candidates who were participating in the negotiations showed themselves rather than the supporters of the agreement, but without failing to express their satisfaction on the need to take them in this extreme way.
The democratic senator Barrack Obama was on the addition of some available to agree, especially those to enable owners to maintain their homes and those relating to the holders of the governing employees of the state-saving companies.
'If you ask the taxpayers to take exceptional measures due to the unreasonableness of certain persons, that is nothing to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary', he said on the American television broadcasters.
When he was asked on another sender whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details, but I hope it.
'The guides I have read' show that this is a thing that we all will have to have to divorce, and with which we will be able to go ahead.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable,' he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at dealing with the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, caused by the spaces of a real estate blast, which first led to the collapse of risk-rich mortgage credits (Subprime) before extending to further forms of more widened bonds (PCA) and finally organized into a freezing of financial power and in the ruin of banks and money institutions.
A group of Republican Members was that last week had failed the first attempt to agree.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' actives of society in distress should only be secured by the government and not purchased, the baggasse is believed to escape.
In order to cut off the angle for all the conventions, one has also added one available, which states that if the government should make losses with this programme within five years, it could then recover new taxes in order to retain its own capital used.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can add to another 100 billion if the President looks at it for necessary.
The payment of more than 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed vote by the Congress.
In return to his aid, Washington receives shares in the supported company that brings him in the case of profits dividends, and which can sell it again if the storm is crossed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to retain the preferential procedures relating to the apartments bound to the real estate credits affected by this plan, and to establish periods for reimbursement and inventions which are paid to the governing employees of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Members to vote on him today, and the Senat then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that her plan will receive green light.
In fact, further votes have come against this project, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
'Ganz clearly does not understand Washington', said the Republican Scott Garett, member of the Board's financial commission, his voters.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who exist in asking the taxpayers to the cash'.
Brad Sherman, head of a group of conventions called 'the coukus of the creators', represents things different, but it is the same conclusion.
'Vier hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, have written us to tell us: We ask the Congress not to be put under pressure, and to carefully consider what way is to be put', he explained yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we received evidence that this is a global crisis.
At a emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion US dollars).
The registration of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank announced BNP Paribas that it would fail to buy their competitor who is in great difficulties since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis by risk-rich real estate credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85.000 people and belongs to the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'That's not a lost money, explained yesterday the Dutch financial minister Wouter Bos.
In order to compensate, we get a voting right and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savings and households appreciate now as uncertain times are proclaiming."
During this time, the British government was just about to state another bank in distressed by the financial crisis on the other side of the diamond.
According to the English press, the government would take all the current loans at the Bank Bradford and Breley, over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that she would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged Icon
His beauty with the azurculous eyes was long his truff, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free themselves with the charming smile from the Nazi mirror?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensitivity, and an obvious talent have just kept him even away from a power position that brings the really fearful monsters to the world.
But what a big runner!
Paul Newman died on Friday aged 83 years of the consequences of long cancer on his ranch in Connecticut remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he liked and was a kind of Rivale on the canvas for which he was a kind of rival, more carefully in his play, certainly even more crushed, but as a apostle of freedom and speech dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often gives wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as a son of a German Jews and an ungarish mother.
From its European roots, one of the ruhmy faces of the American dream should be created.
Without excessive ego, extremely quality characteristic.
Because in him, a whole country, who was in love with the self-made-man, reflected in the fighters who were injured in the Pacific War, studied in Yale in the beginning of the 50s and then visited the actor's studio in New York before he had success in the theatre, television and soon in the cinema.
This man, who was fighting for civil rights, was also the driver who became a 24-hour race of Mans Second in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a fine relationship with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
It also disappears the unknown facetten of this mystery, retaining, engaged, and compared to the glamour of the showbusiness oversensitive star, whose puzzle you will never solve perfectly.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death Paul Newmans put the cinema makers of this weekend in Taumel, while on the dark screen of the memories all his great roles were played.
More than a half century American film art in constant change passes with him.
Then the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) in memory, and the young man who resigns his sensely wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to The cat on the hot roof that was filmed in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
It will be a much shorter remembrance (1990) that is awakened to his sensitive Mr Bridge, who is distorted by a wedding in his high age, who did not fulfil all of its promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from somebody up there Likes Me (a hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean after his death was resumed and made known to Newman 1956 correctly.
This sympathetic ganov in the magnificent The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar in 1973 for the best film.
As a bitter and racing Billard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times he was.
He's still.
In his lifetime, epochs are united.
The youth knows him mainly from the Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunloop, the little orthodox trainer of an iceockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brother Coen in 1994.
With a last role in 2003 as a Pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
In contrast to several cinema-loyers who have withdrawn early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the seat for a long time, with Hollywood, his property, his princing and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without Humor, as a living challenge to the 'Anderplaying' when he judged his very express performances.
The meter was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to flee the roles for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as a foreigner: neurotics, alcoholics, fossils or desperates, with their perfect representation he reflected his revelation and reflected his relevance.
As a regisseur, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true fine sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, marked a fine women's portrait full of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott through an overdose was dedicated to his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of fine feeling and sadness.
At the Flood of Honorings, who had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid yesterday, his close friend and former army companion explained: 'He has improved my life and this country.'
Greatness and enjoyment of life were essential characteristics of the dead actress.
In addition to his legendary career, a great defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, is now going thereafter, an opponent of the Abdrift Hollywood.
We often saw him with the foot in scales full of vinavired, in greys, bags or other foods, and this was quite tasteless, although we found it even fun.
However, the profits from its sales flown into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Immer and to the end, your father was incrediblely grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. '
And for us it was an honor to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actress.
A prestigious citizen, in the nearest and most widely sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October the negotiations in the criminal process against János will begin ascending and complicated.
The accused shall, in particular, prevent the participation in organised crime, and gross harmful and commercial fraud, and other criminal acts, including document falseization.
According to State prosecution, the funds employed from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often used with false accounts.
State funds and subsidies from the self-administration - total HUF 65 million - are intended to be partly in the case of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly fled into the private cases of individuals.
The investigation authorities stated that in relation to the tendering fees, the associations should not have been complied with their obligations.
According to the claim, a large number of accounts should have been false.
The accounting blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, which was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies should be issued the accounts was decided on that trip north from the plate lados to which Isván Lados was sent by János.
During this "exploratory tour" Lados should make guests and restaurants find out.
He required accounts on the consumers to be able to post accounts based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Social and Working Ministry, and self-management of Budapest.
These accounts are intended to have been manipulated by István Lados and its complicate, András ›ri, which should have been responsible for our information on the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "Accounting Tour" was a beer place.
As two accounts issued by grant and co in 2003, the gastronomy company is supposed to have carried out the ninety-knowledged group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
Now, however, the head of the company suggests that such a large group would not have been able to fit into the local.
Another invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövřért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also revealed grave form and content errors.
In a guest pension in Badacsonytomaj, which only has three rooms and cannot stay more than ten people at the same time, there should be 130 guests in charge.
The fantasy of the accountfälgers seemed to have no limits when it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting documents the clients Jobb Jöv>>eng<<ért and Hoppá haven't even seemed to appear, according to the accusation authority.
As director of the company Gyřzř Farkas told the hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that it was false documents when it was submitted by the prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were incorrectly fitted on the steal."
And further: In addition to form mistakes, the fact was also wrong that the operation should have stored one hundred people after totally 11 rooms, which are impossible to provide so many people.
Also, the restaurant was not in operation anymore for a long time.
They have also agreed to verify that the Budapest Travel Office, taken by them, offers only travel to the abroad, so they have indicated Hungary demands on the cash payment account, which is in contrast with the accounting practice of the company.
As known as during the investigations, they have also launched the tax on VAT on the accounts, although travel agencies relating to a country outside the EU are taxable.
The amount of VAT was in total to four accounts issued by the Hotel Révffüp Kft. to the Jobb Jövéort Foundation, as the company calculated only 15 percent VAT instead of 25, and also are issued by the employees exclusively machine accounts, but the false documents were hand-written.
A further error that had been made to the "computer" was that they had stated as a performance given in a case of "war transport", although this was not offered by the company specialized on investment advice, the prosecutor shared.
Further form errors - false accounting format, wrong steal - were due to the fact that the accounts issued in Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány as well as XXI. Századi cultureális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be distributed as lapítvány.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managers did never devoted the accounts.
Another "failure" is the case with the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was at the time (2001) in resolution when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület should have eaten there - the mass manager therefore suggested not to have issued the accounts itself.
consciously faked
The other group of investors are those who were quite aware that they had to put fictional accounts.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for Együtt a Harmadic Évezredért Foundation has issued in a height of approximately 4 million HUF.
According to the accusation, the director of Collab Kft. was left by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to show the fictional accounts.
The currently available biogate Kft. should also have worked together with tariffs and co. in 2003: In 2003, the GmbH intends to provide the Jobb Jövřért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Presence Egyesület associations with false accounts in the total value of HUF 5 million.
However, there was as little payment as the accounts were canceled immediately after their exhibition, which the concerned have forgotten in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall include persons directly contacted with the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postboat of the Ukraine Managing Director of the Delta Trió Kft., an in Budapest, but not found fuel and vehicle trade company.
In the period from October to December 2005, this company should have issued several accounts on the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF about 18 million.
According to the investigation authority, the Cash Investment Kft., found in Liquidation since 14 September 2005, should have operated as a buyer of these accounts.
The company's director was a rumine, which was also supposed to be made by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov was established during the investigations, accounts on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and to have cast their counter-values.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft, as well as the Jos-Investment Bt, are intended to be founded by Romanian Maurers on Iván Kubatov's express desire.
In reality, however, none of these companies was active, which was according to the disadvantaged contracts.
However, he was able to benefit from the company: On request of his complicate, the lawyer of Zsolt scene, who was responsible for preparing the company's beneficiary documents, he carried out accounts on the associations associated with the associations, such as atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov should have issued 15 accounts in the total value of HUF 14,2 million on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The prosecution assumes that Kubatov could have collapsed 10% of the sum of accounts and the tax on VAT.
Cutov should even have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional accounts - in this case the accounts were attached to the application of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért have issued their applications in January 2006 in the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received per 5000,000 forint, but these amounts have benefited strangely.
To do so, they presented the TMA five fictional accounts of the Works Team Kft.
In addition, these accounts were ensured in the Ministry of Teaching in the Árpád Kemecsei office.
The negotiations are now counted by some accused people with a consent on the approach of accounting, as they have already been issued before the state lawyership.
A sensation could be if the main beneficiary János decides a comprehensive agreement.
His information was less detailed, and although he had already said to report comprehensively about everything, his consent is still.
The question therefore remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have completed a package with him concerning the reimbursement of the large part of the damage of HUF 50 million, and whether it is ready to take the responsibility against it.
But it is quite possible that assignment now plays the "leading" after its search for migration of arrestation and home arrest had been pushed on doub ears.
While other criminals, who are far more damaged with economic delicates and have not forgived them, are on a free foot or at least under home arrest, this possibility remains refusing.
Psychology of the Surveillance - or why we are ready to pay more
In the case of infringements, the buyers are inclined to spend more and therefore to overvalue the boiler bid.
Neurologens and economic researchers at New York University have now managed to discover the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to beat themselves in a competition, such as a stirring on eBay, and are therefore ready to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others participated in a playback action - in both cases, the active brain regions of probands were studied by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brainrine, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the opponent's overreaching plays a key role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the 'selbst reward' of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore meant that the price increase was explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to undermine their these, the economics in the research group have also made investigations to follow the money.
In this case, three groups should provide for a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their revenue.
In addition, another group was promised to be 15 dollar rewards for the case that they come out of the game as a winner.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in case of a lost game.
The difference between two groups was therefore merely the focus on the one on gaining while the other were on loss.
However, as proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologens, the members of the "gegen the loss" group were prepared for higher revenue than those in the "winn" group.
"This results can be resulted from no previous economic theory.
These have founded the behavior observed by auctions only with the joy of gaining, or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories has been dissolved thanks to the picturesque neurological procedures, so that we have a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor looking for?
Worldwide, around half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed under the leading causes of death.
However, the number of infects is estimated to be hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that patients are often not aware of they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collapse for different virus-infectious liver diseases.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellow insult are often, but the angers and the diseases differ from one another.
The hepatitis viruses are spreading to two different types: hepatitis A and E can be transmitted by the dilution contract (e.g. by contaminated food or water), in Hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, divorce or speculation).
Travelers are recommended to be vaccinated against virus A and B anyway, against virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms at Hepatitis A show themselves about two-three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by immaculates, weaknesses, abdominal pain and Brechreiz.
Afterwards the yellow fertilizer falls on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the cure can take up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, approximately 1 million people die from Hepatitis B, much more severe diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that estimates are estimated to be only every tenth infected in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated may lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infects don't even know about their disease because the irrigator destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms are shown after 20-30 years.
Consequently, precautions, such as regular checks, are essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more frequent: those who have been subjected to transfusion in 1991, drug-dependent and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C diseases is estimated to be 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease is already evidenced in a routine laboratory examination, it is ratified to look at the home doctor in the first signs of unknown origin.
Prematurely recognized, the disease can be healed, the virus can be eradicated, banning the infection danger and preventing cancer origin.
The 30th September is the world day of Hepatitis, 2004 for the first time organised by patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen consciousness for this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their development and the importance of early recognition.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results show that religious beliefs such as a kind of "shammer" that should have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrers.
Scientists from Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It has been studied how much faith in God affects human pain, the British sheet "Telegraph".
During the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and Atheists received electric shocks, while they studied a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to disable most of the pains.
By means of a brain scan technology, even the Catholics could be able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project, which also participates in philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University.
When attempting, the probands were mounted a funny device on the left hand, which gave the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: For one of the mothers of God, gemalt by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary among the believers would create a kind of religious tendency, while they chose the image of Vinci, because it was hardly different from the other paintings and was found to be a restant.
The experimental persons spent every half an hour in a MRI scanner and received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages while they were to see either the religious or the other paintings.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "in security" in the sight of the mother of God as if they were "scared" and they had found "Rue and Peace".
While considering the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than they had seen Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the attempt, said that you could also create similar effects with other, strongly winning pictures in the atheists, you should just find the corresponding photo.
"We should find an image that triggers very positive feelings such as a mother or a father," says psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of research.
"The practice of the faith should change our personality and do it in many cases", says Wright.
According to these excellent results, only the question which effect would have a Madonna image of Leonardos or another similar painter on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high quality virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're talking about you.
During their tenth birthday, Google can say with fog and right: it is found in the pockets of people as well as their heads in heaven: she knows where people have spent their vacations, to which specialists they go, and what they move.
And so still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s directors.
In the direction of skeptics, which are plagued by Orwellschen Horrorvisions, he can explain: These would be overlooked just the essence of the Web 2.0.
In a interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about the users and thus draw closer to the original goal of the company, where they want "all information from this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of changing work, Google was still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked after the Quo status in five years, Schmidt meant: he wished that Google would be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits to me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so because they did not know enough about the users.
Not all internet users are aware that the search terms would be registered in the course of their Internet accounts, as well as the IP addresses that were searched from, and the visited sites.
For example, the "Personized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitors to store his own search and withdraw later, so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic the so-called "recommendations" which recommends the system customized products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users ask what happens in the case of a data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are worried about the Google Data Monopol.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company, which acts excitingly, and less the feeling of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the excitement of power that is refusing in many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but also passed on to third parties in the event, and in these laws there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet Usor.
A parade example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, as a result of the Google of the Brazilian government's information collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophiles.
However, in May, users who were concerned were able to oppose, when Google, together with the EFF civil rights organization, moved successfully against the FBI before court: therefore, in the future, Google can not be forced to provide information to the FBI on a secret request.
(On the other hand, the Federal Government successfully achieved the edition of 50.000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms relating to the youth protection law adopted before the year, but it has been retained the list of individual users, including their web and search terms to two months.)
Google's image remains controversial, so those who give their personal data noise because they are afraid of the loss of their private and intimacy by using the Google services, the company joins with the conservative company's conservative objection.
However, the American "Geek-Culture" presents excited fans, activists and users, the next generation of the "cold entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leaders, even if both fight for the same goal.
A possible reason for this is that Google does not request its users in contrast to Microsoft, and makes its services available for free, so that an open, continuously updated source code and program packaging seem to be far more attractive, young and cool than the official practices of the software owner.
On the other hand, the Geeks look forward to the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet messercharf - a relationship that has been focused in the centre over the past years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is not a matter of anything but of collaboration, speaking that users leave tracks and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are different, the main case remains the same to show themselves publicly.
A average younger can also manage his profile on several Community portals - by Facebook via Xanga, it can connect through other services such as Twitter, or musical services such as last.fm, and can finally connect all this into a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can produce blogs that are automatically representing the latest photo gallerys that are geostead on Flickr or Picasa.
And a series of other exampleal cases proves: When considering the party photos of the last night, the friend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has been inclined, or the staff will be released because he only makes his trouble about the management of business air in his blog - one is sure: the term "Privatsphäre" has been completely reinterpretated.
Anyone who conducts an online life is what he prices from himself - so in such a way, you could form the basic idea behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to deal with the Google Monopol, can do that - like with Scroogle, a tool that accesses the Google search engine, but no traces definitely leave.
Not a few people are not registered on Community pages, so that they are not found, but also the Google Online applications such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be transformed with alternative versions that are bound to no huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, the public opinion waits for it until Google shows its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising surfaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the ever faster imported services provide not only Microsoft, but also other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterpillar: for example, the group leader has rejected a protest of the employees after the fees of the firm child garden were doubled, the management of the multi-time petition of the employees was too costly, but it is just too mild, however, that Google was even going into the knee in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement that all regime criticisms were, or those who were violated against the good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the Group is that in advance no new service will be applied, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could be a few strongly surrounded: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scann and archive project is now taking account of the extent that the company should soon interfere with the Supreme Court, others are worried because of the "Health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the substance - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best orwellic manier a future in which a man will be kindly approaching thanks to Google.
Two youths help the double killer of \zd in the evaporation of tracks
The police have now heard two young people who are suspected to have participated in the elimination of the tracks, and the Police Commissioner Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were persisting, currently accused of the aid.
According to the news agency MTI, it is two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Support is threatened with a free sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double killing of \zd, a 23-year-old ortsan man, was taken in investigation on Sunday.
The man is under the urgency of acting suspect of being murdered from money in addition to several people.
In the course of the investigations, it has revealed that the 23-year-old had blamed a greater amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to compare his debts, so he locked his believer on a site in \zd last Wednesday, where he killed him and his nine - year - old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the deed of long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a gun hidden in the place of action.
Together with experts, the police are now examining the tattoo and the circumstances of their use.
Warsawer Börse offers purchase for Prague Börse
Approximately 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns offered the Warsaw stock exchange for the hundred percent purchase of the share packages of the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw stock exchange, confirmed the offer the Poland despite the fact that they had previously been excluded by the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchanges.
The reason is that the Warsaw stocks belong to the state.
99% of the shares is in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to declare more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
After notifications of the Czech daily newspaper "E15" the issue of Poland includes the highest purchase price which was ever offered for the Prague stock exchange.
As the newspaper reports, until now the Vienna stock exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London stock exchange and the German stock exchange have provided offers.
Petr Koblic, Chief of Prague's stock exchange, said last week that the Warsaw stocks would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not decide that this could even lead to the closing of the Prague stocks in the future.
Market experts appreciate the value of the Prague stock exchange to 5-10 billion krones.
According to the shareholders agreements, 90% of shares could be sold.
The Patria Finance Investment Bank is the largest owner of the Prague Börse, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.l with 13,5 percent.
The financial crisis from the viewpoint of European newspapers
Some leading European leaves have already spoken on Tuesday on September 11th in their ever-speaking international financial crisis.
The global financial catastrophe we have due to the U.S. President, such as "La Repubblica" - the President would not even have been able to behind his own party for the draft law, which should bring some leaning into the fearful situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the milliard-swore investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to talk about a "two 11 September".
Parts of the Press in Madrid also ordered the sin-bock in Washington.
The "El Mundo" considers the lack of political leadership that the world economy is now at the edge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the conference vote, threatens the danger that Washington has no political means for crisis management.
The world economy depends on the air, just at a time when one of the largest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
You can no longer let the threat be ignored, for example the Genfer "Tages-Displayr".
Although some countries may still provide rescue packages in their waxed money institutions and save the banks with the money of the taxpayers before the bank red.
However, if a Domino effect is triggered and there are more banks that are pleading, no further financial pipes or other immediate measures will help.
During the long term, the EU Member States should jump over their shadows and centralize control on the monetary markets.
On Monday only, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weakening money institutions, the Vienna Standard remembers. Furthermore, the newspaper continues, the concerns are more and more realistic that after the Americans, the European taxpayers should now take some deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not been seriously confronted with the crisis which is now celebrating as a Tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "retters" should not be immediately "wed" with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to maintain in what case it would be reasonable to address the taxpayer's money in order to reduce even more damage.
Smart car imitates the Hummel flight
What would the best method of developing new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example the bees.
The CEATEC in Japan presented an amazing project that inspires the Nissan-generators of Hummeln when creating new accidents.
In collaboration with the Tokyoter University, Nissan built the biomimetical system controlled by Autorobotern by type BR23C, a mini-auto equipped with the properties of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight, every bee forms its own oval "Privat area", which is very similar to our own "Schutzchild", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-PR and research development, in the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bees, which can see in every direction and in a angle of over 300 degrees, play an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, researchers recorded the idea of the laser controlled distance measuring.
This identifiers obstacles to the BR23C in an 180 degree face field within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately introduces the collision preventive process.
The obstacle is registered in seconds breaking parts, and the authoroboter immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this manoeuvre takes place instinktively.
"If it was not like, the author could not react quickly enough to deviate the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the authoroboter project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, since this technology is equivalent to the innerst and most vulnerable part of the protective shield – a layer within which accidents are still considered as unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees when they deviate other bees.
And that must run in the fracture of a second.
However, the relapse, in contrast to the bees, cannot be up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two dimensions, only in direction of the twistability of the tyres.
While the bees are infinitely open to deviate other bees, researchers could only serve the rotation movement, as well as the acceleration and abbreviation.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more energy-efficient and therefore have a longer lifetime than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and less on the ability to store it.
This device must process only a few inputs per second and respond accordingly to them.
It must not save it, or produce an intuitive, logic reaction based on former manoeuvre, so that it only uses a handful KB memory.
No gigabyte and megabyte hard memories need.
This is the first step in the development of instant collision prevention technology, which will be seriously in production within the next ten years, according to Nissan's assessment.
Another application could find the technology in the GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the driver for obstacles and lead it to the goal.
A name for the sinner child
Now, the written version of the 700-Mrd dollar presents serious rescue package, which will be applied in several stages and aims to buy the bad loans of the banks.
In the first passage, half of the money will be issued.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight in the eastern coast of the town, the congress devoted to several days of discussions have passed through a agreement on the 700 million dollars of heavy rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic President at the American parliamentary house, and said that we should only bring agreement to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both Presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister for Finance Henry Paulson said the result: the programme will show effect and it will be efficient, but it has to do more. According to Pelosi, it was not about the rescue of Wall Street, but for the purpose of raising the economy.
The written version of the package was published before opening the Asian markets, i.e. Washington's time Sunday evening 8 a.m. ( mid-European time Monday 2 p.m.), but has not triggered a high flight to the stocks.
On Monday, the House of Members first agrees on the draft law on the stabilization of the economy of 2008, then the Senate is on the series.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and also the White House welcomed the messages on the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
However, the programme departs from the original recommendation of the Bush administration that the 700 billion dollars should be issued at once for the purchase of fiber, with credits charged securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of the half of the 700 million amount should be issued, with 250 billion immediately available after the convention will be agreed on the Causa on Monday. This sum is intended to be used for the purchase of credit-loaded, bad securities, and over the next 100 billion USD should be decided by the President.
The programme is reviewed by a separate Commission, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of 700 billion depends on another decision of the convention.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactics: it can at the same time purchase bad loans, hypothecs, and purchase securities charged with hypothecs, or other "toxic" loans.
According to the competent person of the Ministry, the purchase may be carried out in both auction and directly.
The law enables the companies concerned to participate in a insurance programme, where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds, and the companies pay the appropriate fees to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as a direct assistance to the American financial system, whether it is incurred for the large purchase of poor funds, their insurance or the avoidance of a system risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We set the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it was signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks recommended in difficulties and now assigned to state aid can expect their finishings called "Golden Handshake" to be shortened by the government in the overseas Snake.
A reduction of the holders will only be available in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry is purchased in the context of an auction, the "golden handshake" is taxed unless the bank head is dismissed into the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of the faul loans, the government will take aggressively to ensure that the manager holders will not be exaggerated.
The picture also includes that existing gold handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements so that more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history that reductions are regulated by law at manager holders, commented the Democrat Barney Frank, President of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers reduces, as they can also participate as soon as it goes back to the economy and thus the saved bank again.
The draft law suggests that the President must submit a proposal to the convention in the next five years, how the taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, on both sides there were creators who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect the money of the taxpayers, says the Californ Republic of Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said that the measures were advanced by the same persons who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

No more visa in the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the US-Hungary Visa Agreement around the 12th Years, as the Foreign Minister explained before the representatives of the Hungarian municipality in Chicago.
"I think that the electronic immigration and control system, as well as the control system, is now being introduced in Oversee."
It also stressed that the new system will not give permission, but the tourists should have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is being negotiated today in Washington.
She meets the Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleezza Rice, who is transferred to the "Mediterrane Verdienstkreuz with Stars" of the Republic of Hungary, and also speaks with the foreign-political consultants of the Barrack Obama Democrats and the Republikan Presidentship candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the two Presidential candidates of the major American parties, have provided their support for the 700 billion dollar rescue package for banks. However, there are also politicians who demand the return of the financial minister.
The government's congress and representatives have announced on Sunday morning after day marathon consultations that they have come to an agreement on the banking payment package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the view of the frozen credit market, were on the central issues of the Presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand his presidency with the economic themes, while McCains High, which has ordered him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convent, at the same time.
At a election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will quickly accept the law of the 700 billion dollar package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he supported.
"We have to act now, and although responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industry branches, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened" - he said 35.000 viewers.
He has not failed to mention McCains economic views as "obsolated".
In an interview given to the sender ABC, McCain explained: "We will all have difficult to kieper (...) but not at all is no alternative."
The republican senator said that the plan also presents a control Commission for the Minister of Finance as well as the restriction of the finishings for the Top Manager - something that he has existed.
The CBS said Obama that McCain had not played a final role in negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, informed that the House of Members will probably already vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press view of the German room
The right camp is intact, one of the choosers were more self-conscious within the camp - so commented "The mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria Haider and Co are ready to rule in order to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-hand news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayerns Revolution ruins their fathers".
According to the renowned police, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over its offices.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria over decades - now the modern citizens turn away from them.
The breakdown of epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy as well as Angela Merkel.
The desaster of the CSU did not come surprisingly, but on Sunday something went to the end, which has been quite precisely ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of a government party
For ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and falled under the Fifty-procent brand for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago with the warriors in 2005, i.e. in the many-cited Stoiber-Era.
The modernization operated by the CSU in the federal country has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had prognosed this 40 years ago, but they were significantly estimated in the pace, but without the consequences of secularisation, the success of education, the growth of East and North Germans in the prospering regions of Bayern could not remain on the faithfulness of the CSU choosers.
Modernisation is always going together with optional increase, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the choosers inside the camp have become more critical and self-willing.
It is noteworthy that in recent weeks the classic civil groups expressed the largest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and electoral with abitur such as a degree of higher education.
The support of the CSU was reduced to even less than 40 percent.
The Press (depresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna daily newspaper reports in her "Where with whom? Party Chiefs Retaining in Coalition Questions" entitled article on chaotic domestic policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions for conversations, while the Greens do not want to set themselves on coalition yet.
The new elections are over, and now all around the coalition; in the debates in public-law television, the leaders had hardly looked into their cards.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some states and in social partnership is already the case.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP-Chef as a Vice Chancellor, opened Faymann.
As he said, the electors would have picked off the Schüssel-Molterer curse.
A repetition of this direction is not in question.
But Molterer has reacted carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said when Faymann tries to interfere in internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether its party is in opposition or in the coalition is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed by ÖVPintern.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider showed itself open in all directions.
"To prevent red black, we are ready to take government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken through
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on equal opportunities, which is now being directed by the President-in-Office of the European Council of France.
In its speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz-Deputy of the European People's Party, particularly attention to the educational egregulation, as it is one of the most serious legal infringements, the Roma children contradict, and this is the greatest obstacle to their validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and civil society in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka noted the press office of the Fidesz EP, noted that, in addition to discrimination in the job search, Roma was primarily enduring from the labour market because of its low level of education.
"The predominant majority of the Roma youths have no medium-sized education, and thanks to a poor basic school education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right that is a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investments in the early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
The Members believe that these relationships will be conscious of the broadest possible circle - namely Roma and non-Roma.
For ever before, a Roma student starts school, so that it increases its opportunities to become a productive member of the labour market; and through income and sales tax they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the bad and segregated education must be set up" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the Members stated that a common, target and negotiation-oriented approach is necessary to accelerate the desegration process in the education sector, in this respect the correct compliance of the existing and planned anti-discriminatory directives.
"We need to break through the devil circle from poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full-righted citizens," Járóka called.
Since the last year, the Summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the preparation of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national level in the sense of the "European Year of Equality".
CSU: Grace at Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the voting deck, no heads were rolled at the top of the Bavarian CSU.
Party Chief Erwin Huber and Minister President Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace chooses.
About the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-procent voting loss is decided on the last October week on the extraordinary party day.
However, the much scold duo already made it look through that it does not want to dress on her chairs.
In this way, they want to contemplate the intimidated group and the basis of the party who demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bayerian Tsunami" due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admitted under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber’s career height - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. However, a year after the pope against Stoiber they could only guarantee 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, CSU was "Alleinregier" in Bayern, which was 18 percent of the German GDP.
Although conservatives remain the determining force in which the Hungarian economy will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the intermediate restructurings, the potential successor Hubers, Vice President and Federal Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team which leads to the liberal FDP, and the legally distributed "Free Wähler" talks about a possible Münchner coalition.
One ionion of the fate is similar to that of the list "Free Wähler" that Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature, whose anti-Stoibians occur in the Huber-Beckstein Duo first used to serve the targeted politician gnadenlessly.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who moved the feathers out of the background, becomes an active role. The former President and President of the President of the Minister of Ministers called the 'bitter day of his political course' on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic comments towards CDU - his opinion that CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the location as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If CSU, who has contributed much to success in 2005 at national level, cannot be put back on the legs with a common act of power, Merkel will not be able to re-establish after the wardrobe in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a heat from their disappointment over the Fiasko, believes that the CSU terrain loss will not be negatively affected by the large coalition in Berlin.
What is relatively, however, the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the social democrats continues, however.
With 18,6 percent the SPD has reached its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukechenko Opposition: 110-0
There was no opposition to the Ukrainian Parliament in the elections on Sunday.
Russian observers believe that this is the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD believes that the laws of votes are counting.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-owned Member State has been without opposition since decades. Nevertheless, the counterparty gathered under the name "Common Democracy Forces" (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukechenko, who had been a member of the unclear elections and, thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time, would leave a number of Members of the opposition in Parliament.
Therefore, the ODS even took away from the Boykottes planned before.
The Ukraine will be more and more economically dependent because of the increase in the prices of the gas import of Russia. For the borrowing of price increases, the country has also agreed to the Russians, and the country has also agreed to annulment of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country. In the background of the opposition's expectations, Ukraine was to improve their relationship with the EU after Lukechenko and other high-level politicians have been banned as an antidemocratic political system in the EU.
For a temporary relaxation, the evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which the focus was rather on positive movements rather than the lacks - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticized the campaign - that is why oppositional should not occur in the press - and in particular the fact that opposition was not allowed to be present in the counterfeiting of votes.
In spite of all this, opposition can recognise a improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set on a free foot, and Minsk is even too smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to accept the independence of the abrupt Georgian provinces of South East and Abchasien, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federative state, has been regarded as independent since one month.
"We have made two steps forward and a back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our sheet.
According to the opposition candidates of the 2006 Presidency elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the mighty fear has received to leave only an oppositional to Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results but is trying to clarify the need for a economic reform to choosers.
"We have a lot of problems here to fight - the oppositional newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us into the way when selling stones, but I see that more people support the change, even the older" - Milinkewitsch said in an indication that not even the most supported layer of pensionists is agreed with the Lukechenko regime, whose only service is the production of social security.
"Thanks the debt of the country and the increase in trade deficits, it is just a question of time to breach the silence of a cemetery of social security," says Milinkewitsch.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democraticly.
Sergej Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community Independent States, stated the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the deeds, and not the words". Therefore the lack of opposition is an evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now the work gets fun"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are spinable doors for the in- and outgoing of officials.
From today on, the measure will enter into force against those clausees, which will only postpone and then go to coffee drink during the working period.
The new "Anti Faulpelz-Gesetz" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council's Bureau.
">" turnable doors are a means to increase working efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services," says Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," underlines Brunetta again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the installation ends in all the constructions of the Board of Ministers.
Masi meant: "The choice of the spinable doors is also of great symbolic value."
The Secretary-General assured that this process was supported by all those who came from all sides.
So all in all there is no breakfast during the working time; close with caffee or croissant .
Brunettas advises a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 a.m. works wonder."
During a meeting of the Public Administration Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrizionone)
From Rome, the Minister stated that "in three months the absences of officials have reduced to 50%, i.e. 600,000 people per year are more at work".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"The wage dynamics - so the minister - were twice the size of the private area in the last 8-10 years and far above the rate of inflation."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined to counteract the Brunetta decree under the profession supported by Codacons.
"When the Minister for Public Service is profiled by figures about lower absorptions at work - so the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active filament' grow unbroken.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have come together to explain the conflicting standards of the Decree."
In particular, before the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) for additional financial compensation for work-related diseases, the planned extension of the mandatory home arrest of the sick workers will be combated, while the control visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's renewals are challenged.
Napolitano: Prevent against work accidents is crucial
Every day, 2500 labour accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain in a lifelong invalid.
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail (Isstituto nazional contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the deadly work accidents were approximately 1200.
These figures indicate the seriousness of a phenomenon, which almost doublely causes deaths as caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazional Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will take the 58th national day for the victims of labour accidents in all provinces of Italy, in order to draw attention to this dramatic situation of social institutions and media.
"The worrying, distributed data and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention is at work.", the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione national mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "great appreciation for the constant commitment to preventing jobs, protecting the injured workers, support for the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"An embarrassed "Basta" has risen to this; understandable in Tragödies that, measured in their size order, trigger some in the media and participation of the public. However, the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "it is also a resource problem at all: it must be invested crucially in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in the school framework of young people who feed themselves in the working world are particularly important.
It is our duty to focus on this phenomenon and not rely on its social seriousness.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "speaking the phenomenon of work related deaths a urgent social emergency, which imposes the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules which have the aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data of labour accidents seem to signal a simple improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of labour-related deaths is much too high," stressed President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. Just that's the result of tragedy at the end."
"How do you believe that you are doing too little in order to counteract the phenomenon of accidents.
We believe that more intensive controls and inspections are necessary – Mercandelli, but also more measures to clarify the workers who are already starting in school".
"A further effort is necessary - so it adds - the communication and awareness of public opinion.
But, above all, a greater responsibility is required by the employers' sides of an phenomenon that represents social emergency."
Mercandelli was also referring to "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the victims of labour accidents" and preferred the "determination of the social system against which we are fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the employer a guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the victim of a work accident is not dependent on voluntary or random donations decided by a lawdoer from time to time."
Mp3-Player under accusation: risk of hearing damage
Speaking music about a longer period of time with portable musical devices, such as Mp3-Player, may lead to permanent hearing damages.
This is the European Commission, which, in a report published in Brussels today, quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Science Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report – so it says in a note – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who are listening to music with tragable music instruments for at least five years of week, risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I'm worried that a so large number of young people who normally put tragable musical devices and mobiles on a high volume to damage their hearing without knowing it inevitably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – so it is from the Eu – reveal a clear risk that encourages rapid action.
What really is it is to make consumers sensitivity and make this information about common goods.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the existing control systems again so that they can be fully effective and keep a step forward with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of tragable musical equipment among young people.
"The scientists - so close the EU communication - confirm that they are too concerned and that the European Commission will now examine the necessary measures to protect children and young people better from the sound that comes from portable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard, which limits the level of the noise of tragable musical devices to 100 dB, the concern about the damages that could come from a large noise burden.
You can limit these damages very much, in which to take solutions such as reducing the volume and length of the noise suspension.
In her report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union notes that if users of tragable musical instruments only listen to five hours the week (such as 89 decibel) music so that the legal limits of the workplace have already been exceeded with regard to the maximum noise level.
Those who exceed this limit are risking the complete loss of the hearing within five years.
So this affects 5-10% of the users of such devices whose number can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno gives the initial committee on the Commission's future of the capital
We start today, in March it's supposed to be over, in June, balance is drawn.
This is the stage set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome. The Commission has taken itself in the new seat of the Caracalla themes this morning.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project will be completed, the City and the Council will evaluate the analysis and projects to be able to imagine the strategic plan for Rome with the "official Stempel" of the Capitol and the mayor of Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all the political, social and cultural opinions are represented in her," said Alemanno. "She will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains in the city and in the municipality.
There is no new distribution of powers, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will re-resolve, as such a project has to have a certain endpoint.
In June - so stated by the mayor - we will imagine the strategic plan in which we will use the work carried out by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence as their opinion lacks liability, which Alemanno replies: "All things depend on the work that the Commission will pay and depend on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often the policy is concerned with the daily problems and emergencys that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want a longer period of view to work seriously in the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The headquarters of Rome put great value to explain the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens, and it will make us think of it. It will cover the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, it is necessary to possess a strategic plan that is neither hermetically nor static to enable our city a tribute of quality - which it really needs - to do so a common step in the future."
A future, according to Rome's upper bourgeois, which will "not only be limited to the current local borders but much further," not only as regards the role of Rome as metropole and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president?
A well-known American politician who is much in view of being regarded as independent wrote: "Barack Obama is the second anti-american president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the United States economy and maintained relations with the entrenched Islam (and this is still a private man today).
The attacks against Obama become ever stronger, just now, where the elections approach.
A Miami lady wrote in a web page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very freak: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation who has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
However, in fact, these attacks do not have much to say; it is racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the surveys; all say that Obama will win with a great spring.
Also in this case, people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the deepmost south of the United States, wrote in her editorial: only in the election cabin, we will well know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States to the presuppose that has been hidden up to the last.
"Tell what you want, then we will decide for who we will make our crickets, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will go out of America.
Something you never heard before – just now, where the success of the black candidate seems so sure.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error was Bush committed during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America changes.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a step into the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, the Iraq remains for the majority of the weakness of Bush.
The one who will take his body stands on a huge task.
U.S. The financial collapse also leaves its traces with journalists: in newspapers you can feel the reductions. And many are accusing the Internet, the "morther" of the pressure press.
Five hundred American journalists were consulted by the PEW Research Center on their situation and mental control over the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not really explain about the information relating to those concerned because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for the American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists of a economic model that was destroyed.
In addition, the major problems come through the reductions to the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work in order to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that must be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, not significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism today meets the American journalist.
Six of ten journalists and Executive Senioren of the pressure press are of the opinion that journalism is in the wrong way at national level.
In the local area there are even 65% in exporters.
Printed for Broadcast.
It is not difficult for the journalists to introduce in what direction the web goes.
The most important publishing groups are the way to the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "killer" of the pressure press.
The 'economic pressure' that the journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to join the new technology in the hope of "they bring something good for journalism".
The largest rising is today in the American journalism between the heads of the newsroom and the reporters working for them.
56% of the national editors are sure that their reporters share their values with them while it is only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with the "security in work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years shall be 47% at national level.
The journalists have 30%.
The topic of safe work in the team (unsere "Redacture", Anm.d Red.) is always a current topic in the United States.
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as it is the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV operators, the employers like they are popular and so it will be a question of taking it or leave it.
The head editors often get very high wages, however, the editor can at present only get 10000 euros per month, with pension and insurance money.
As regards vacation, the matter will be complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third to reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they give themselves, will often "krank" over the year.
It's a question of climate.
UNIPOL: JUSTING IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTABERRATA
The President of the Second Board of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the application of the real estate maker, which had been asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the counter agreement in the case of acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the arrest was converted to a residence obligation to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate maker to be moved from the province city to a apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such tensions (when the prosecutor had expressed) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and address proof to him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Members agreed against the 700 billion dollar par package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing the Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the stringual edition of the New York Times, which reports the crisis in the course of the Republikan Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast-Seele, which always favoured the state institutions and the business community, and the neo-conservative, "the in Washington" and the financial world hostilely faces and wins for example in the south and the centre of the States electors.
This part of the party owes its rise to the vote of which I mentioned above.
This example, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announced or even already present: not only in the United States, also in the West and perhaps in the fare of these will be affected.
In both the States and Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerated by the long anxiety events, which, under these new conditions, finally accept and come to light.
The first of these phenomenons is the new discovery, the inevitable Renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a deterioration of the banking and financial institutions, which have close links to abroad, and also manages an unhappy amount of the assets of private households living in a single country.
This means a direct political problem for the governments, namely as it applies to the families concerned, which also represents a huge electoral mass.
The crisis, therefore, appears global, politically, on the other hand, is almost purely national.
Political Internationalism seems to be in a way independent and lost its right to speak: the EU has been given an insulting evidence for this, which, due to its two-party, cannot find a common way in various national and international conflicts.
Therefore, all of them are now expecting the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, for example, distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more serious, only the United States will be able to rescue without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use these: two non-equivalent conditions – under certain circumstances – on which otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to fall back in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state national element is perfectly consistent with the ever greater importance which is recently associated with a most closely related sector in the economy: territorial.
Paradox's way is now when we were so convinced that we have long entered into a networked total, into a rich of the ever differentised technologies, the immater, that we have to find out at once how our future will be increasingly depending on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although these can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are connected to a closely surrounded piece of earth – a territorium.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in an unreasonable, waterless or free area of oil.
I am now coming to the second news, but it requires a short breakdown.
Whoever Territorium, who government, who says politics, says this also leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomenon.
On the one hand, the knowledge of the need for respected leaderships is the need for someone who knows how to control things.
On the other hand, there is a wave of relaxation about the existing leaders, for example those of the economy, which have been disappointed as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
In addition, a deeply rich and in a sense still disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an innocence, an image of inefficientness, a feeling of distance, which is all directed to a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems to be such a way of conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the deeds of social elites but already its ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is more and more foreign than ever.
The demand for leadership therefore feeds a branched but powerful movement of the kidnapping of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This is revealed in unforeseen "revolts" of the electors and in the unprecedented reversal of the collective cohesion of the last time: starting with the rise in the conservatives in Austria and Bayern, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, towards the rebellion of the American Members against Bush (and perhaps also play a role of the victors in Italy).
One gains the impression that the old Elite, her parties, her programs, but also her rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some of them would say their format, more understanding problems, and therefore less representative value regarding what is happening today in the lower social levels of the West and from the financial crisis is still increased and driven to overdiversity.
In view of all of this, it would be simply overdreven to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes far open, however, isn't it.
The Supercloth that leaves up to walls
The forces of heavy force to be defeated by a clever and to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four U.S. research centres, from which one seems to have almost reached the goal now.
With a clever produced on a surface of only 2.5 qcm, researchers managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – a American magazine, has published the results of the researchers at Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the research team is a further development of the already used clefics, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nutritional tubes.
"The principle of the clever can be imagined like a series of stacks of Spaghetti-ordered tubes," says Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have inspired themselves from the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopic hardens that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass Teflon and screw papers have shown that the new clever is ten times stronger than the holdability of the feet of the reptiles and also "disposeless from the wall," says Liming Dai, researchers of the Faculty of Engineering Sciences at Dayton University.
AN MAUERN ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a transitional clef,' adds Liming Dai.
Like Spiderman emporing walls? Maybe already, but the researchers think of a less fascinating advantage, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanor tubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other application areas may fall in the area of space.
So for the moment the Superhelds have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF THE FORSCHING – as well as the University of Berkeley, California, devote itself to a new clever type.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, the kalifornian scientists present a micro fiber that cleanses themselves from the dust by movement on a surface and thus always maintains perfect liability.
Medicines: Never take with fruit juice
Care for gripfruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitaminism v.a. in summer, may cause serious health damage if they are taken together with certain vital medicines, as they can influence them in an extreme way through the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly pointed to the risk of more packed and fresh fruit plants related to medicines. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again reminded: It is sufficient for a glass of apple, orange or gripfruit juice to reduce the capability of certain vital medicines so far as to eliminate these practically and thus risk the health of patients.
Grapefruitsaft has already been suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiac medicines, anxiolytic and neurological agents to toxic levels.
MEDIKAMENTS IN GEFAHR – Diesel Agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients two years ago before the dangers of this mix, and stressed how to drink in connection with means such as Diazepan or Metadon.
ES IS NOT GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, Orangensaft and applesaft substances that can impose the medicines.
The list of active substances in the fruit seeds is long.
Therefore, the Appell of Michele Carruba, the Director of the Università Statale di Milano, said: "These results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there are any unclearities, not to have a pharmacist or physician to ask," stressed the expert of the ansa organisation.
Economic nobel price goes to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is to the American Paul Krugman for its analysis of trade patterns and the attraction of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the Bush-administration economic and excise policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of enron collapse, Krugman claimed in a leading article of the New York Times that this second event was more crucial for the history of the United States than the attractions.
A prediction that has not received little politics as an answer to the economist was still prematured for years later but today proves to be quite correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked about how quickly the memory of the scandals disappeared from the public field in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom," said Krugman in 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "econom of great value", but also a banalian with a "tough aggressive style, which is particularly opposed to the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software wins an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both under the volunteers and in the public administration.
After a year of intense work by the voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents the audience with some new things: next to a revised and now spartanic-made start menu, is now finally one of the reasons for guaranteed compatibility with Apples OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Attention was also against compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting also are some new features, such as those who allow it to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which, for example, facilitate sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files in graphic editing modules and maintaining the original appearance of the page.
So you can also generate "hybride" PDF files which extend the typical graphics of Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: Tables can now be processed by different users, avoiding conflicts in changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor will be assigned a frab to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently trying to publish different functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result is to be made public.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html. It follows the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
For Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can send the installation CD to home or to the office.
However, the freedom of costs can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, so it is also in the field of business where OpenOffice could succeed in the great worf: finally several public administration institutions and schools have already passed to OpenOffice.
In fact, it does not even lack a training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business views.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program aimed at enduring Excel; Impress, creating presentations like Powerpoint; Dbase for the operation of databases instead of known access; and, last, draw an graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand now.
Coal also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens a new doping case mi frame of the past tour de France: it is the Austrian sporter Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is a third-classified and tricot winner of the best climber.
The message published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on their website.
The 26-year-old coal of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver who was tested positively on Cera, the Epo of the third generation. Before that, this was already met with the Italian Riccò and Leonardo Piepolis and the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis of the blood samples coal is among those who have been performed in the last weeks by Lasanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and be excluded for two years from the races.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, notified the Austrian competencies.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the tricot of the best climber for themselves.
THEMA INWORKING: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRAGT: IST ITALIA RASSISTISCH?
Italy, "the single country of emigrates has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only taken with objections.
Does this make a nation of racists from Belpaese? This asks the New York Times in a long article devoted to the whole issue of racism in Italy and from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was murdered in Milan after he had complained a packaging of Kekse.
The case proves of what the Times referred to as "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and working opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of Lega North".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls on further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not only this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster interpretation of illegal immigrants is also introduced as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement, which also underlined the Pope and President of the State, "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between church and state to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students does not know crisiss.
According to the last study of Sunia, the rental company, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Neapel and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already adopted very serious trains. All students' crowds lose their right to study as often as their families are unable to support them in this height" – according to Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities the great demand of students leads to a deformation of the market that also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most of the rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, no rent price limit, unauthorised property.
For Sunia there is the need for exceptional measures which lead to lower rental prices through a revision of taxes.
In more detail, the study reveals that in Milan a sleeping area is needed in the quarter of Brianza about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the quarter of the bands of Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the quarter of Vittoria.
In Florence a sleeping area costs an average of 350/400 Euro, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the quarters around the University, 250/280 euros are for a place of needles, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices in the quarters around the Uni are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double room in a double room.
Only little deeper are the rentals in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Eastern and Cinecittà.
Only those who are in a foreign area can save money: 300 euros for a bedroom and 450 euro for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, Policlinico, Vanero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a bedroom costs 250-350 Euro, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities the prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of rent to non-European students, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent over 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Receivable to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historical cinemas
The historical cinema closes due to the beneficiary multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinema is a blind city like a face without eyes."
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes what is currently happening in the large city centres of Italy, as well as in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinema, which started with the birth of the large multisaal complex in the periphery, means long-term death for the single-cino in the centre. A process that does not only appear indecisive and unrepentantly, but also wear the trains of a cultural crime.
Most of the historical places have been affected, "it is like a friend to lose a piece of street full of emotion," said the director of the movie "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great price of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the history of a predatorkinos and its nostalgy, which consists of living in a well lost cinema world.
The figures that the Anec, the central trade union, delivers, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the unhappy amount of 316 traditional cinemas has to be closed; the cinemas were mainly paid in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinema, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and the lobbardei with 41.
This proves that the main guilts are the multiplexkinos, because there are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardei represents the lists, 81 are both in the Tuscany and in the Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also result, but in the first place, the preservation of the existing one, for closing a hall in the city, are not all its tribal customers ready to visit instead of the old a multiplexkino in the periphery.
And there is still the lack of floor for the found of the trade union, except: the debt charge recorded by the State is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is a shame of the ethical-moral view that the government does not notice the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be required in the year".
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided because of the fears of the old cinemas to protect and protect them by a agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinema, and in both the historical centre and in the periphery.
Under the preliminary measures, tax benefits for the cinema drivers and the benefits for the public in relation to the intermediary are also allowed to go to the centre-limited areas and also to more favourable parking fees.
"It is an exciting initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
But we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to focus something against the super power of multiplex halls, because, finally, the audience is more demanding today.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the challenging point that brought me to establish the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even if I had played with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I live in Rome; when I pass over to the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to not have to see the dust-coated posters.
The links between politics and Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the Mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the advocate of the Antimafia members of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning because of the development of Mafia businesses.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the Clan and the public administration, and its nephew: the lawyer, which is the same name as the clans's boss, was already sentenced to 10 million euros for the development of criminal associations of Mafia at that time.
"Every sort of moral and legal norm misachting," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advice activities."
"The Mafia group was thus made it possible – thus the Judges – to impose officially into the council houses and to agree to the public administration policy."
The President of the Kalabria Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not emphasize that in its region it is "all other than an exception to interfere with connections of local administrations and organised crimes." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others where such links are practically unavoidable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta: heroes who receive a white west."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police of the Clan Piromalli, was defense.
Since the end of the last April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council has been dissolved, but in 1991 – and also due to the supposed links between organized crimes and local administration – the local politicians of their municipal officials had been exhibited.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, has been elected to the head of the middle-right coalition after the Stichwahl from May 2006.
He shouted Scandal when the prefecture ordered the resolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in the Minister of Vice-President Marco Minniti, who considered him to have found everything for politically-strategic reasons, but the judge explains in connection with the warrant command of this morning that the Piromalli clan had even been waiting for a change in the A3 project.
A hearing on the case of Dal Torrione’s studies has shown the willingness to meet the desires of an entrepreneur, which is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus the public administration’s actions were identical with the interests of this clan."
When the energy escapes from the waves, the Great suddenly runs up
It is an unsatisfactory source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface, and now it seems to understand the great energy companies in the world.
Wells, currents and times are the new renewable energy sources that are looking at, and also looking for ocupers, such as chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from sea movements has been considered and studied for 70 years; these studies have not randomly increased significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the oil price in 1980 incurred the idea of marine energy, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are invented to new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This is equal to the double of the energy produced by nuclear power plants currently.
In addition, the currents and timings are still being found.
Gigants at attack.
The first company that now puts on maritime energy is Enersis, which signed a contract to establish a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are more and more companies from the traditional energy industry, which are based on the marine energy gain.
"Chevron examines these technologies" – the speaker of a US-American greeter-known company in the Wall Street Journal – and considers how to work together with us."
It is about the award of the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project on the coast of Alaskas.
This is a not too underestimating sign, for example, if one considers that the United States' oils continue to be promoted in Alaska and President Bush has recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. companies from New York and Ocean Power are also known to invest in the new industry; the details are also not known, but observers speak of increasing interest.
Also improved technologies.
Experts speak of a technology still in the breakdown, this is not last because the last doubts are not yet cleared by the sides of the environmental protection.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are rather smaller and seem to cause no serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy in a large scale, technologies with much greater impact on the environment need.
There are different ways: Ocean Power uses approximately a system of bundles connected.
The shoe of the waves, which move the bumps up and down, is converted within the swims over pigs and cylinders to hydraulic pressure.
This drives a turbine, which turns a generator.
The current is sent through underwater pipes to the coast.
Until now there are four planned plants of this kind, which are only waiting for State approval. A part of the energy gained could also serve for military institutions.
In fact, Verdant Power already produces energy for a warehouse and a park set with the help of under-sea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the periods drive the turbines, which spray the generator through the crew movement.
According to Verdant, a long snake of possible clients already waits for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tastes.
According to the Institute for Energy Research, a particular interest is the potential that is in the periods of time.
Even though it is an irregular phenomenon, the moments are more predictable than wind flows, sun radiation and waves, and therefore a more reliable electricity source.
The current energy is what states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states have already contributed to investing 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – for 2009 up to 35 million are already planned.
