Triumph of the law populists in Austria, totally 29 percent come
A deficiency of both parties of the large coalition and a significant strengthening of the legal populist parties led to the first provisional results of the parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
Especially lost the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the former president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the kippe.
On the other hand, the election leader of the association for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeschef Jörg Haider, for a triumphal return to the Federal Policy.
According to the previous results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains at 29.8 percent of the votes strongest in the country, compared to the last elections in 2006, but it loses 5.5% of the votes.
Even worse, the ÖVP, which loses nearly nine percent of the voices by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian after-war history, and especially in the People's Party who had requested the elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP came out of the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead before the SPÖ.
However, the voters probably punished the party for the failure of the government.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about a possible withdrawal of the party chairman and Vizekanzler Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party Board.
Such a development would probably evaporate the way to the most likely way out of the voting bakel, i.e. a renewal of the large coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both legal populist parties - the liberties (FPÖ) were provisionally 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - but at the same time the social democracy expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party talks with the populists (the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 she was distributed by the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even led to sanctions by the European Union.
It is clear that Jörg Haider, who already explained that he was ready to work with each party and go out from return to Vienna to the Austrian Federal Policy.
In addition, to Parliament, the Party of the Greens, which suffered light losses and disrupted from the third to the fifth place under the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-procentürdes, and therefore did not go into Parliament.
Blackenberg: Relations with India can cool themselves
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been accused in India because of the unlawful collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be a certain cooling of the Czech-indian relations.
This highlighted the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian office colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, then it comes to a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the discussions, in judiciary matters, the exercise could only be difficult to take effect.
In spite of all, he suggested that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released by the claim and received a penalty that would have central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case falls.
"His problem could be clarified," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of liberty, it would be the best of Mukherdshi's view if he was going to occupation in a higher instance.
He could ask for release for cheating and waiting for his judgment in freedom, says the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partners had justified themselves in the case of negotiations.
"He recommends a profession in a higher court, then a question for him," said the Chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene is to give the judged 'competent legal support', the Indian minister led to.
At the same time, he said that such help is already commanded by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that too", said Blackenberg.
At the same time, the Czech press agency ČTK, reaffirmed the Czech Republic's issue of Czech enomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
One answer to the question whether he had received the commitment to discuss the matter, the Minister is out of the question.
"I was already quite promised," he just observed.
A Czech over ringing around the seaside
It enters an electronic map on which Australia and the sea zones are decorated.
However, he does not interested in the continent but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with her as well as the adjacent sealand.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said the Italian jurisdiction Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-knowledged team of the UN Convention for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His head, the Division Director, the Czech jurisdiction Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and supplements it.
Here work elan and enthusiasm.
The marine ground is still a very little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here it is possible to find oil, the more excavation and other non-adulting raw materials, but also the unprecedented living organisms, which, for example, lead to the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A marine ground greater than the mainland
Today, the countries of the Anrains reported their right to the new sea areas.
After an UN Convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay on Jamaica.
This is the most important area of the continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers away from the bank of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has a exclusive claim to all sources of continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly expressed, as a continental shelf, the part of the sea floor and its soles representing a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the limits of the Ufer Sea, often also the limit of two hundred sea miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the Commission's country to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be based on a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation work.
"One of our tasks is to give the Commission legal and professional technical support.
The Commission has negotiated more than five applications, by Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the three last countries have been successful," adds Mikulka.
On an international echo, the success of Australia was recently, which, as the first country, could significantly increase its marine areas.
But also New Zealand is a winner - the extension of the sea floor, which has been approved last week by the Commission, is approximately 1.6 million square kilometers, so about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that arises from the use of the sea floor in the future will have an indifferent value as they promise.
Other countries will progressively submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment when they ratify the "Convention of Montego Bay".
There, where the continental Schelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins called by the Convention as a "common heritage of mankind".
There's no state any more specialization here.
The right to promote in this area provides an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor is not a gold-gold land", says a little overthrowing director Mikulka and adds, whose "a single areas are legally defined and the system is contractually assembled."
Czech Republic
A part of the sea floor today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares him with other states of the former Eastblock within the common organization of "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, due to the convention, as well as the investors of some less more states, they received the status of a so-called "bahnbreaking investors".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific between Mexico, Hawai and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is a little greater than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it's a kind of tatra on the sea ground.
"Fearers can be found in an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich place of polymetal concretions that contain nickel, copper, cobalt and Mangan", says another jurisdiction, Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The mazedonic staff of the Rober Sandev Division brings such concretion as a pattern.
She remembers a little potato or, with some fantasy, the glorious shelter who raised the legend after the golem to life.
German special forces were locally freed at Geisel
The Egyptian government had called for help from Germany to solve the Geislkrise - the experts came.
When it became serious, special units were ready, but they did not.
For the circumstances of liberation 11 European tourists distributed in Egypt, more and more details are known.
German special forces were also involved in the rescue operation, according to the defense and interior Ministry.
Accordingly, both Federal Warfare Specialists and Officers of the GSG 9 were the flying army of the Federal Police, the Bundeskriminalamt and logistics experts of the technical assistance work in the place of liberation.
However, as Ministers told on Monday evening, German forces were not needed because the prisoners had run their prisoners and fled when they recognized signs for a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to join them locally as support forces.
"Happyly it hasn't come," said a speaker of the Federal Ministry of Finance.
Angreifers had defeated the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, a rumenin and their eight Egyptian companions on 19 September in the south of Egypt.
After the destruction in a wilderness area in southern Egypt, the hostels in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and the Chad were slapped and slipped down.
The identity of the hosts remained unclear as well as the details of liberation or possible solvent payments.
In the meantime, the coats have arrived well-haved in Kairo.
He said that the liberated hosts start in the obhut of the German Embassy.
He did not express himself to the details of the release.
At first there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to "Image" timeling, the five holidays and special forces are to be fled out with an air bus of the air weapon and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representativeshaus refuses rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. congress has made the $7,7 billion of heavy rescue package for the financial markets very little failure.
The Dow Jones went out into the depth.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. representative house rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the calls by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme that should be imposed on the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the advocates had desperately tried to convince the critics still of the $7,7 billion heavy package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiative leaders, had called the Members for an agreement even if the plan was unpopulary.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet entered," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke by more than six percent or by 600 points.
Reasoning concerns were the investors who could fail the state rescue package.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after the mistake, to crash.
Experts are now expecting further serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
The consent of both of the Parliament and of the Senate is necessary for the entry into force of the programme.
Organizers are rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel organisers:
In the case of travel bookings for the next months, the sales rate in comparison to the previous year has risen significantly in a study - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic views, the German travellust remains untrusted by a study.
In bookings for the winter season, travel offices recorded a sales rate of 31 percent compared to the previous period, as the German Travel Association (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation of the GfK Market Research Institute, booking numbers are already increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the revenue rate of the travel offices for October has been around 11 percent compared with 2007, the DRV informed.
The basis for these results are figures of the GfK, evaluating monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and high for the total market.
The travel bookings took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar course, the DRV had been asked in particular to travel to the United States.
Here the booking growth was around one third.
Spain, Turkey and Greece, and the homeish filths in the Germans, were particularly asked travel goals.
In particular, pause trips were high in the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of increasing costs for energy and food, the costs "for customers are better calculable than for individually organized holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, by early bookersrabatte or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked so that, compared to the previous year, the number of Germans, which took a trip, will have been remarked as a sales rate, although, according to a further study, it was reduced in comparison to the previous year.
My first time October Festival
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless sleeve, beer from Liter-Krügen and Promis in designer-Dirindln.
A messenger debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much common.
It is blonde, television moderator and wears a customized Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: almost three minutes on the grass, the photographers already stir up on us and cut the memory cards full - very dirty and that at my first grass visit.
That's what you're doing to make friends.
The Billig-Dirindl seems to fulfil its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the white worst-equator, well-being was still limited.
But it was just a time to get in therein, it's half so bad.
Almost every one wears Dirndl or leather hoss; no one looks scared or embarrassed - everything quite normal.
Rare views at the Schokobanan stand only reap my dirt scarf.
A Municher reminds me that I had incorrectly bound the bark: "Left hoast free, mid-Jungu, right-forgiving, behind whiteness."
I'm still freezing the loop from the back to the left.
"Passt," it said and laughed.
Others make less effort for subtile flirt techniques and wear slight fibres, on which "To drunk to get clothed!" stands and attracts an unbited look against the naked back part.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitüden is Bob, comes from England and also visited the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a long-drawn "oooo".
He tells me that after he was disappointed by his pre-drinking measure.
Right next to one of those hydrodrants, all think he's a trash.
So Bob is one of these royal "Wildbieslers".
Others do not have luck to get out of alcohol in this way.
By eight o'clock in the evening, sanitarys are running in Scharen over the fortress that must care for the poor slanders.
The nurses always get up in the Rudel - always four at once sleeves a thoughtd traged from tent to tent.
This works as with most artists: empty down, completely back.
You don't see who is under the plane in the Promille-Sarg.
"This are those where the goarn is packing," one of the sanitants called me on request and disappeared in the genus.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after she was driven by a vehicle in Essex was known.
Carole Paulson, living in Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the centre of the city.
She was brought to Queen's hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicion of lightweight driving.
In the meantime, he was released on cheese.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey strived to join the European Union, the European forces were interested in deepening into the country of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, one of the finest relics of this failured calcious striving.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least what the guide tells you.
The building is located at the end of the train station with a tower on each corner of the front and looks like some provincial German townhouse.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is scattered about
But if you are once within the cloudy ticket switch, there is no doubt about the profoundness of the project, whose western access it was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolien-Bagdad Society.
Germany, who was a late winner in the imperialist game, had to dominate before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Bagdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany's imperialist project was awarded during the first world war.
His railway rails were attacked by Lawrence by Arabia and his Arabians.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, produced by the unforeseen limits of the cold war, is lost.
British forces moved out of Egypt and forced the doors and their German covenants from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917 a munition pulled into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly fallen, far over from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gate to Anatoly and all east of it to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizon of Tükey.
The ACP has introduced a complete new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions produced by the limits of the Cold War is lost.
Now there is a policy of approach.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitter groups of Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and of course to the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the corner data of this new foreign policy, I went to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish Members of Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hole journey to glies that produced the equality of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I came to the Turkish capital, which was considered to be a new city for the new worldly governmental projects to return to the past Osmania.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has triggered some misunderstanding in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the main business office of the ACP, a specially manufactured, ultramodern stone and steel construction, in a developed predator, surrounded by half finished shopping centers and knees in which middle managers were in attractions, both men and women, to close the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right policyman of almost any other political party of Europe.
Attraction, crawatte, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the foreign policy of the party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its direct neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exceptional vision," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from her country.
Today she has to look at East and West at the same time.
It wouldn't be either the one or the other.
She's got to do both.
"But surely Turkey could sometime," I asked, "deciding to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "will not have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that nearly everybody I spoke here almost routinely: the relations of Turkey, not only the Middle East, but also the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are the same advantage for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transmitted sense, Europe can drive as a whole to straight railway rail east direction Asia and the Middle East.
Back to the Hydarpashas Train Station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German governments Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had seen 100 years ago when building this building.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too wide parts, be in Turkey's hands.
And when I waited at the investor for the ferry that should bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least there seemed not to be a lot of doubt about which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon was "Tod" Handley (Afruf on September 11,) responsible for the Guildford Philharmonics and Chor.
As part of his musical program for the city, he founded his great youth chor, Proteus.
He was thought for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir last singed in 1979 some of us already at the end of 20 - we refused to leave the choir alone.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer) stands for the willingness and ability of the chore, any musical piece that it was presented to attack, regardless of whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or full orchestra.
The musical versatileness of such a young chore was often amazing, always exciting and was only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for music that never read after years.
How often we thought of death to "speak music for ourselves".
He kept saying, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings!"
His kind of conduct was absolutely clear and precise, never predominant but never excessive.
As always the musical level was, he always demanded a higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beat to the rider, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonics.
In the last 40 years, I have written criticisms for more than a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal moderation.
He despised Dirigents who, according to his words, went home with one or two well-known skeletons in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
In your revocation for William Woodruff (25 September), you write that "he took over the teaching of the economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman Research College in 1950 ... while he studied at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a PhD degree.
This is a conclusion from an author note in Woodruff's book "John of Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a teacher of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and during this period he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, who later published as "The British Caution Industry".
He was in 1950-1951 in the United States under a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universitys of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham final and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to intervene this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and life' because his photographs are fantastic in black-white, in documentary style.
They made me attention to them because of their embarrassment and the power they embraced, as they always deal with respect for protagonists.
A exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments."
Second round of excellent sale at Honda.
In November Honda begins with the marketing of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, these large-scalelimousines still offered a much greater.
This also includes technical fines that enable even more comfortable driving and petrol.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, as the aesthetic, the new jazz reveals a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this grandlimousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism are emphasized.
Nevertheless, before starting to analyse the new model, one must say that this new Jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda created to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most commonly sold car of 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After the jazz appeared on the market, some million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second paragraph market was the old continent, with about half million cars sold in six years.
However, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars, which are 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
For the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, which are 6.7% of the total sale at Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to intervene the sales of sales in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to end the year with total sales of 22 000 models, which are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain compared to the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda sets up a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters length to sell the Japanese company about 200 000 models per year throughout the world.
According to the Japanese producer’s market estimates, 50 % of Insight models will be sold in the United States, while remaining share is distributed on the old continent and Japan.
For the first months of the year, the opening of the market will take place in Valencia for the first time in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimetres), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to assume that it has grown to 5 centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase of dimensions, the interior is also increased.
On the one hand, this success is the new spare flexibility program and, on the other hand, the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
Also the capacity of the case room, which has a double loading area system, reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation of the case.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litres petrol engine, as the capacity of the honey jazz cake capacity is 379 litres with a 1.2 litres benzine engine.
Among other improvements, except the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of building panoramic windows, a improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, while the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of his marketing, this small model has 2 designs of petrol engines: 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, have excellent technical performance and simultaneously turning power for the entire engine runtime.
The first variant of 1.2 litres achieves the performance of 90 PS at 6 000 rotations with a maximum rotation of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 output of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine reached during the previous 83 PS generation, he now creates 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of gas consumption and 128 grams of CO2.
'Auto-Biene' that avoids collisions
To promote the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, said more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight to the warming of bees goes back and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and is the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the Nissan Motor Co technical development centre have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology from the renowned University of Tokio (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-fold Nissan security shield.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
But the most important are the facetten auctions of the bees that can see over a angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing her to fly without interruption in their personal airspace.
In order to imply the round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called laser range Finder (LRF).
It observes obstacles that are in distance to two meters before the BR23C and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance up to the object and sends a signal to a plate-owned microprocessor which is directly translated into signal for the avoidance of the collision
`In the moment when obstacle is observed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning his wheels around 90o or even larger angle to avoid the collision.
The greatest difference to other systems is that this back-up manoeuvre takes place absolutely instinktiv.
If it was not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'tosheyuki Andoh, director of the mobility laboratory and governing engineering of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot cannot turn to top or down but also not overclock; it can only move to two dimensions and in the direction that enables him to rotate his wheels and not infinite directions and infinite way as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and abbreviation functions so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
`This device only needs to process the information for a few seconds and act according to this information.
It does not require the information nor the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres made, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the disk space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of the collisions, a technology which will be used to prophesie Nissan during the next ten years with serial cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and keep longer as a diversity of lithium iron batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the goal of driving and avoiding obstacles in the way.
She's at the seat before she's being charged with a mortgage.
It is necessary to see that the United States Ministry of Finance, except that it has a sufficient liquidity to provide support, but is not without swiftness.
Before the crisis and to avoid the development of the US citizens in hypothecical stories of the supposedly payable banks, it was developed a sustainable and informative game for the Internet surfer: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of Bad Credits' or the deal.
The third aspect of this accommodation and his receptionist is to consider two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, what is probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
It's rather one side for the teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the rise of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) to her company, which would be the first bank in Japan which will spend 9 billion dollars and thus take 21% of its capital, a new one due to a strong case of their stock exchange course.
One week after a provisional agreement was made public, the two banks explained that MUFG will buy 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley Foundations for the uniform price of $25.25, which is a total amount of $3 billion.
The accepted price is less than 19% of the share's price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the purchase of convertable shares, which will be guaranteed to ensure a profit of 10% and can be sold again at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business is being done on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, Morgan Stanley acted at 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to $23.07.
'This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank', said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing him to expand its business into new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection to MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more careful position than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last days: Last Monday Morgan had clearly explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
'A week ago', in Tokyo Toshide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, 'we thought that the participation would be completely consisting of tribal actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and ensure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% under their price for its Morgan Stanley activity.
And the business will be deducted by about 20% per share with a reduction in profit.
The agreement suggests that MUFG will be able to transform half of its preferential shares into stem shares in one year if the latter will be exchanged to more than 50% over the sale value within a given time period, i.e. to approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds delivered by MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase its sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to make more detailed information about the strategic projects of the two new associations.
According to the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance has been reduced since the end of August.
The last weeks were hard for the group that had to look at how her stock course decreased around half, while the price for insurance rapidly fastened against payment inability.
This price decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, any other `Translative' of the large investment banks at Wall Street after the course of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, $15 billion, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic around the 21st century renewed.
This is the joint project of Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
Those third party, following this Sunday, the example of his family and friends, made the plan of a new constitution.
mission met, because according to the 80% of the electoral votes, public results agreed in the national vote 64% with 'Ja'.
According to these results, 28% agreed with 'no', 7% of the vote counts were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order to adopt the constitutional project, one voice must be reached more than half of all votes given.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exits of the election locals and a counterparty of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for 'Ja', and 63% to 70% prophesie.
In the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa asked the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed' in an overwhelming way, he had reassured the status of the government in Guayaquil, 280 km southwest of Quito, and gratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his chilenian, Michelle Bachelett.
The election, which was held in the silence in accordance with the Observatory of the United States Organisation (OAS), refers to a text of 444 points to the protection of 'new socialism', for which the President is engaged.
The Constitutional Project transmits state violence to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'Development Planning' into a country that is widespread of the oil promotion by foreign companies and by the devisors, to the country.
The project, which is selected by the Correa in 2006, also increases more comprehensive power to the Head of State, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of each four years, and will have the possibility to resolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and training that the President has already started to introduce with 13,9 million inhabitants in this country, where 50% of the population is below the poverty limit.
Finally, she also proposes to forbid the presence of foreign forces, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorian base as an exit station for American antidrogen revenues.
The 19 sculptors were released in the damage
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been arrested ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were arrested for eleven days in the wilderness were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were freed by an Egyptian command in tschad.
At 15.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft, the hosts reached the military base of al-Maza right next to the international airport of Kairo.
They were brought directly without being able to speak to the press on board a helicopter to Maadi's hospital, a foreign district of Kairo, to be studied there.
They are all 'best health' and the distributors' who did not pay a solvent', said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the Rollfeld.
After she was caught on 19 September at a garage car safari at the foot of the Ouanat mountain in the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of prisoners was always brought from 35 unknown kidnappers from the hidden.
It is 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a rumine - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeures, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus Agency, organizer of Safari.
An Egyptian security controller explained that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopter, started the attack nights, just before the morning damp.
'On both sides, shots fell, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest of the flew', said this responsible person who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that in total 150 members of Egyptian special units were sent to Sudan, where they received support by German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrad, where he is located, about the role, the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
'We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and from special units', he explained without further details.
He also refused that a ransom was paid.
The sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a vessel in a patrol in which the kidnappers were six, including the leaders of the Thad, killed and two arrests.
The army stated that in connection with a rebel group of Darfour, the movement of Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), however, was immediately in line with this movement.
Letters - The quiet majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current election campaign.
That's better.
But a field of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will stand up and call for the peasant sums granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical locations that are slowly disgraced?
What politicians will be able to remind the Federal Government that she is neglecting their monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as Canada, which effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides 3,5 million euros only for the restoration of the Chinon castle in the Loiretal?
Our American neighbours are written in the constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected from all citizens, all Members and all governments in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of Quebec’s history societies, at least 400,000 officials who are gathered in 211 historians are trying to get intensively discussed with history, with a few sizes to save the numerous private archives, and to get the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guard dogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when supporters and decision-makers leave their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and culture heritage?
Benelux governments Stately Parts of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries of the US financial crisis in Turbulenzen want to intervene the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank under the arms: the three countries provide a total of EUR 11,2 billion to the bank and insurance institution, which, on the other hand, has an insurance in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the commissioner of the European Commission's competition authority.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been held for a year, so the decision that is now being taken in connection with the bank could have precision characters.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank to about 49 percent.
The Bank will probably sell a part of its participants, all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis have begun a steep trip last week, in the second half of the week, have already marked serious crisis scenarios.
However, analytics agree that the bank is too large with its 85.000 employees for a plead.
The institution's securities have fallen by 12% on a 14-year-old date on Friday.
The value of the shares has been reduced by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the group’s market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to management.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the thus triggered uncertainty on markets is debt on the Talking of Fortis acts.
However, on Monday the courses have been slightly increased.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new Director of the Bank.
The money institute was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interest with a material offer.
However, the Belgian government was struggling for restoration - no investor was supposed to quote his money, it said.
Among the customers, no panic has been broken out, the bank branches were not stimulated.
In Hungary the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies her own.
Fuchs in chickenstall
Due to the medical consumption of a person, life and health insurance are often refused to end a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could be uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that connect the use of medicine data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the Fuchs the Hühner" - quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, developers of the program for tracking descriptive data.
Insurances shall determine the fees as well as the payment fees in the case of damage depending on the condition of health of the customer, and the risk should be estimated too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical investigation, and the contract was only completed in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick found a far cheaper method: On the basis of the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years by the pharmacists, speaking what preparations have been purchased, and the program calculates from which the customer's disease is suffering and how his health is available.
For example, if he regularly buys large quantities of cholesterol inferior medicines, it has caused that his blood fat levels are untreated, which would automatically drive him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the programme in turn - some even define a risk multiplicator, so that insurance has to be done only more to the paper; however, there are smaller problems.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for different purposes, such as against migraine and heatwalls, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the view of the insurers while the above is not a matter of view.
For the application and processing of the data, own companies have formed before referring to the data to the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do this by law, although insurrections have not been entrusted.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and connect them to the data about the drug consumption. They provide an even more precise picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and controlling their use will be more difficult at the same time.
There is a private health protection law, but its impact only extends to healthcare providers and insurance services.
The draft law was already submitted to the Congress, which could also control the authorities of data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be transmitted with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned may hardly suspend access to his data, as the insuranceers otherwise do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left somewhat the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main theme in addition to other global problems in the nineth summit meeting.
Today, the French-indicated summit will be held, mostly discussed about the cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is a prosperous, democratic great power, which should be given more votes and talks at international level, the Member States have not yet been able to support the permanent membership of Neu-Delhis in the UN Security Council, or not.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit meeting in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and EU President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commissioner José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian President of Manmohan Singh. A agreement was made to double trade in the next five years, i.e. to be increased by a good 100 billion euro.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 had risen from 25 to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil flight agreements with India were legally compiled into an agreement, so that air transport is also in the future.
By 2009, India wishes to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the package.
The aim is to produce an balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is one of India's partners, Neu-Delhi is only on Rank nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
On the other hand, the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including terrorism, was condemned at the worst sides, and the calling for an UN conference was urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides wear guilty on the deceased.
The EU stressed that it maintained its energy and climate programme, i.e. that the emissions of pollutants are to be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to close a kind of global compromise in the next climate summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 2050 by 50 percent.
The price increase in food should also be combated, so both support the calling of an international conference on financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Head of State visits the French capital, where it will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, one hopes for orders to French companies in value of EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
The agreement should be decided on 15 years according to the notifications of the Agency.
Over 300 Italian publisher in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publisher at the International Frankfurt Bookmesse.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the marketing of rights.
The international Frankfurt bookmesse expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the present event. They will distribute over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and propose more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary gas of the event.
The Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will represent the 264 qm large exhibition room "Punto Italia".
This will follow a press conference close to the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion digits, trends and perspectives around the publishing system in Italy are discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers takes down in all, but in particular in adults and youth savings.
The small aircraft of the Milliardär Steve Fossett disappeared a year ago
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, which was lost on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the wilderness of Nevada, was found.
The individual parts are found on a high plateau of 3000 m, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, in the inside of the plane no human remains found themselves.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully dismissed the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized, which has been sent out a truck. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the aircraft or its neighborhood.
The 63-year-old billion was explained for death in February.
The U.S. Office for Transport Safety (Ntsb) noted that a team has been sent out a few hours after the plane has been viewed, which identified the machine: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, who was lost on 3 September 2007 after Fossett in Yerington in Nevada started a 3-hour flight.
Lastly, also in California, the border to Nevada, was found some of the personal objects of Fossett by a couple near her house at the Mammoth Lakes.
It is two designs called Fossetts, which were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was given a month after its disappearance.
The billionary had conquered a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, in the sixth run, the first man reached the worldball in a Heiss Airballon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later he surrounded the world in a single flight without interior landing with a plane.
Among its many records, a high flight of 15445 m is also above the Andes, but this with a co-pile.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv falling from the conventional schemata by its original design and the special line guide, the outloading surface and its clear angle.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this officer to get into the sector new breathe.
Due to its exceptional properties, the idea of Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising garbage, which will accompany the appearing of the new model, will also occur in new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a newness in the autosector in the returning Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping miles, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will be formed from the presentation of the car, with 3D brills that are distributed near the Corso Como, to give the whole a special optic: the new Suv will appear in its nearly real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will seem to be found from the paste on which it is trained.
With the help of the Elumina8-technology of the new Glk in various moments, its details will be illuminated in order to reconcile it as a whole.
There is no doubt that Mercedes's concern with this advertising is to introduce a new type of author class in this more stereotype field.
But will it succeed in traveling the interest of the future buyer? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stage ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for which whole Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", who has been traveling behind the Italian national team for years and who, honestly said, have not recently caused serious problems.
Never before it came to collapse with opponent fans.
The group's origin is in the right environment.
The supporters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
There were other smaller groups from Kampanies and Apulia in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of militants appear: but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria it was now a collapse with a truly legal radical fanszene, that of Levski.
The Figc had been made available to the Italian fans 144 cards for the game: all were issued on name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal: no one had a running stage prohibition process under the traveling to Sofia.
Four fans of the Italian team, which had already been preloaded in this respect, were also rejected the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to introduce further steps: in this case, the arrested or outbreaked Tifosi can expect a stage ban of at least five years.
It is an international ban that prevents access to stakeholders throughout Europe.
So our Hooligans will no longer put a foot into a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there are fears of imitation, which could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be taken out immediately, and that there is no such behaviour in any case the possibility of justifying," says the Viminal.
Therefore, "Augen, above all, with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, Apulia is a small core of the Italian ultras.
In the morning, the Osservatorio (sport oversight), on Tuesday the casms, which can be included in part of the aise, i.e. the secret services involved in the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the lifted right arm during the hymn of Mameli? This is not a crime in Bulgaria..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (in unusually expressed), which has been the director of the Osser vatorio on the vitamin for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Before, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but doubtless the behavior of these 150-200 people was a harm.
"I am not a sociologist – adding the No. 1 of the Osser venatorio – crimes are committed in the country of their deed.
So far this group had been in the magic, but now it has to be considered what happened and happening.
But we also talk about the puffs during the hymn Mamelis: even though this is not a crime, they allow me, there is still a lack of education...".
