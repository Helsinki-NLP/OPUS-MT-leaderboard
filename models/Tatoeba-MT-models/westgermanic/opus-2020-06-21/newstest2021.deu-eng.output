Discussion on the dismantling of the 50+1 rules
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended to reflect on the elimination of 50+1 rules.
"The German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said Grindel of the "image on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the associations that can be dangerous at the best Bavarian and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work at all: see Leipzig or Leverkuss.
In so far as the debate is concerned, whether it is not commanded to break in associations in this phalanx to facilitate the involvement of investors."
But he doubts whether the German soccer Liga is willing to allow majority participations that are prohibited by the 50+1 rules in the Bundesliga.
"It remains a legal risk of attracting investment in a European internal market in order to attract the state of the state of Bundesliga," said Grindel.
The former DFB-Chef sees the danger that "the attempts to provide more competitive balance in the Federal League are only weakening the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level but do not lead to more voltage in the Championship".
Even a equal distribution of TV painters will not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already impersonal among the first three associations.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," explained 58 years old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Leider has found there people who noticed this error and have swallowed to the press instead of responding to it," said Grindel about the adoption of a expensive clock that had led to his return in April 2019.
"It's really very busy me."
The gift in value of around 1,000 euros had been given by an Ukrainian functionary.
"I've committed a compliance infringement, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"With the infinite clock gift, I went completely transparent and roughly.
It knew many in the DFB of it."
He never made "a heal from the gift," assured 58-year-old.
"This may be called naiv, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Argentina refuses counterparty of the creditors
The new claims could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires shared on Saturday.
"That would not only be unresponsibly, but also injustice," said one opinion.
"When 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our believers."
The debts of the second largest national economy in South America are no longer sustainable to the current conditions.
Hence, Argentina calls on his private creditors to dismiss some of its claims of around 66 billion US dollars (rund 59 billion euros).

She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city in Regensburg as judge at the Landgericht.
At least, her husband has been able to request a short-term parent time to ensure that the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old) are cared for.
In order not to have a pendels every day from Regensburg, she has a overnight opportunity for her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
In the neighboring country district, it is of course a long time a term for you to grow up in the town of Eggenfelden.
When visiting the place with her family in recent months, she has then discovered recently: "Eggenfelden is a very beautiful small town."
In this way, she was pleased that they had made the race in the selection procedure around the free body.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer's career course also plays a central role in her home of Niederbayern: After the Jura study in Passau, she gave her referendariat time and the 2nd state examen in Regensburg.

Calbitz tube from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Figure"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from AfD is only a "fig sheet" in view of the FDP and does not change anything on the character of the party.
"The Afd is the Parliamentary Arm of the Rights Exrems in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the Radicals in the AfD," said Benjamin Strasser FDP politician of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The AfD Federal Division Court had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiation the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board had decided to do so multitude in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the Afd really would be about removing legal ekstremists consistently from her party, functionaries like Björn Häcke would have been excluded as well as its followers long ago," said Strasser.
"But there is no political will in AfD because the legal extremism is part of the party now".
Similarly, CSU-General Secretary Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and does not change," he said the world on Sunday.
"It is rather speaking volumes, how many frenetic supporters still have a legal extractor in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will come back under five percent in the future for elections.
"The days of the Afd in Parliaments are counted".
Kalbitz was one of the officially dissolved "flights" for the Thüringer AfD-Country and Group Chairs Björn Höcke; Constitutional Protection is a "protective legal extremist effort".
In May the AfD-Bundes Board Kalbitz had thrown out of the party.
As a reason, Kalbitz stated that he did not specify an earlier membership in the now prohibited legal extreme "Heimat faithful German Youth" (HDJ) and the Republicans.
Kalbitz contradicts membership in HDJ.
The President of the Left Fraction in Brandenburg's Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Division Court was not changing the character of AfD: "The Wolf has only eaten Kreide.
The AfD remains a legal extraction party, whether with or without calfitz.
The Federal Party is not being weakened by this decision nor the right wing.
"The manoeuvre of the mouthen truppe is visible.
You want to escape a further perception through constitutional protection and try to get through the radar," Walter said.
"The Afd is not going to leave the spirits that she called.
There is no change in a noise," commented the Brandenburger SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn, in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the Group held their right leader until today".
The legal conflict on the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday that he will now act civilly against the decision of the Federal Division Court.
North Sea-Windparks deliver good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year 11,51, the wind power plants on the German North Sea have slipped electricity into the network.
This is about 21 percent more than the same period in the previous year, the network operator Tennet shared in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transfer of the North Sea strike to the mainland and the transit through the German electricity network.
The wind plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the network area of Tennet, have squeezed more than 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh).
The wind current from North and Eastern Sea is thus coming to 13,73 TWh, compared to 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Thus, the windernts on the sea are almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which are about four percent points more than one year ago.
New wind parks provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of the offshore wind energy is next to the wind conditions of higher production capacities because new wind parks have gone to the network over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were running all simultaneously with full power, they could generate 6,7 gigawatt electricity.
The transfer capacity is sufficient for this; it is according to tennet 7.1 Gigawatt.
Until 2030 it is supposed to rise to 17 Gigawatt in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can also not exploit their capacity on the sea, but reach some 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is the 2nd January when the North Sea Wind Parks generated more than six Gigawatt electricity.
In the average, the North Sea-Windcycles produce about 2.5 to 3.0 Gigawatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide almost seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windbergfest wegen Corona deposited
The windberg festival is not held this year.
The city of Freital has dealt with the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 300,000 people visited this city festival.
"We did not really make this decision easy and - in consciousness how difficult it is for the parties - hoped for the last minute," said Oberbürgermeister Uwe Rumberg (partyless).
"But finally we are here as an organizer for the health of many thousand people."
For if tens of thousands were flown to the fortress and to the fixed, minimum levels, hygiene regulations and contact follow-up could not be observed in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the limitations would have been so strong that a people's festival would not be far left.
In addition, organisational and supervisory effort would increase in proportional terms.
Rumberg destroyed the next year.
Then the city celebrates her 100-year-old existence, including the winter mountain festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Sachsen from 10 to 12 September 2021.

More flight slots in Worms
The Wormser University continues to be in the venues: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" stimulates a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first completed for three years and started 2021.
With the professorship, the possibility is to allow study starts not only in summer but also in winter semester.
This allows double education of as many students as before.
At the same time, the capacity in both the university and the DFS air insurance academic is equally exhausted.
The DFS will advise the university in the establishment and occupation of professionals.
Since 2019 at the university
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students are in the framework of their training to the flight slots at the University of Worms in the Air Traffic Management study course.
Nine students started this year.
So far the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the performances of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery education is essentially helping to further increase the attractiveness of Lotsen' profession.
"In these times, the promotion of economically is not easy.
However, we are sure that air transport is recovering and a long-term resume.
In the future, we need highly qualified staff, too, in order to comply with our legal order," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, chairman of the DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation's professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide long-term flight slots with a broad, professional knowledge base.
We therefore continue to cooperate with the universities and undermine our attractiveness as a employer at the same time."
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, president of the University of Worms: "The foundation professor is an important bridge between science and economy.
With her we want to join the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for dual Bachelor Studies Service Air Traffic Management".
The trust of the German air insurance is for the University of Worm's motivation and commitment to further develop their education and research expertise in the future areas of air transport.
In the use of the tomorrow flight slots, the university with the first professorship of the Foundation for a dual study course could set very special highlights and innovative focuses for their students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, stresses: "The University Worms has a single setting feature in Rheinland-Pfalz with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the universities."

Healing wants to check for meat industry other industries
The Corona crisis again brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light.
Legal impediments occur shortly.
But are they right - and will they stay in it?
Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in the flesh industry, in accordance with the strict rules currently planned.
"We will watch our industry and then take appropriate measures for the sector if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer has already warned to limit contracts generally.
After the massive Corona breakthrough in the meatries of Tonnnie in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to decide a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
Great slaughterships should not be allowed to use foreign personnel in the case of slaughter, smuggling and meat processing.
This is to prohibit the use of work contracts and bodies there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger is away from a general restriction of contracts and employment agreements, if you don't want to disregard the economy."
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for their value added to the customer for far areas of handicraft, construction and plant construction.
"The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts throughout the German economy."
Work contracts are useful.
"If an industrial company commissions a workman to build a security plant, this is a very normal work contract."
The German meat industry holds a ban on work contracts and bodyworks alone in its industry for unconstitutional.
It is not explicit why, in the future, the portion and packaging of cheese should apply other work law than with Wurst, it states in a opinion on the legal project, such as the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Samstag).
A ban would therefore increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Several Eastern European workers from work contracts worked in the industry after the results of a review of the NRW protection management partly 16 hours a day.
They often didn't have a break.
Loans were maintained for protection equipment or rent.
It was also established that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
He said that the meat industry had already entered a relatively sharp law for 2017.
However, these were handled by "tricky constructions".
"Now it must be cleared fundamentally."
The Politician announced: "In the labour protection law we want to decide in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that concern not only the meat industry - for example higher test rates of work protection or clear criteria for Community accommodations".
The draft of the DPA includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat economy and the law on protection of workers.
Brandenburg's consumer protection minister Ursula Ninnemacher (Green) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to make more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal protection, all possible, for example animal transports," said Ninnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg current".
However, more staff are needed for more controls.

Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a dissolving gate of Cristiano Ronaldo, the Italian Champion Juventus Turin has secured himself for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total 36th Scudetto of the association history with a 2:0 (1:0) in the home game against Sampdoria Genua perfect on Sunday evening.
Ronaldo met 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, who is without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer experiencing two days before the season of the series A.
The Inter Mailand table-wide table is seven points back.
Despite optical embarrassment in the first half of time, Ronaldo met after a release variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old by Miralem Pjanic rated directly with a flat committee (45.+7).
==References====External links====External links==*Official links==*References====External links==*Official website
This was guaranteed by the glanzless but crucial success.
The sweated foul meters to the late in the 89. minute only Ronaldo himself may have annoyed the Torjäger rating correctly.
"It is complicated to stay at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said trainer Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve-Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turinns couldn't have made the Championship perfect yet.
At the end, Juve last had to thank the weakness of the competitors for the end.
Because in the 11 parties before the game on Sunday, Sarri managed only five wins.
The question is whether Ronaldo still becomes turbulent royal.
Because during the Portuguese Superstar until 31 gates, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already met 34 hit his account after its three pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the Lazio Rome Table Four at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title gain of the FC Bayern.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinian reached 36 gates for the SSC Neapel in the 2015-2016 season.
In August the "Alte Dame" of the Italian football is waiting for the next track.
Juventus, however, is in the Achtelfinale of the Champions League, but on 7 August, Olympique Lyon has to make a 0:1-Hinplaypleite to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o.-Runde, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal authors recorded
Stuttgart - All threatened criminals and court judgments despite giving car drivers in countless illegal races on the bathing-wiertemberg roads still gas: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal cars in the Southwest.
Comparison values for the years earlier are not available, but the Rasers make the judicial authorities more and more working: In the national lawyers between Constance and Mannheim, in 2018, there were a total of 155 research procedures for illegal races, a year later there were 252 and 151 already in the current year until the beginning of June.
The races were less organized, as the response of the Ministry of Interior to a request from the Country Days SPD.
In most cases the drivers were spontaneously encountered or had taken the escape before the police - even this is shown as illegal races.
On the tax, especially German men in the ages between 18 and 60.
113 Money penalty - 15 times liability
Only in comparatively few cases, the rasers will be whispered and also asked for the cash: According to the Ministry of Interior, in total 113 money penalties have been imposed since 2018 and 15 liberty penalties have been expressed.
However, there are no points of view that the number of illegal authors actually increase.
More often, other drivers responded more sensitive than before, because of the many tragic accidents and processes in recent years, a ministerial speaker said.
Especially popular in Rasern, the car 8 is always brimming car drivers there to take place and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen driver was caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months before it was even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "Rennstrecken"
On the A81 the police registers even more races than on any other Federal Carbahn.
With a rate limit there, the raser is attempted to break out the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
Most of the highly prized and exhausted sports and luxury crews often have Swiss marks because the drivers deviate to Germany because of the high penalties for fast driving and authorships in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the tempo limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general rate of 130 hours kilometers of pace, we would create this problem on carbahns from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD country day Fraction.
"The inhibition wave for Raser would be significantly higher if you should not be here and there still be legally with 200 hours kilometers and more on the way."
Of clarification or image campaigns Rivoir holds less: "Who is so moving over all rules and not just puts up their own life, but also the life of other transport participants is hardly accessible with reason."
ADAC calls for increased cops with the police
On the other hand, ADAC is not enough: "We assume that Raser is not allowed to retired from the tempo limits," says Holger Bach, Department Director of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and lower controls on the routes concerned.
It is not rare that the high-to-turn force measure is more painful and follow-up serious: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died in the races, two unparticipated in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city and one in Gerlingen.
There two young men were supposed to have delivered a authorship in November.
One of the vehicles came from the street, stroke against a garden wall and stood on the side, who died 18-year-old driver.
21 more people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, sharper penalties are not necessary by interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "The need for action to improve illegal automobile races is not seen in the document of the Interior Ministry.

Working agency figures: 900 suspicion cases for short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Office for Work (BA) according to its own statement, approximately 900 suspicions on abuse in short-term labour money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have shown short work," said the Executive Board Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurt General Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies had suddenly requested short work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available in this hot phase.
We will look at the final accounts more precisely.
It'll certainly be a little more.
We're not naive and have a long breath."
Notes on abuse are often given by the employees or trade unions concerned.
Then use the BA analysis software to detect abuse patterns.

The assessments are disagreed, but we are wailing for the case of the case, and now our employees are being trained in the working agencies for the processing of insolvency fee applications."
The figures were still unreasonable, said Terzenbach.

Manchester United went to lead through a crime of Bruno Fernandes (71 minutes).

Chelsea, in the Champions-League-Achtelfinale opponents of the FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wandererer.
"This means me a lot," said Trainer Frank Lampard, who was also at the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
From Chelseas Sieg against Wolverhampton also profited Tottenham Hotspur, which was still over the wolves with a magnificent 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started as a sixth in the Europe League.
Aston Villa decided the remote show with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for itself, but at West Ham United had to quote the class maintenance for a long time.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) was immediately from Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
But that 1:1 (0:0) was sufficient because Watford lost at Arsenal with 2:3 (1:3).
The club, shaking three trainers in the season, rises after five firstliga years.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save itself by means of a 3:1 (2:1) at the FC Everton.

North Korea has so far seen a "lightening success" in its own measures to combat the corona virus.
Now the country first reports a suspicion.
As a result of a first official corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely defeated a large city from fear of a disaster.
Despite strict epidemiological defense measures over the last six months, "the male virus has been put into the country," state media reported.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong, the emergency was linked.
Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspicious case is confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the dismissed country.
According to its own information, North Korea had not registered any infection and described its defense measures as "lightening success".
The information has been doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms have been detected in the reports of a "exploitors" who have crossed the military demarkation line between South and North Korea on 19 July illegally.
The person has dropped to South Korea three years ago and has now returned to the border.
For the cross-border crossing within the four kilometres wide and most of the military buffer zone, there was no confirmation from South Korea at first.
However, after reports from Yonhap national news agency, South Korea's military was a great ability to cross-border borders to North Korea.
In this respect, investigations have been made to some people.
As a result of the sudden event, North Korea called on its own information, a urgent meeting of the Polit Office of the Worker Party under the Presidency of the Powers Partner Kim Jong Un.
The "danger situation in Kaesong could trigger a fatal and distorted disaster".
Kim has already ordered as a preventive measure to "block Käsong completely and isolate every region and region of others", said it further.

Tension before Council meeting: City ost and noise protection are still discussed by large summer breakdowns.
"None environmental topics will also vote on the construction plan for the main project of the centre of development of the city," says the city's press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 16.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Most of all, the evaluation of the east city will, however, be contradicted until the end.
The majority of them are small, lastly rejecting in individual committees depending on the presence.
A appell from the economy (build, real estate, trade and IT), which has developed from the citizenship and then developed project by the Board of Directors, not to fail after almost ten years of preparation now, criticized project entrepreneur Reinhard Klein as "apartial opposition", "onless", "speakulation", "speaking", and "conscious false statements".
"All believe to know it better," says Klein, belonging to the Council of congregations for a year as a single representative of the Pforzheim civilian list.
In fact, he was after the lecture of the Treaties in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is more cheap to the city that the Technical Rathaus is against the statements of the city administration by grants whose existence is small convinced to sanize €8.5 million.
The city will develop quite differently than prognosticize at the Council's house and by the supporters from the economy.
The city was designed by its own strength and not by an investor: that's his plan B. One day after small, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also refused the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides for the rehabilitation of the Technical Rathaus, the open maintenance of the Lockberg, the rental of the Ex-Tale for administrative surfaces and a smaller interior environment in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental topics play central role
In addition, environmental topics will play a central role.
The Council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim's population against healthy noise burdens caused by road transport, including many times temporary reductions.
In a press release, the German transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of pace 30. However, politically responsible in the city are not innocent that this should be so because they have contributed to the enormous increase in car transport and noise through the necessity of line bus transport with exposed tacts and by a lack of commitment to bicycle transport only, says the VCD.
The Council also votes on the participation of the City of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
Moreover, on the agenda of accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parent contributions in the urban childhood facilities and the application for the application to the Smart City Board of the Bundes.

Fleetwood Mac mediator Peter Green died
His life was like a backway journey: After a rasant rise with Fleetwood Mac, it went down steep mountains and then slowly upwards.
Now the Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died aged 73 years.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult attachment: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully at the age of 73 years in sleep, communicated on Saturday in an official opinion that a further opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton würdiged Green as one of the best Blues and Rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in a emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the late legendary band 1967 in London, until today it's unforgettable instrumental heat "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was a backway ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rasant rise - the band celebrated its greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there should have been disputes because Green wanted to spend all the profits of the group for well-active purposes.
He began to enter into wide jars and with great cruzifix.
It should also have played a role in psychological problems.
For three years after the establishment, Green left the band 1970.
It followed a social decline.
The Bluerock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and skizophrenia, as biographers reported.
Green was treated in psychiatry for a long time.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the area of the image.
He is supposed to live on the street time when cemetery gardener worked and spent a time in an Israeli cab.
Green was born in 1946 as a son of a Jewish worker family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
In young years he excited himself for US Blue Musicians such as King and Muddy Waters.
In 11 years he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play professional guitar and got the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
He became a substitute for his Idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues-Boom, Green founded in summer 1967 Fleetwood Mac together with his Bluesbreakers-Collegen Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The "Albatross" song, composed by Green, described the group in winter 1968/69 the first number 1 heat and catapulated it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not rape the mediarum, his experiments with the Droge LSD became more and more extreme.
Later, he commented the life between music and suffice in a interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in my life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 heat".
By the end of the decade, Green 1979 surprisingly became a success of respect with a album inspired by religious topics.
Fleetwood Mac swims without it in new formation on a wave of success.
Her album "Rumours" published in 1977 sold over 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo results, Green did not have a larger comeback until he re-established in 1996 with a group of friendly musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returned to the earth.
With the Peter Green Splinter Group, Green released free of drugs, some albums until the band was released in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a Blues-Legende - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists in the past decades.
