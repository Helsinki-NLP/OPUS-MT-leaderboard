Goodness: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres away from each other: on Tuesday, the new B 33-footing disaster at the village parking site has been operated in the sight of the older rathausampel.
Two plants are so close to each other: intention or sign bourgeois?
This question has clearly answered Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The city houseampel has been installed at that time because it secures the school path," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser Ampel secures bicycles as well as bus passengers and the mountain residents.
The official plant taken yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank and the transport flow from the living area.
"When the high traffic and pedestrian rising up, another ampel had to be found in their security," says Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Offenburg Landratsamt.
"Laut current measurements pass around 12 000 vehicles daily on B 33, of which are about 10 percent heavy traffic," Arnold stressed.
Therefore, the construction of another ample is more necessary than "Security is just happening here," says Arnold.
In total, four traffic views have been carried out, and a circular transport has been thought, but due to the Enge in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again.
According to Arnold, in the local selection of the ampel masts, everything was tested before: "With an extra for us with particularly long wood stands of charged transport, we have arranged whether these vehicles can drive out from the Sulzbach path to B 33 without turning the ampel masts."
Arnold stated that some 15 000 euros have expensive ampel system itself is the "modernest thing that is currently on the market".
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strong that the lights of the car drivers, for example, are well recognized by the deep sun.
It is also spacious: the older lighting plants consume about 100 Watt, the new just eight Watt.
There are three lighting facilities per drive.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: this is equipped with two cycling sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the ampel button, the upper wheelar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the street is free, it will get green for the pedestrian if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another Radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people are going across the street, the green phase will be extended, so every one is surely over the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the car driver should think as a partner here and watch the road.
This wasn't the case yesterday: The municipal of pedestrians showed green, exposed a upper-class vehicle by - at bright red.
Joseph Winkler has been writing the deaths of his childhood and youth for over 30 years.
The disasters of his Catholic villagekind - the unusual language, the slope to rough violence and stubborn sexuality, the Enge and Freudlessness - have often described the Kärntner poet.
Known is the Büchner prize leader, especially as prosaautor, theatre texts are rar in his work.
Collapse from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher sets up "Wetterlights at the Century" which is now to be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, so a collapse of Prosatexts.
The theatremaker combines some elements from the autobiographic novel "The Body Owner" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, his family glorifying" (2003).
On the largely clear - important requisite: a crushed sofa that is copied and masturbated in an obsolete way - the eight-heady ensemble depends on the textual material.
The text seems to be little trusted by Regisseur Fresacher.
The 70-minute performance covers the template with a fill of regime incidents known from the stock post-dramatic game forms.
Especially the actresses are taking place in the sometimes somewhat fragilescenic implementations.
They are hardly assembled, with the head robbed under water, with their evening robbers to the wall.
Insulated in cellophan or mieder, they stack on dangerously high stacks through the inszenation, either monologize them loud or are completely stumbled on the floor.
However, the text does not provide such an incentive way.
The best moments have the evening when sang - the bandwidth range from Deep Purple to national songs.
First to the end, the overwhelmed performance comes to a tranquility, and Winkler's snatching mad Humor blews on.
A blackbox in the car?
U.S.A. street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the loss of highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the armature board of every car.
The devices recording each kilometer and reporting information to the authorities are the main point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the Federal Planning Offices to re-establish the obsolete system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly developed an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Liberaries have been bound with environmental groups and speak that the government can use the small boxes for recording the driven kilometers – and perhaps where they were driven — and then use the information for the calculation of tax separation.
The Tea Party is defeated.
The U.S. Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while there is no way to take action in the convention, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, with which drivers pay per driving mile.
Thousands of car drivers have already tested the drivers, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
That's really a must for our country.
“It is nothing that we will only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments planting a recording of the rising miles in all kalifornian car drivers in the state of the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed from the taxes, is placed to the US American at the drop pillar.
But in America there is no more done as much as before.
Cars consume less petrol.
The State Mineral oil tax of 18.4 Cent per gallone (less than 4 Eurocent per litre) has not increased since 20 years.
Politicians do not wage high rates, even in order to raise the tax.
"The petrol tax is simply not available," says Lee Munnich, a expert for transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a metal-based payment system.
"This represents the most useful alternative for long-term time," he said.
Office crates describe it as a miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberals, for for example, the tax was used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce exhausts and air conditional exhausts.
The kalifornic plans set up the system for the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally propagated objectives of the state of climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, President of the House Transportation Committee, also explained that he sees the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of allowing drivers to pay for the backed route.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," says Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Reason Directives.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers, who had called on a report in 2011 to move to Milan-based deduction.
The US Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that had included 100,000 cars.
However, the majority in the representative house prevented the prevention and responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas representing people who often have to relocate many miles on the way to work or to the city everyday.
Several governments and large cities are in no way moving to their own hands in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, currently awarding 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment of the country.
These drivers will soon pay the milesnotes instead of the mineral oil tax to the State of Germany.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers this.
Illinois tests it in limited dimensions with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the Ministrys of Transport of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptical in thinking that the government could follow each of their movements.
“Environment to Big Brother and such things were a major problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Result Management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People didn't want it.
When the test occurred, the Nevada ACLU warned on her website: “It would be relatively easy to change the drivers into adult monitoring equipment."
There is no need to build a gigantic, blocked technological infrastructure that would be used unnecessaryly to cover data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of staten, which now looks forward to the thorough technology that the state can cover the rising kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
That's what Khan said would be more calm for the public.
The hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small launch company called True Mileage in California.
The company has not originally entered to help state states in the taxation of car drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take foot in a thrilling market for car insurance in which drivers should pay on the basis of the driven miles.
But the devices tested by her are also interesting for the street schedulers because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
“The people are rather willing to participate in when their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have made great mistakes.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive opportunities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment to give car drivers a series of selection options.
You can choose for a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't choose any device and pay a fee on the basis of the average miles driven by all the people of the state.
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a misstrauous public by providing the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, transport officers want to develop a device for taxation, which also allows parking fees to be paid, insurance only for rising kilometers and retaining speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which car drivers can soften.
“Automobiles would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system", says a city planning document.
However, some transport planners are wondering whether the whole talk about payments per kilometer is not only a huge delegation manoeuvre.
In the Metropolitan Transport Commission for the San Francisco Bay territory, officials stated that the convention could simply solve the problem of the bank-red highway trust fund by increasing fuel tax.
A additional single fee or an annual charge could be lodged with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient” explains Randy Rentschler, Head of Law and Public Affairs of the Commission.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of car drivers make sure of their privacy and many other things.
King field: Small team strikes awake
The volunteer fire ward its autumn main test despite the lack of staff with Bravour.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate Feder in Burgberger Straße in his exercise approach.
There's supposed to have been a short closure when saws.
Two people were injured by the founding fire and the development of smoke, but one of them could send a emergency call.
After the first review of the saccharge by Hans Kammerer, two athletic guardians made ready to enter the building.
After a short time, the first person was able to find and lead to the Free.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy as a close staircase was too overwhelmed.
The building, a workshop with integrated stallion for two horses, was not easy to safe.
It stored a lot of wood and also strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machinery for wood processing.
The first removal attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another lead was carried over an overflow hydron in about 100 meters away.
Now three removal attacks could be designed.
There was also a throat tube in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also working on the exercise to show what is available with little staff.
In the serious case, support is given to the Kingsfeld's day entry group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of exercise.
Networking of Colleges and Companies
At his visit to Breisgau-Highwarzwald, Country-Tag President Guido Wolf also explained about where the work forces come from tomorrow.
In the high-speed substitute centre, he went along with the managers of the professional schools and the circhymnasium and the parent chairs of this important question.
"Bildung is an important location factor", undersuched Claudia Steele, director of the Hans-Thomas School, who presented the networked educational project Highschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the promotion centre, circhymnasium and professional school centre in the forest city.
He also praised family friendlyness in the district.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in view, but due to demographic change also the phase for the care of family care," said Wolf.
He also suggested that more and more employees care for and care for their family members.
"Only supporting employers can lead to the resulting burden of employees to an end in working conditions," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, especially important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"When has already learned the advantages of the region during his study, with its acquired knowledge and skills, often receives the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the Country Chair was convinced.
For only if sufficient training places were offered, specialists could also be covered.
His opinion is the advantage of the district in the south-west of Germany, directly close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made to develop public transport from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Please stay hardneckig and make sure that public transport becomes better," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
With music experience a entertaining afternoon
Since 15 years, the Kaul family invites the Senioren-Seniors to coffee, cake and then to a vesper.
Earlier, the elderly fellow citizens were carried out in the rash site.
In the middle of this afternoon, St. Joseph will take place in the nursing home.
The home residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and tours.
Later there was a würstsalat.
Silvia Kimmich and her father Karl Kimmich interviewed with common melodies.
The more than 100 years old natural stone walls than the previous delimitation of the old school station on the cherch road is to be set again on the Sanation Cost Plan of the City of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was built in the first works of rehabilitation of the front school station, to stabilise and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further action is to suggest that Alexander Misok from the Bräunling City Construction Office, involves the Landesdenkmalamt into the plannings and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
Afterwards, a cost calculation is to be made by experts, which will then be put on the table to the Council of the Community for the decision and determination of further action.
A decision on this will probably fall in the next year.
After the renovation, plastering and tree planting of the old school court, within the two side-wing schools of the 1912, it must be renovated as a follow-up measure, which is reasonably refined and placed on new sub-building.
The historical, one hundred years old delimitation wall of the old school station to the Kyrchstraße, is mainly due to water and frog damages, as there is no drainage, need to renovate and have a bownation forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones prove to be damaged by weather, but the walls are currently not inclined.
A stable wall is prerequisite for one of students using school stations, which has been carried out by the current fixing work.
Originally, in 2008, school courts were already planned, but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school walling, which has even been used for film recordings, will refer to the Landesdenkmalamt.
If the conditions of this page come from, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument guards.
The students of the brewern school, which are now again informed in a well sanated old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old school court.
Ö nieteminir wants to receive Jazz training in Stuttgart
In the persistent discussions about the future of music high schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Ö Togir, the Federal President of the Greens, has now also enabled.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," said Ö Anywayir the "Stuttgarter News".
Jazz and Classic are also together at the Jazzstandort Stuttgart.
In this way, Ö Togir, who is considered to be a favorite for a direct mandate at the Bundestagswahl on 22 September, is the Green-Rot State Government.
This is based on a expert study of the five high schools in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the jazz and Pop study course from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart is intended to be stored to Mannheim's Musikhochschule.
US-Grenze: "Super-Tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, mediators have discovered and layed a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US-Sold authorities told, the more than 500 meters of the tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail glues and a ventilation plant.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tonnes of Marihuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel has not yet been used.
"These cardals are stupid if they think they could get through under the radar," said the U.S. state lawyer of the South California District, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a camphouse in San Diego, where it was discovered a end of the tunnel.
To the drug bands, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnel and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge disappointment of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent campaign against drug cards.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in the context of drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the exhaustive equipment of the tunnel, the mediators assume that he was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took account of about a year.
The gloves were so equipped that electrical vehicles could be used.
On the Mexican side the access is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a head of 20 meters leads to the depth to the real tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1,20 meters height and 90 centimeter width.
It would also be appropriate to promote the illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine found.
The third man, a Mexican, was taken over Marihuana's consultation.
All three threatened as the highest penalty of lifelong freedom, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This shows the "deficiency" of the drug bands whose traditional routes were cut down now, Bill Sherman said of the DEA drug fighting in San Diego.
They would do everything to get into the United States.
No details were given to the arrests, at least one of the mexicans, were said.
They have to expect to be arrested for up to ten years.
2014 Geising year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen at the age of 1250.
Returning the first urkundial remembrance is always closer.
If in good eight weeks the year ends, the anniversary year stands on.
Risings and church houses were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches, a research was made in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there should be an official event for the anniversary year, and since the fact that rising is currently not a hall, this event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago both were first mentioned in church houses.
In the context of the jubilee, several events are planned in both rising and church houses.
Church houses will be the 1250th in July on a holiday weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Recurrence.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall.
At this weekend, the church-house church festival is still the case.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a composition for the city on the occasion of the jubilee, which is listed on three dates.
On June 21, together with the Sunnwend celebration of the Black Forest Association, on July 12, in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13, as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and devoted in the jubileeary year, the official date is on the last September week, on 27 and 28 September.
A new Chronicle is also released on the occasion of the rising city jubilee.
"It should become a chronicle not only by risings itself but a printed work about the practising of today, which consists of rising, church houses, leopards, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen", says mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the rising of today celebrated 2014 birthday, 1974 today's space was completed with the interventions.
The new Chronicle will then be presented in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall.
In 2014, however, there is another year with many jubileans.
The Narrenzunft Stroglonki begins on 8 February with a breuchtum evening at its 60-year-old existence, the harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the festival on 29 March and then celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May.
The old work Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the rising school has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the Music Verein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the fountain festival of 4th to 7th July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a surgery, owned by St. Gallen, in the year 764.
The research was made in churches (home) which was then courtyard.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
As a result of 2014 this 1250 year according to celebration, in addition, the municipal reform is still 40 years.
The Council shall take Gleis plants to the Vise
Should the railway transition "Am Hirschen" be renovated to increase traffic safety?
Yes, have decided the municipal councils.
Shiltach must take 220 000 euros to do so.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal track in the coming year.
Especially is to increase the safety of railway transitions - regularly collisions of trains with other vehicles.
When the municipalities agree, they have to participate in the costs of a third party, the rest shares the railway and the covenant.
Schiltach's Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber explained the municipal council the features of the train transition "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build an excavation in the height of the tunnel wall west of the Bahngleise.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, in contra- traffic, without blocking the gleeze.
Grayhaber therefore suggested to build a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the next street at a certain time to ensure a smooth transport flow.
This was controversed in the municipal council, as some guessed the need for road spread in doubt: Thomas Kipp took the critic's voice to the point, "When we have to take so much money for such a few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The "Hirschen" train transition is regularly used for longwood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters could not use the route on the hemer's bridge because they couldn't turn down to the main road there.
In addition, the route as a redirection for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is locked, has argumented Haas.
Since it is noted that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel should be reconstructed and sanized as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway transition "On "Hirschen" could also come to an important use for a longer period of transport.
The Councils agreed to examine which costs would cause the distribution of the road.
Despite the fact that the necessary support walls were built so that the city could develop the next road direction "Bahnhofstraße", where appropriate, for encounterment traffic on about 5,5 meters.
On the other hand, the transformation of the railway passage in the Gerbey Trautwein could draw a very different problem in relation to the entry into the strongly rising "great house way".
The management had made the rebuilding plans of the railways from the Engineering Office Breinlinger, as she had doubts whether the planned connection of the rolling house was still possible.
The investigation resulted in the result that it was not excluded that road constraints could lead to longer vehicles.
The responsibility for this slows the city as a road-building carrier again.
The reconstruction could therefore lead to liability disputes.
As both wood exports and excavation worked in the current expansion state, Haas was not supposed to agree to the transformation of the railway transition.
Also, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than on the other railway transitions because the stop point is directly located in the middle of which is a good viewpoint.
Even trains from the main station should already be broken down in this place that no collision threats.
As the city of Schiltach had to "bad out" the problem with suspended vehicles, the railroad has been refused to be used to transform this tramway as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work was completed.
The body considered the transformations at the train transitions "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which the crossing agreements have already been met with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: billion missions
Apart from planets, waves of gravitation or black holes - experts of the European Space Agency need to start some of them in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far from worlds.
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are at least some of them's life, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you search for Gravitation Wave?
Do you rather explore the origin of the Kosmos?
Or after earthlike planets flying, perhaps discovering exterior life?
These questions are the responsibility of the European Space Agency Esa.
For her Cosmic Vision programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that should be crucial for research.
The meat for such l missions is approximately one billion euro.
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, Paris met the elite of European space research to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were to debate, five of them have now come into the closer choice.
Many bodies assess the proposals, investigating the researchers.
In the next days, a final decision is intended to be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
Overall four major questions, the Esa has chosen on which the missions of the 2007 "Cosmic Vision" programme should find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact events in the development of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the development of planets surrounding these stars - are still in the speaking darkness.
A large infrared telescope in the whole could perceive this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life create there?
To address this question, 2017 will start the World Space Telescope "Cheops", with which 500 already known planet systems are more precisely studied in our vicinity.
The opportunities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could figure earthlike planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biological brands": gases that are considered to be indice for biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question should also be included in the context of the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the participating radiation with the planet system.
In our solar system, these actions can be studied exampleally.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a M class mission (where the budget is located at about half a billion euro) for this question.
The sun should start 2017 and monitor the sun's surface and activity exactly.
From great interest in researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa is the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The Sunde "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) starts her trip, probably 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is intended to examine the atmosphere of the planet, and the frozen moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The worldall offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and so to examine whether our known natural laws are still valid there.
There may also be differences that may show the physicians the way to a new theory, under which all the well-known natural laws are united.
How has the universe been created and what does it exist?
13,7 billion years ago, our Kosmos came through the Urknall.
In addition to the matter of ours, from the stars, planets and living as we exist, there are dark matter whose difficulty of galaxy and galaxy hops are coincided, and dark energy whose work accelerates the expansion of the world all.
So far, researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the Urknall, nor what dark matter and dark energy exist.
With "Euclid" the esa has already been authorized here for a M mission whose start is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the sun aims to examine the distribution of matter in the universe first on the whole of the sky, allowing the defence of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection procedure.
The best opportunities for a consent as L mission have, according to many experts, "E-Lisa", a demanding concept of detection of gravitation waves.
Under this, physicians understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had foretold almost 100 years ago.
They were not confirmed until today.
Elisa could create this, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a two or three-third detector, which is stationed in the All.
In contrast to plants on earth, he could also demonstrate gravitation waves that have been created at the Urknall and thus deliver new knowledge about the origin of the Kosmos.
Four further proposals are compete with the second L mission: a large X-gattescope called "Athena", which, among other things, wants to research black holes, "Icy Planets", a further mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is supposed to see and examine earthlike planets.
There are also proposals concerning the maritime retreatment of samples, the research of moon, venues and asteroids and solar physics.
Snowden willing to “copie” with Germany in terms of US monitoring
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, has declared that he was ready to travel to Berlin and to express an answer on their activities before the German Bundestag, when the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers on their activities.
The German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum received to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, which was presented on Friday by Ströbele to the media in Berlin, this writes: “If the result of my efforts proved positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a defense break and is trying to criminalize political opinion with criminal threat that is not possible to defense.”
But it is not a crime to say the truth.
In the letter Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government of leaving the claims against him.
The claims raised by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include spionage and thebstahl of state property.
The German Minister of Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said on time Online: “If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives, then we find ways to enable that."
The relationships between the United States and Germany are charged by the claims that NSA has heard the phone of Kanzler Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of the Parliament responsible for secret service, stated that we should take the opportunity to listen to snow as witness, if possible, to “follow him without any danger and to ruin the relationships with the United States.”
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and snowed in his Twitter Fed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists at his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA co-worker Snowden, he could not return to Russia when he leaves the country.
If Snowden expresses in Germany, he need a guarantee that he is "security" there, the Member of the Commission.
Snowden explains in his letter that he suspends himself to be a “advanced and continuing” persecution campaign that has distributed him from his homeland.
It was, however, affected by the global response to “mine act of political expression”.
Citizens around the world and high-level politicians, including in the United States, have called the enthusiasm on an uncontrolled system of monitoring as a service of generality.
In his letter Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation, "if the problems about humanitarian situation have been solved".
Frontier Airlines raises fees for hand bags
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to take hand bags on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand bags and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade, even if in the announcement was read on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole dose.
The new fee applies to baggage in the bag box above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that if the fee was paid in advance, you were paying 25 US dollars and 100 US dollars for travelers who were only paying at the flight level.
Frontier-speaker Kate O'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars aimed to move travelers to care for payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines began in 2008 to request fees for the first and second deposited baggage.
Passengers who tried to cope with these have therefore stopped as much as possible into hand bags as the result of the frequent overfilled bags over the seat.
fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money.
It's about the most faithful customers of Frontier who had clearly expressed that it's going to be more difficult to find room in the field over the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not need to pay.
This means that a passenger at frontier's flight may take a baggage free of charge, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable baggage.
O'Malley explained that the frontier website and the check-in processes would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they get to the flight.
The new frontier hand bag fee only enters into force in summer, a exact date is not yet available.
Passengers often cheat on luggage and other fees, but airlines are pleased to fall back on it.
They argue that the transport of baggage should pay money and passengers this service if they wish him.
Many on Wall Street consider the new luggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flight travel after years of loss.
Most of them, however, leave the fingers of fees for hand bags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as first fees for handbags and later Allegiant Air followed, also a billy flyer.
The only other airline company with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, declared the Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who monitors the additional fees carefully.
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the Handbage fee of Spirit brings $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who once had a lead position in midwest Airlines, has recently fled with spirit and was curious what would expect him at the flight if passengers were faced with the unusual hand bag fee of the company.
“The boarding process was one of the most smooth that I have experienced in my aviation career," he said.
I expected to see teeth knees and hand-made discussions at the flight stage.
“The plane was full,” he said, “and the boarding run like smelled.”
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars demanded for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice would keep all the dosage and be filled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had attempted short-term requests for refrigeration drinking money in 2008, but seven months later, after passengers had detrimented and no other large society was attracted.
Frontiers Step to raise fees for handbags if passengers do not buy directly at the airline, the latest initiative is to guide customers to their own website.
Pay airlines online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per sale ticket.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to direct purchase with them instead of via an online travel office.
Frontier, however, has gone the most widely in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half so many vibrant miles in booking over an online travel office.
On Wednesday, the miles were shortened to 25 percent of the flight track.
A trip with Frontier booked for a third party with a frontier over 1000 miles therefore only brings 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve places on the Frontier website exclusively when buying directly.
Frontier has a faithful customer tribe at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The loss decreased by 9 percent, and the air capacity shrinked almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Mother Group, Republic of Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to handle the Frontier's finances in the context of sales of society.
Speaking words come from the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last woman's freight piece of this year in the evangelical church congregation Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipal house was "speaking words from the Bible" and "re-uses from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the Church Congregation Council, entered the Bible’s words after breakfast.
"Speaking words contain life proofs, regulations or warnings," she explained.
It compared several words with the corresponding Bible points and explained the meaning.
She called spells like: "Have awake, as shoes fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone who gives it to the Lord in sleep, washing his hands into innocentness.
At several times, the referendum also advised her listeners to what word it was.
The use of talks from the Middle Ages took up the church community Christel Dehner: All good things are three, making blue, shooting something.
It explained importance and origin of the talks they called "bridges in the past".
A Tombola was released at the end.
The prices were covered on a table and were humbled before they were transferred to the winners.
Among the visitors of the round of breakfast, the burger also missed Roman Waiseegger.
Learning instead of workless: pilot project for inexperienced in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was started at the Mecklenburgn lake.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as an instructor in the industry will be qualified over three winters to specialists for hotels and restaurants.
"Newly, it is that the six months old courses end with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert from the work agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are varied: participants would not be unemployed in this way, and the company would commit trained professionals who were increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency should not finance unemployment.
The project also involves the industrial and commercial chamber in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that an internal error and not hacker were guilty on the crash of the website
The estimated National Security Agency stated late Friday, a mistake made its public website a few hours and not hackers as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not accessible for a few hours this night, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explains the spionage agency in an e-mail sent message.
The problem will be solved this night.
The claim that the failure has been caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS), is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers were noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that for some users it is not yet.
Before that, a NSA speaker had declared ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority is “in no way” compromitted.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least a group of hacktivists used to have lahmed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target web site is flooded with page calls until the server is overloaded and the website is collapsed.
Cybertactics is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to impose into the internal network of the target system.
The former super secret NSA, whose nickname was one of No Search Agency (no such authority), is now in the light of the public and looks at the enthusiasms known in recent months about its extended monitoring programme in the interior and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data that was stolen and published by the degraded former NSA employees Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the secret service fired initial speculations on the fact that the incident is today the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without job in October is probably dropped by 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota was better than last year and better than in September, "we hoped more," says Monika Field-Bauer, deputy director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Because many companies responded to settings until now.
A reason for this is according to field farmer: "We have little specialists in handicraft, health and old care."
Yearly bidding has also been re-establishing job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry since September.
In the middle of December, the winter season begins there.
The whole background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Incurred profits in Bombardier after decline in delivery payments and contracts
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-procent decline in net profit after he was pressured by decreasing orders and deliverys in the third quarter of airplanes and contract problems in the railway savings.
Bombardier, seated in Montreal, also did not publish any flight test data for his brand new CSerries aircraft and did not give new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable in September next.
At the virtue flight of the test aircraft a half months ago, only three further starts followed, as it appears, whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course of over eight percent in Toronto's stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, Analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced its evaluation of "outperform" to "sector" on Thursday in order to ensure that the share has a limited course potential in the next one to two quarters.
“While weaker delivery numbers were expected widely for aircraft, but from the marine development in the transport sector we are clearly disappointed," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries when the plane test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more creative to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries planes can catapulate the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented in March and flog after monetary delays first in September.
However, the CSerries' contractual orders are 177 moderate, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the claims of the company relating to fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new air traffic aircraft are applicable.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin is confident that bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The management of the company assured analytics and media on Thursday, the programme was in the deadline plan.
“The pilot has not been left on the ground more than expected,” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added, while the time of the aircraft was set up soil tests and software updates.
Every manufacturer plants differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then mount a review period of what we have done.
This happens during the entire flight programme.
The second of five pilots is expected to start in the next weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, it was from the company side.
Nevertheless, analytics remain skeptical, whether 12 months after the virgin flight of the first customer can take an airplane of the CSerries.
Bombardier explained that it will verify the planning for the operation (EIS) and update it in the next months.
“The slow advance of the flight test – even if it clearly meets Bombardiers internal planning – strengthens our view that the operation is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter by the end of September 30, bombardiers fell net profits to $147 million and $8 Cent per share of $172 million and $9 Cent per share per year.
The adapted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
The revenue was low and decreased from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analytics expected 10 cents per share and a sales of 4.56 billion dollars, said Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 in last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The stock of orders in the air and space savings was $32.9 billion on September 30,9 billion and was thus changed compared to December 31.
"In the area of air and space, the results were disappointed under our standards, but the low contract entry and market conditions were totally disappointing," said Beaudoin.
The sales in the air and space savings fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway producer, announced that the sales in this saving has increased by about 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The orders in the transport savings amounted to 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September and was slightly increased by 31 December.
The transport profit margin has been affected by development problems in some large contracts.
According to management, there will be new standards for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trading on Thursday, the bombardier-action was 8.5 percent and layed at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after announced that the Google-Financing Board Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturers and bombardiers closest, reported a ten-procent decline in quarter profit on Thursday.

Kokain-dependent lawyer, who warned drug forest against police investigation, must be in prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underground size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug dependence could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A well-known defendant who warned a drug baron from a large police investigation because he feared that his secret drug need could be detected was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided under-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations about its drug trade activities after complicated by his own cocainess.
Criminists as a “first classy” lawyer with the nickname “Bash” was arrested in 2011, after the police had supervised Scarborough, who he had represented in an earlier drug procedure.
Officers observed how Scarborough (32) three bag cokain delivered at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while this was with colleagues at a meal of the lawyer's chamber.
The investigations reported that Ditta regularly used drugs from class A after testing the traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to create unauthorised information on the arrest of two men in order of Scarborough and one of his partners.
At that time, all four suspects were monitored by the police in the context of a large investigation procedure on heroin and cokain trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other persons, they were arrested later after the police made sure that heroin and cokain were worth 1.5 million pounds and 20,000 pounds of cash.
Thista, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could be published.
Today, Thista, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found and condemned at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week procedure in two complaint points because of the disabilities of justice.
He gave the cocaine owner at an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transmitted after the police found in their investigations against Scarborough that it had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two research officials followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and there the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the trash tons of the lawyer.
Soon after he had delivered drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned with Ditta, who was at the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
Before court, it was known that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of Kokain after the tests of the Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Thista was later arrested, but absent to take cocaine and said that he spoke with the discouraged dealer because he was his mandant and claimed that her discussion was subject to the "anwalt secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were assured and a hair sample was taken.
At the police hearing he announced that he would call him at home for legal matters both under his private address and at the workplace, a office and clients.
Before the court, he was known that he had called important actors of drug trade, some of which he had previously represented, after significant arrests and had informed what the mediators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: “A criminal lawyer should know better than all others that the law is not breached.”
Thista is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defendant, as he has left too much with certain clients.
The questionnaire relationship is not simply the one of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these persons.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and mandant.
He tackled the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to comply with their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta put his occupational status into question.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Thista pointed out every disadvantage and claimed: “If I was a corrupt lawyer what I am not, and wanted to pass information to Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but do so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: “Here Ditta has done the step from a criminal to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made it acceptable for the motives of leading members of organized crime, who appointed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Thista has deteriorated this trust and tried to cate behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a condemnation in three cases due to the possession of cokain and justice, which underlined our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning of criminals and shows that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to the court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years of prison after he had declared the conspiracy for heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Five and thirty more involved in drug trade, 'persons were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years because of drug delicates.
On his website, Ditta published a field with questions and answers about himself, in which he said that his dream job was to represent as an advocate mandant in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and chance inequality is the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations from the occasion of his 160-year-old existence, the Songerkranz Dunningen will be transformed with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the Musical "Rock my Life", which excited the viewers in the spring of this year, the song cranz will extend to the end of the Jubilee Year two service services with the creation of the German fair of Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 on the evening fair at the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 p.m. at the St. John Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called German fair with the original title "Sings to the celebration of the sacred victim of the fair", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from the year 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of origin.
The fair is listed in the context of the service of God, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the musikal group Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Hashlage: Creation softens the conviction
With the elections to the parish Council 2015, for example, the Seelsorge unit Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally.
There is only a common parish council for all six pastors then.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach were prepared to change.
Because of the fundamental decisions of the diocese, it is no longer necessary to change and it is to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactory as possible.
During the day it was particularly clear: the creativity toward the Newer is desperate but a conviction.
From the ideas and expectations to the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish Council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelsorge team were enough.
Regional decan Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the newly set directives on seelsorge units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg.
Afterwards, SE Haslach forms a church community in the future a public law body which enters the rights and obligations of the six individual congregations up to now.
There will only be a common parish Council and a Council of Stichting in which the parish force is represented.
Each parish should represent at least two elected members, in which six parishes are formed locally so-called municipal teams.
Their task will be to promote the religious life in the place.
In the question of the financial of the individual parish, there was a significant need for discussion.
The innovations provide that collected goods remain connected in the pastors.
The obligations shall, however, go to the general general.
With regard to the large investments planned, whose commitment to all pastors was then made, there were great concerns.
"In the past, only projects could be invested alone by the individual priests," has been relatively governed Haslach's parish chairman Bruno Princebach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five pastors painted Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the Seelsorge Unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had been responsible in 2006, "one becomes one, staying five" and had to find that this is not so easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelorge Unit then answered the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish Council and the practical work of the municipal teams.
The preparations will be concreted at further meetings and decided at another meeting of all six bodies next spring.
At the end, the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seelsorge Unit, which was agreed with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, the current becomes expensive
Citizens Pfullendorfs have to set themselves on higher cost of electricity.
As the director of the cityworks, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against SÜDKURIER, arrives at a four-speaky Pfullendorfer family 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC environment from 5.277 to 6.3 cent per kilowatt hour.
This sales will be re-established every year in October by the four operators of the large power rates.
These are the additional costs they generate from the energy-consuming costs which they can raise through a salary over the electricity price.
The townworks Pfullendorf form the last member in this chain.
In his forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Companies even came out of higher sales as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.
Now the concrete payments should be calculated before the cityworks could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We go out of an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number will be more close to the 2 cents.
Ampel on permanent red: Keep on waiting time
Sometimes, an ampel just doesn't become green.
The carrier in the street does not react, or the light mark is broken.
What are you going to do?
When a person waited for long enough on a red ampel and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the journal "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "angemets" which may be interpreted different from the case.
Becker advises to persist at least five minutes before the abnormality of the ample is assumed.
Those who continue the journey despite red lights must be clear, however, that he has to be fully guilty for an accident caused by this.
Those who wait less than five minutes, may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes, a driver had ignored the ampel and had to be responsible for a driving red light infringement.
The ampel was not broken, but little later surrounded to green.
A driving ban left him because of the particular situation - but not the financial penalty.
Congregation Council welcomes solid budget
When it comes to the budget at municipal council sessions, Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well.
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has been no longer known since 2005.
In this sense, the financial year 2012 can also be made full of success.
This was clear in the idea of the 2012 annual accounting.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was over EUR 7,6 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also about EUR 1,8 million above the approach.
The surplus is particularly higher commercial tax revenue and the share of the Community in income tax.
The assets budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the 1.5 million euros planned, it was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially the higher introduction from the administrative budget", says Rothmund.
As less investment has been done than planned in the financial year 2012, deposits have also increased.
Overall, the overall deposit could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked for the good work at Rothmund and her team.
"So a work is not just shaking out of the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual account.
He and the municipal councils looked forward to the good numbers.
It may sound paradox, but just these good numbers could soon come to be more expensive.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality in the past was able to disregard high portions.
However, according to Gerster, the country has often shortened grants.
For these grants from various compensation blocks there are conditions.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities, which apply grants, must present certain sets.
"The theme of Heberates must be seen as investments for which we would like to grants are in the coming years," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
At 60 years of singer, Hubert Wermter's history is nearly twice twice as long as the feast of herbs, in which he was honored celebrity.
Hubert Wermter stood like living in the colors of his men's association on the stage.
Even after 60 years of singing, the chor still makes him great fun with the now more than loved choir.
In the association, Wermter was also active, including 28 years' member of the Committee.
For his commitment and his association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoralreferent on behalf of the Rottenburg-Stuttgart Confederation, communicated him - as the choir is also a church chor - a document of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singers gave him the doctrine of the German choir association as well as a graved cinnteller.
In addition to the honor, the 31th autumn feast was in habitats: With the MGV Betra, the song crane of Salzstetten, the singer department of Baisingen and the local music association, the Fullmaringer had a colorful mixture of various choors and vocal styles that were held by around 400 visitors.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with agreeable songs such as "In the wineparadies" and "Lustig, their brothers".
Her Honor Hubert Wermter prepared them for honor yet a small town - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts "Bundeslied".
The men's singer Betra also sang classic chor leaders like "Judgery" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the "When you're going through the valley".
The song's cranz Salzstetten provided the women's rate of festival with his mixed choir and his group of women - the "Impulschor".
The mixed choir was released by the Napolanian national way "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also revoked foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude".
The singer department of the Baisinger Sports Verein came back with "What's the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" into genuss, where the Fullmaringer Music Association offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small native program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer brought up a cassette theatre and read a few stories that the children spent the afternoon.

Kenyan Press is embarrassed by controversial media law
"We are in a terrible situation, and we may ask ourselves, what does the Parliament abstain from making just the judicial independence tomorrow?", was the newspaper which is considered in the draft law that is not constitutional.
“The law is draconically and very punishing, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, head of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most respective independent radio stations and news sites of Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be prevailed because it is a prolonged government arm," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and return to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government took the new law "the media effectively into a vengeance". On the other hand, The Standard, Democracy and Redemption in Kenya would have suffered "a heavy strike" and called the design as "draconic".
The adoption of the law belongs to a number of measures to strengthen national security in the deterioration of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media moved the wrath of the authorities because they published records of security cameras that were to see how the units sent to the Tatort supposedly extinguish the luxurious shopping center.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded to hearing two journalists and a leading media representative even if the charge was withdrawn after a recording of the media.
According to the new law, media houses may be occupied with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenya Shilling and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or exempting from an official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to contest the possession of those concerned if a penal is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “has a single penalty can impose the majority of radio broadcasters in the bank redt”.
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating impact on what their description according to the "lifeful blogosphere" of Kenya could have.
If they breached the media for silence, politicians could unpunished do what they want.
“No one will ever experience it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at the nation, who described the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“You leave politicians yourself, they lead the country into the bankrott and back to the time of the hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan Lawyers have already moved to public trouble in the past.
In May they agreed to re-establish the reductions arranged by the national remuneration Commission and resume their deficiency holders of about 532,000 shills per month – they are among the highest worldwide.
Bad Duurrheim: A dream will be true for the FC
On the importance of the city and soccer club, the official institutional celebration for the art racial sports site despite the cold whiteness and rain.
A more pleasant celebration hour last Saturday probably wanted to all, but Peter did not want to play with it.
So all those who had the suspicion that came without rainscreen or couldn't hold such one for some reason.
This went to the musicians who marched the festival, as did some speaker.
As a result, the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks was given to all the pre-burger Walter Klumpp, who has been strongly engaged in the implementation of the project, to the Council of the Community, to the undertakings and association members involved.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rest of the pensioners deposited 400 square meters of plaster stones for the new roads.
This remarkable honorary commitment also valued the country's deputy Karl Rombach.
Other greeting words were spoken for the Municipal Sports Committee Hubert Manyr, the District Chair of the South Bathian Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp reminded that in the spring and autumn it was always returning to the original racial site that he could not be played.
For 15 years ago, the first reason to solve the problem was thought of the construction of a third place at the ground of the football club or at the real school at the Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came to be found in an art racial sports site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plannings were taken two years ago, when the FC took over the cable slots in herbacht, attributed a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the Council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of 560 000 euros.
The construction start of the 68 times 108 meters of large art rass was held on 4 June.
During the more than three months of construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of the earth were deducted, from which half was used for the construction of a dirt bike track.
Union and SPD continued their coalition negotiations with the internal and judicial issues.
The competent working group came together in Berlin on the morning.
Among other things, direct democracy, Parliament's occupation and the Federal Police.
On the morning, the Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions.
This would include double citizenship, both sides have contradictive ideas.
The SPD wishes to end the force for immigrant children born in Germany to decide – the Union refuses a double pass.
On the subject of traffic, which is not at the meeting order on this Friday, the SPD undermined her no to one of the CSU demanded cars.
A Vignette is a "flatrate for vibration and thus eco-productive," said the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
It threatened return transport on roads that are already accidental points.
The introduction of a wall for all cars would also be a first step from the view of Pronolds.
"It is the danger that the compensation for Germans is deleted at a later time," he said.

Vienna Airport creates passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
By way of this, there will be no more time at the Vienna Swechat airport.
A large part of the loud speaker throughsights falls away - the noise level is to be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As the airport spouse Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, the Airport Vienna follows a international trend with the attitude of doorsags affecting individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already departing to the warming calls.
By the loss of these doors - average, around 200 personal calls by the loud speakers on a day - it is to be more quiet at the airport.
"It has also shown in the experience that these individual passages were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information on modified flight climbs or departure times are undergoing here," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio sender.

Melk and Ei-Alternatives overview
Vegan nutrition requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
For example, Pürated Tofu with plant sensation is a quarker set.
The Vegetarian Federation also calls on the World Vegetarian Day on November 1st.
The Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives on the first November:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, let Joghurt replace with Sojajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, hafer, mandle or rice milk can be used.
Consequent plant seats are replaced by conventional snails.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half-tracked mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apples or a meal of meal-mailed leain seeds plus three donkey waters are suitable for this.
Locker becomes tea instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of backpoiler, a meal of food strength and three apples of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of Sojajoghurt or Seidentofu can fulfil this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800 000 people are currently feeding vegans in Germany, so purely plantic.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their guest families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Blackwald Guimnasium learned the American Great City of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, which was reached at foot the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here there was a fascinating view of the world-known Skyline, which makes a special ride in the evening light.
Due to time, the students were almost 24 hours on the legs, but faithful to the motto "Do not sleep" was decided the day at the Times Square.
Despite Shutdown the second day, the status of freedom could be reached with a ferry and at the foot.
Afterwards, it was about the Wall Street's financial centre to the Memorial of September 11th.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city of the 373 meters of the Empire State Building.
After that, through the hectic breibing of the New York streets, it went across the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students now arrived in their guest families and experience the school all day at the Weymouth High School.
This year also, on the name day of the Holy Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsberg Street, a Hubertus fair will be delebrated.
St. Hubertus was the Sage after a quite unrevisitable hunter, who was appointed by a vision and later appointed to the Bishop of Kleinich.
The hunting horn blast group of the hunting riders Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musized on perforcers (Nature listeners in the mood Es) to old, original French melodies.
The blasts wear ridiculous clothing because they accompany most of the riders, horses and dogs on sleppy yachts musical.
The celebration fair will be held on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 p.m.
The redesigned repositorial smiles with a new cafe.
One that invites to dwell and come back.
One that wants to make the name for the program.
According to Lexikon, as Déjà Vu, you are called a psychological phenomenon expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the event of visiting the coefficient café at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in a glance to the University of Rhein-Waal, it must not remain in the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly the goal: to make a real stay not only thankful, but to make hand firm always reflecting.
Because it's just doing fun and it's just beautiful.
A glance in the inner life on the top 8 gives the viewer a good feeling for Anhieb.
The high-modern but not cool café ambiente looks like a place for well-being.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner was at the top the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
This gives it the delicious cake or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The holders, both 33 years old, have already made a name before opening the smiling café on the site as gastronomics: In Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve on the site, the sympathic café lovers hope more public.
Not least also by university.
"Where we have no specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students in this area want to respond to the same as those of the Senioren and all age classes.
Apropos Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathy pair of holders stand behind the coffee genus.
Enjoy the fragile hot bore in the most varied variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso-Fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino-Trinkerin.
"To that's a gunette - that's my thing," she says the NRZ.
Two events also gave it in the bright café.
That's better one.
Because the harbor festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
The two 33-year-olds found "shine, successful and funny."
But just not everybody's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a express fan of event evening: "You can't make it all right now."
And with an event, I always speak only to those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the quite normal operation as little as possible."
It should be said: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
As regards the quality of the products that are offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment on the site in Kleve.
The street, which develops more and more into a gastronomy miles.
To enjoy many clever, guests from close and away and the students discovering Gastromeiles and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks to the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Denker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wife were happy to come.
In the club place of the "Witteborg" in Dinker, all of them enjoyed the harmonious fellowship in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate festival in order to take honors.
This time writer Rolf Wagener welcomed the special award "Sängers of the Year".
"You have not only written much for us, but also turned some rounds for us, for our warm thanks," says the president of the Chores Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir samples by activity skirts went to the Chorleiter Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the honourable Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "Songer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants.
Place five occupied novel Artur Brückner.
A particularly thanks to the board addressed the team of Vereinswirtin An Pier-Ribbert, who once more had a menu of the extra class, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets his regular choir samples always on Tuesday at 19.45 p.m. in the club hall.
"New singing voices are welcome to us at any time," says Schlotmann.
UN explains new objectives for poverty control
The United Nations starts immediately with the preparation of a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction.
In the front of the UN Initiative for Sustainable Development, which started in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the prevention of ‘suppressive Development Goals’ to replace the Millennium Goals out of 2015.
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world-political leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Mon, on the evening, stated at the summit that the date had come to "despite national interests".
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to attack a process that should be agreed with universal, sustainable development objectives," he said.
“These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral component of the framework for development after 2015.
I will not be able to implement this mandate provided by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the Handball Superligist continues to be good voting.
There's no doubt about that trainer Tomasz Malmon.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope we will finally win again.
"When I don't know any more like a victory," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the thirdiga reserve from Fredenbeck has currently missed out of trees, Malmon has warned the shower in the front.
Many players I have trained myself in the A youth.
They will therefore be particularly motivated against their ex coach.
"In addition, it is waiting if there is still strengthening from the first," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team must increase in any case in comparison with the past performances.
Before all things in the coverage work and during the shift game, it was most powerful.
It is also necessary to improve opportunities.
That's why I hope my players have finally got their head free during the short break.
Security thinking in Mozambique grows in the light of collapses between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered together in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of Samora Machel Statue, the state founder and the first president of Mozambique to agree to a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
From the fear of the country's future, she has exchanged its business clothing against a T-shirt with the heading ‘We call security’ to Portuguese and joined the amount on the capital's independence on Thursday.
For two weeks there are almost daily reports on collapses between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an intimidated rebel movement, which initially supported by the White Government and later the Diparty Government of South Africa in order to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country relapse into an adult conflict, but the latest events of foreign investors and locals have disturbed.
For the rapidly growing economy, the discovery of enormous gas stocks from the coast and coal camps in the north-west could bring investments from over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States to the country.
The prevailing Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the latest collapses by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos.
The violations on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo support points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos speaker to the Financial Times.
The government blame Renamo for the collapse and accuses the organization to attack soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about instability.
On Wednesday, the French news agency, he said that Dhlakama is considered to be a losser who “will use all its remaining forces in order to prove that he can force the government’s decisions.
Both Frelimo and Renamo show that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement.
In contrast to the FT, he stated that Frelimo did not respect the agreement anymore.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," said Mazanga.
Earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to the addition of tensions that have been fired by a number of collapses this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who collapse the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, a teacher at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
No one of them is good to negotiate and no one is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who urges election reforms, has already explained that she will take up the local elections in November.
Presidential and Parliament elections are planned for the next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a crowning movement to develop concessions and financial beneficiaries from the government.
Renamos elections have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member democratico de Moçambique (MDM), will probably improve the elections.
Mazanga claims Guebuza’s return to his second term of office in the next year to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the Presidential office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has taken some attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most fighters took place in the province of Sofala, located some hundred miles north of Maputo, but Beira is located, port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga answered back to the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted “the international community to warn that things in Mozambique are not good” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already cared for corruption, the slepping progress in development and a recent release wave.
"The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions for the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrant, said that people just wanted to make stability.
“Not interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to be peaceful and useful streets again," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “examples for life” means a author.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal power does not have a chance against clever tricks” and the artus lying demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths are, however, “in many cases too wild, too tedious, and in some cases to be taught in schools,” why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a “sorgful selection” of old-right works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that the authors and teachers who were “transparent didactically” would put children off "completely", because the messages would be "subsistant" in conversation.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Angel Saxon and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: “You can follow certain intentions, but you should keep them as far as possible.”
The most likely difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and a author who writes for children is in the need to convey hope.
Not everything must be simplified or lead to happy end, but there is an immensary sense of good and evil.
This must be discreet, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of story.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took up his retirement seat in Haslach, on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many viewers were excited by the very short-term scene game.

Silently, he had the two-speaker and "Swimmer Füchsen" of Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received from the audience with a lot of applauses, even his sister Philippine was welcome.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incrediblely good to put in the role of the sister and loved her in Mimik and Getic's life unhappy.
Between each game scene, Mühlenbach's farm chapel played appropriately selected musical pieces and rounded off the performance.
In order to grant the dignity of honorary citizens, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler was the honor, who, together with part of the Council, made his expectation in the representation of the then officer.
Their expectation then made the three royal singers who called Hansjakob to the call: "Ask as beautiful, there will be young remembrances of my own three-monetary time alive."
With her song "O Jesuslein" they enjoyed the audience in the outdoor court as well as the Storchentags' children with their loud "Here, Aus".
His criticism at the Office Church had expressed Hansjakob at that time as his concerns about the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war.
In the home, behind his grave chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"An unruhful spirit had finally found his peace and was gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene game.
Viel Applaus and many praised words were from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Riesen grows
The chances of the Liga stay of the sports rising Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballer have risen.
Because there should be a wild card procedure, then there's less for the Neckar Riesen.
The Basquetball project Hamburg Towers fails to apply for a possible retreat.
"We are not going to participate in the wildcard process," said Ex-National player Pascal Roller, who has created the concept of a professional in Hansestadt since 2012.

He also put in the open dialogue with the neighbors in the future.
Because Matthias Schrell has some more in front of the location.
With the expansion of the Niedersachsen bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to set the coal import for power plants and is on this sector one of the Great in Europe.
Thanks to the deepened Liegewane form of terminal, Capesize builder can also be done here.
"In this year we want to knack the 3-million-tone brand," Schrell says.
In addition to the Eon power plant, the import coal goes to power plants in the domestic country.
If the GDF-Suez power plant continues to go to the network, 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayerns Basketballer Despite first precipitation optimistic
Even the first precipitation in the Euroleague was not able to shake the enormous optimism in the basketballs of the FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to gain against the best team of Europe in the past two years," bilansed Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unhappy 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the title-defense of Olympic Piräus.
We sent the message: there is also basketball in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European King Class, the Munichs sold very well for a long time, but they were simply not clarified enough in the crucial phases.
At first, the guests created the piece of art to transform a 15-point retreat 13 minutes before the end, before piräus gave the game again a turn.
"We have fought incrediblely back against the two-time Euroleague Champion, but then again made delightful mistakes," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win each game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful yards of the Munichs who had celebrated significant victory in the first two parties against the Italian Seriesmeister Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title leader Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You might say that New York City is the birth place of Stand-up Comedy in America: a few hundred years ago, the variation artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre at Broadway, so that the amount of direct widow began to be told in the form of a conversation.
During the years, Fay's innovation was developed, as last at the New York Comedy Festival.
In life, Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, celebrates the festival this year his ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headlines started with Carolines and then became more successful until they were sometime too familiar to enter a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival to continue working with them.
At this year's event, there are appearances from Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy beef event for Armeveteranes in the Madison Square Garden, with among others Bruce Springstone, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has also grown the world of Comedy.
A series of comedians who participate in the festival have become known over rather unconventional ways, such as missions on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a Sitcom in cable TV (the iron-sleeved Fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has its own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a part of the occupation at “Saturday Night Live” as well as in “Parks and Recreation”, although she is best known for her viral video series “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, concentrated on race themes W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of the American Comedy.
Among the largest visitors'magnetes of the festival, an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a viewed television and film director as well as an inofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television broadcast entitled “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the town hall in Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in Larry's whole work in the Comedy DNS," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, he sometimes passes through the gas between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose my whole money, I may live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
The Iran is a week before the next Atomic Meeting with the five UN veterinarians and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, you have a agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences in the last years," said Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way, but the nuclear head dealer was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides come to a solution at the end.
Drama in Uruguay: boys kill game comrades with makeete
Two children have given the murder of a 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys invited their victims to go with them on bird hungd.
With measuring and measuring, they armed the 11-year-olds on Tuesday and washed the body into a fountain, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they had played before their apartments in a worker-viertel football.
The Leichnam was found in the village of Cerro Pelado in the next night, 15 km north of the exclusive beach location Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five - year - old half-switzer of the disciple they had taken, it should say that they were sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the act without mention of an attack against them before the police, the two boys admitted the preliminary killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder, among other things, called a reality in the football game.
He was provisionally delivered into a psychiatric youth event.
Holder must go to prison
The Constanz Landgericht has condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years liability because of exploitable human trade, adherence, threat, damaging and dangerous injuries.
The former Bundeswehrsoldate, which worked after two revenues in Afghanistan as a door steher, was awarded in the framework of a process speech.
So in five cases, he learned women about internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the line after a few weeks against their will.
Againststand, he kept breaking with violence and threats.
The intake of women who had created him for some years remained.
By confiscation of mobiles and SIM cards, he subjects contacts with women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who gave the women, he brought them to various boardelles in the Southwest.
There he gave them partly to control their revenue.
Before the court, the accused first claimed that he suffered under a serious dream, after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed by an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert doubts about psychological restriction and thus on a limited guilt, the 33-year-old acknowledged a comprehensive consent.
The court had not to take any of the damaged women anymore.
According to a Kripo officer, after an first display by telephone monitoring measures, at least four further cases of exploitable human trafficking could be determined.
The absent conversations were characterized by high aggression.
In later mergers, the damaged would have confirmed their martyrium.
Another Witness where one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the whole body did not make any statement until today.
It is "a completely broken personality", which sees violence and exploitation in this meter as normal.
The accused regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has dissolved from these circles and wanted to lead a very normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil price continues to be up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price has also fallen on Friday after the concerns about a high offer exceeded a report that increases China's energy-giving production sector.
The reference troops for deliveries in December had fallen in the electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange on 96.24 USD per barrel during the late morning.
The contract fell by 39 Cent on Thursday, which meant a price loss of 5.8 per cent in October.
The large raw oil offer has last weeks charged the prices.
The United States Energy Ministry stated on Wednesday that the US bid has increased by 4.1 million barrel last week.
During five weeks the offer had risen by 25 million barloons.
But on Friday there were evidence of stronger demand by two reports on activity growth in Chinese production.
This indicates a continuing recovery of China's economy, whose growth has risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it has been at the lowest level for two decades.
Raw oil by the series Brent, a reference value for international raw oil, which is also used by US-American Raffinanies, fell at ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court blocked decision on the NYPD stop andFrisk Directive
On Thursday a Federal Board of Appeal in the United States blocked the arrangement of a judge who had requested changes to the Stop-and-Frisk programme (‘Singles and Browses’) of the New York police department and disbanded the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. appeal court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a calling of the city was decided.
The judge had judged in August, the city violated the constitution with the way in which the program was implemented for the maintenance and question of persons.
The city submitted a call against its assessment and the arrangements for assistance, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to support the police when amending its Directive and the appropriate training programme.
On Tuesday the appeal court heard the arguments to the required suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge must be disconnected from the case, as it had injured the Code of Conduct for US-American Judges by determining that a Judge should avoid the claim of partyity; this was partially founded with a number of media interviews and public statements in which it was publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged, police officers injured the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were in an inadequate way targeted by black and late-in-American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program with the body-driven cameras in quarters in which most controls were carried out.
In August, New York City was ready to stop the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released again after control by the police.
A oral hearing on the calling of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-Frisk practice was criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
The controls of this kind have been in different forms since decades, but the number of recorded controls increased during the term of office of the party-less mayor Michael Bloomberg on a daily height of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities submitted complaints developed to a collective complaint.
Representatives of changes to the Stop-and-Frisk programme of the NYPD say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and more effective police and influence the way in which other police presidents use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would force the morality of the police, but not criminality; also, money would mislead and not solve the broader problem of a police who has been pressured by thousands of jobs in recent decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-Frisk practice, which is constitutional, but just reform the type of implementation of controls by NYPD.
From lucky of dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that can only achieve dreaming camels
With this darkness, the first president Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Healing Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already show respectable successes.
The first president Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in 2004 in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed-Crankenhaus in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation was developed, and the Gynecologe Henne took place on several journeys.
During the speech, images were shown by the inserts on a large canvas so that the guests of the journal event could make themselves an image of the actions mentioned.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to grant this vehicle with a photovoltaic plant and now, according to Henne, plan to work in advisory function at the association.
In 2008, the roomsei Schleeh from many sources in the record time of almost one week created the health station in Socogim, a eldest district on the edge of the capital.
Heenne also mentioned a new mother-klind hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times where in Nagold the birth clinic is to be eliminated.
You learn much in Africa as a medical, says Henne, such as disclosure against Burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, you could not take as many travels as planned, but for this many medicines came to Germany to hospit here in various areas.
In addition, containers are regularly sent to Africa with material, i.e. medical devices, medicines, association material, hospital beds and brilles in March.
Withinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered local colorit by telling from Mauretanians of the mobile set of boilers and painting the experiences of the tribal musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritanian trip.
As his personal reasons, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When he became aware of how much money was lost, he decided to help the Africans in controlling a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some thoughts.
It was not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson inserted telephone hacking for checking a hint
The former news of the Word-Heresteller Andy Coulson was supposed to have "Telefon-Hacking, Monitoring and Confrontation" in trying to confirm a false tip about the affair of the then interior Charles Clarke.
State lawyer Andrew Edis QC declared the court in Old Bailey, News of the World had heard in May 2005 a false smell that Clarke had a relationship with his “attraactive special consultant” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voice mails and persecuted them, but Coulson also called her and left news as the court learned.
“Since the prosecution of the State, Coulson, who is now a publisher of the emergency, no one who stands before the apartment of people and hopes to get it on fresh deed, but one who likes to face people with a history to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three methods to research stories: telephone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
It is obvious that he knows of the second, the monitoring, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He contradicts this, but we say, “And whether he knew about it.”
Sufficients about an affair Clarkes were first attacked by NotW's feature reaction when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Don't shave your time, she's with Charles together.”
A band with voice mails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The median also found entries on the computer of the detective, on which Pawlby and their sister were saved as “projects”.
In the time when the researchers ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Underground, the former head reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice mail with the following contents: “I have a story that we would like to bring out tomorrow about what I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as the former Minister of Interior David Blunkett.
The sworens heard on Thursday that Coulson was confronted with a married woman because of a affair, when he was liable to the Rebekah Rebekah Brooks, who was married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks are fighting to have sworn with others, hacking phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned rich tax, the French Fussball is actually going through the first strike since 1972.
A satisfaction meeting will end unfortunately.
In conflict with rich taxes, the government and the professional football in France have been freed into a sackgasse after a failure.
President François Hollande received a request on Thursday at the Paris Élysée Palace Association and Association Representatives and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to dismiss the fussball from the planned 75-procent tax on incomes of more than one million euros per year, which all national companies should pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hearty.
The strike announced for the end of November will also be carried through, and the Chief Association of the Proficlubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, participated.
The play days set between 29 November and 2 December in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are thus exposed.
Trips: No absolute protection possible
"We want to introduce the inhabitants early in the planning," Jens Haußler opened the civil information event for the highwater protection concept in Gechingen.
Approximately 80 participants came to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to include ideas.
Haußler made it clear: "The last decisions fall the members of the Council of the municipality."
The high water, which chewing on May 15, 2009, was unprepared, was an inventory event that cast up the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler says.
A river area investigation was taken with the Neighbourhood of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the highwater protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many lands as possible is the target," says Häußler.
As a result, the planning of protection from a German weather service is statistically awaiting high water every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15-procent increase.
In Fachkreisen this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses which had led in 2009 to significant damages were a 1000-year-old highwater.
"A absolute protection does not exist, but we can achieve a relative improvement," Häußler says.
In order to protect HQ 100aKlima must be invested around four million euros in Chechen, while the municipality is able to calculate about 70% of its national grants.
However, hauzers pointed out that it was only if a overall concept is implemented.
In this respect, the municipality should be assigned to the participation of the citizens.
A upcoming planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protective concept that has been presented in the municipal council in the past week (we reported) local measures in the flow of the river Irm from the tribal home valley.
Following the presentation of the highwater protection concept, the participants used the opportunity to bring their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no longer drums and retainers were planned for the protection of the place.
Gregor Kühn, professional planner of the Representative Engineering Office Forest and Corbe from Hillsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the merger of all the measures proposed to achieve the desired target in the sum.
In addition, the most economical solution should be found, says Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Unmut was in the old town's lievers, who, even in normal desert rains, have always suffered under an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known for the administration and first measures have already been taken.
However, hauzers pointed out that the directives for channel systems are different than those for the protection of highwater and this are not mixed.
The community is obliged to interpret the channel network so that two to three years of rain events could be raped.
The wastewater channels are greater to dimension, millions would swallow.
Serious infects after collapse
On the early Friday afternoon, on the Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf, two car drivers have been severely injured at a frontal collapse.
The police locked the street completely, but could at first not say little to the accident.
However, there are different testimony to be evaluated only.
It is established that the 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW Golf went towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came against her with his hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed together, while the woman was so heavyly clothed that the fire fire was almost half an hour to free them from the vehicle.
The real accident cause remained unclear at first.
Both unfortunates arrived in nearby hospitals.
The route remained about two hours fully locked.
You could call him the U.S. Dostojewski.
Philip K. Dick was a godly seeker, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serious.
Relaxing the relationship in the outer: the stechnating eyes, the bart, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski, with its massive oeuvre, is to understand as a founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick reads as American prophets who are quite considered something in their own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories represents two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the empire of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with Paranoia, security guards and the faith to be chosen.
Dick had godly experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs put up his brain.
He's inclined, early that the computer's divinities are.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person is different from a machine, the Creator of his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directories such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minderities-Report" is from 1956, flowing the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
It is developed here the principle of the "Privacy crime", "Privacy criminal", so what is now more or less official doctor of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is the terrible one of our, Mutants look at the future and the police.
"We cover individuals who have violated no law," says the head of the Authority.
"We snatch us before they are able to commit a crime of violence."
And, "In our society there are no suppressors, for this we have a prison camp full of Pesudo criminals". You read time streams.
They assume that slums happen, and that the criminal thought is actually implemented.
Dick's story works like the bluepause for the anti-terror structure and the horrow of the NSA.
Antizipation of the attack: Thus, Obamas also works Drohnen-Phylophie and -praxis.
But Dick's story is not at the end.
The head of the police accused that there is no force division, the military controls everyday life, and what is left from the state.
Then the guard is supervised and transmitted to a future crime.
The system's turning through.
It's perfect, but it lies.
It finds its own conditions.
Take mistakes and sacrifices, not only in purchase, but on it.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick says to come closer to the truth again.
Spencers for Merkel in Russia
Edward Snowden, former US Secret Servicexperte, could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US Army for Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutorship could either ask written questions or take the 30-year-olds personally in Russia, the Interfax Agency reported.
Previously, Hans-Christian Ströbele had met as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affairs yesterday.
NSA experiences strengthen company paranoia because of state surveillance
At an mild day at the end of August, a German police crew deeply floated over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
At the instruction of the Federal Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Office (BVT), of the German Interior Secretary, he should photograph the roof of the US exterior post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of supervisors and the action led to a change in words between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clopper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, resumed in September that the United States did not use opportunities for foreign pionage to “assign the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US-American companies so that they could develop their international competitiveness or gain."
But since Edward Snowden, who became a Whistleblower's one-fold staff, with the publication of his fillhorn to US-American supervisory secrets, European governments and heads of business are no longer sure whether they can take the director at the time.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has pioneered the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and provided data for American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought companies paranoia to a new maximum level because of state surveillance.
The Fass overflowing brought the enthusiasm that Kanzler Angela Merkels was infected phone may have been for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can go to the visual, it is safe that company leaders are potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is think that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Green, President of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT fans in Germany.
German companies believe that the USA now represented a almost as great risk as China when it comes to industrial pionage and data diesel, a survey published by the consultant company EY in July.
However, in the documents sent by Snowden there was no evidence yet that the USA have passed the operational secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concerns that the EU had missing certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce their dependence on the USA.
The companies are skeptical in this respect.
On the Bundestag we were suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
“This does not work,” says Hasso Plattner, President of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you would have a strong European IT industry, you would not have to let them die 20 years ago.
All in Germany is subsidised, from the coal over cars to agriculture.
Everything until the IT market.
However, rich and technical refinements of the US-Spionage authorities detected by the snowdrops have shocked companies that had previously seen the largest spionage risk in China.
At Cloud Computing, a large change will take place, since European managers are now aware that data stored in the USA are subject to the right to that which is potentially dangerous.
According to a survey carried out by Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, after the enthusiasms on US-American data mining activities with prism, about ten percent of the non-USA members plans to use an American supplier.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers who have not yet existed – she is: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that this physically remain in this legal room?"
Many German managers believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they knew, namely that powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be monitored at every price.
There is no surprise that economic pionage takes place.
It's always like that.
"It was a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, President of the Chemistry Company BASF.
The Americans pioneered us at commercial and industrial level, as we do, as it is in national interest to defend our companies.
The management of the company is usually not speaking about the counter-treat measures you have taken, because this offers advantages for attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been bound to take a free USB stick on a fair or an unwacht laptop leave in the hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at Auto Manufacturer Audi, says that it has been the standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting, so that they cannot be used as listeners.
The German BVT advises leaders to use simple prepaid phones when they go on foreign trips because smartphones may be compromitted.
The prepaid phones are thrown away behind them.
However, it is worrying that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain viable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche.
"Clients and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources in order to effectively protect operation secrets from unauthorized access," the BVT warns in a report.
The USA warn their own firms against economic pionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate was organized in February France, Russia and Israel behind China on Rank two of the countries serving economic data of the hacking.
A board member of a German Blue Chip company agreed when it comes to economic spionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French DCRL interior service, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “Science services are very accurate that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, are pioneering their associations."
Hechingen: Messe gives answer to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery that people can do," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding festivals succeeded, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Treatment was important providers around a wedding.

Jewelryless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain made attention to her own offer in the reception.
Who then wants to go with the cabinet for that has your link an offer.
"Buts are also popular for boys' diversity," he says.
Romantics is also asked for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding images.

Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a collapsed ringermat in the tour hall of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the United States of Georgia was found on 11 January in a sincere Matte, which standed behind the Tribone in the school tower hall.
The research officer of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old man doubts.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never believed he died as the Sheriff concluded.
“They believe that it dismisss every logic, violates the laws of physics as well as against healthy human understanding," says Crump.
Rather, they were convinced that the truth will be deceived to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of her son.
"Your son went to school for learning and came back in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. State lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation to death Johnsons, as a number of important questions were still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This explained Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they also lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson died from the consequences of a “position-related dictation”.
However, a second autopsy has caused another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that there is sufficient evidence of criminal or civil law investigation to the death of Johnson, he will commit the FBI with the implementation of the investigations.
A representative of the University of Sheriff was not ready for a comment on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in the southern Georgian ordered that the authorities must release all monitoring videos that the mediators have checked.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped that the video recordings had evidence of how he was died.
Publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of directives on the handling of food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such directives which the U.S. government has issued, as the number of school children with food allergies rise.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The distribution of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent, according to CDC between 1997 and 2007.
The Guidelines contain information for schools that should wake a awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epitephrine predominantly – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – in order to meet potentially deadly hypersensitivity reactions.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the regulations so that schools can keep Epinephrin more predominant.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called by children who show an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels like something's pressed on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it" or "Crimping my tongue."
Parents of intersexual children can choose “indecisively”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognized for children born with unambiguous genitaly.
Newborn is no longer assigned to man or female.
According to the new law, parents do not have to explain sex anymore for such children but can “uncertain” or “not-determined” on birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to take overwhelming decisions relating to surgery for newborns and fight against discrimination of intersexual people.
According to BBC, an intersexual person later said: “I am neither man nor wife.”
I stay the fluctuation created by doctors, abrupt and full of fools.
Estimately one of 2,000 children every year does not come to the world as a boy or as a girl.
They are among the intersexual, a group falling under the diagnosis “sexual diversification disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, ceramedrusses (exual strokes or hounds) or unusually developed genitaly.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. are advised to use the best available information on gender allocation if a determination is not possible and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide for an operation.
The New York Psychiatrist Drescher, who specialised on the problem of gender identification, said the new German law “knowledge after a good thing.”
Intersexual children represent a ethical dilemma.
“Many people have life threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not apply that," he said.
You can make a sex assignment without operation and then wait for how the identity developed.
The scientific data about how a child develops its sexual identity is not very precise.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersexual people should be different from transsexual or transgender personnel, because their status is not gender but due to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics have been shown in prestigious sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stake, priority sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genilicia or chromosom structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of discrimination that is subject to intersexual and transgender personnel in the professional life, as well as of the extent of disadvantage, violence and prejudice crime.
It is now a special camp that does not match the sex image.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate male, female or third sex in official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognised as the first “sexual” person worldwide after a court had allowed the lifelong maintenance of a "undefined" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German evidence will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, i.e. the Interior Ministry.
In the neighboring of France, sex topics are still controversial, says a news message on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “girl theory” from school books.
The US-American Website Catholic Online has also expressed itself against the German law, with the reasoning: “When the world is distorted into a new state where the gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two further pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to baby zone, she finds it better if babies were assigned to a sex during birth.
“The parent is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with male and female sex parts were called Hermaprodites, after the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
For ten years ago, medicine considered the sex to be removed and then rebuilding.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted after now is known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels with the sex assigned by them.
"With the 20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
When such a child was born, you would not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeons.
The magnificent theory about the treatment of children with unambiguous genitaly goes back to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the sex is formable.
He preferred the term “sexual identity” and argumented, social and environmental infringements – such as the parents raise a child – interagreed with the genes and hormones of a child and pretends whether a person considered as male or female.
But in a case known under the title "John/Joan" from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy, whose penis was separated by a prestigious circumcision, to destroy the child as a whole and to remove his hounds and then rear him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but he was not,” says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he returned to male sex and married a woman.
With 38 but he began suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the entry into the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public who are “not happy with the result”.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY-man chromosomes, but two-day genitaly.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “a satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and the hounds were removed surgery shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But when he was depressive and knew that something was wrong, he required his medical acts.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one has ever said this to me.
Bruce was born with a DSD which did not produce enough testosterone for the development of genitaliens.
After he had learned the truth, he changed to the male identity, received testosterone infections and let his breasts be removed.
The operation has become unfruchtable.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the Advocates for Informed Choice legal group in California, ensures that the German law can “repeal and stigmatize”.
“Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to take quick decisions and invoke the child not to be determined” she explained.
We are afraid that the intervention is beneficial.
We think it would be better to attribute the male or female sex and then wait.
However, we do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because “it allows adults to recognise as third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she explained.
The German law concerns the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at that time.
If they are grown, they can decide about their body.
However, Dr Arlene Baratz, a breast radioologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with sexual disruption and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law “perfect” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete Androgen resistance.
Because of the reception order of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but she has no uterus and no egg bags.
Today Katie 29 is married and she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff in the children's psychiatry.
Although it is unfruitable, it hopes that a child can be given by adoption or a body mother.
"The law gives parents room, which does not have to take overlapping decisions," said Baratz.
It provides the time for them to make various tests and clarify things and give them time before they write “manual” or “woman”.
In this way, everything is okay – you draw the child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parents' happiness.
And you don't have to make a surgery that doesn't make anymore.
“This includes the children’s decision and removes the fear that the parents surpass because they feel they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that fits better – and that is wonderful.
This will allow children to make the decision itself.
Unknown injured girl by car shot
Unknown has injured a twelve year in Sachsen-Anhalt when shooting from a car.
The daders probably fired a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin with a air pressure weapon.
This was the police officer in Burg.
The girl had been easily injured on the left wad.
Sales forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car who had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The dadders also shot on a bus stop.
A disc broken.
Then they went away.
The criminal police was determined on Friday.
Until this time, the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called for two times to own children who were warning against house facades.
As home owners recognized this time and the egg retirement were equally removed, no damage would have been created.
In addition, some Sylvester gospelers were also wunded in the city area, but no damage has also been created here.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car had been developed with cliBover and his bicycle mixtures were disposed.
However, until the police arrives, the man found its cyclical mixtures in the immediate vicinity of all, because the police had not to continue to work.
Living with future perspective
In fact, Waltraud lives greatly dreamy.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
There are just a few minutes in the city with public transport.
"They hopefully have no fear of spider?", asks Waltraud Ries and shows a fat spider at the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spiderphobie, but the worry of not to be able to handle the many stairs to the house and in the apartment anymore, she explains.
Additionally, since a meniskus operation, the mid-fiftyer must have experienced on the own body, which means moving with handicap from Stockwerk to Stockwerk.
Recently, a book of her has been published on the topic 'Happy living in age - Which living form is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at age', she starts to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment over 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with mid-fifty, Waltraud Ries differently thinks about it.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are all involved in the topic 'Wohnen in age'.
Most of them are enduring as long as they are.
The old one always gets the others', she says smelling.
Only when the passing pressure is really big, you're thinking.
'Then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presented 17 housing models for self-determined living in the age.
'Whoever a living form you choose is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution is not available for age.
Even those who can make up the retirement seat in Tuscany or the breach should always consider that he can also be sick.
And: 'Our good knowledge of the national language is also united in the Dolce Vita' gives the author to consider extinguishers.
Among their models, classic care models, alternative housing forms, or the often quoted pensioner WG.
In the age, everybody has his ticks and Mackens
"For me would be such a community of dwelling but nothing," she thinks with a eye.
Not even as in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
"In age, you just need its back-up rooms," says Ries.
The fact that a Seniors-Wohn Community can function yet does not want to exclude the accounting author.
But that must go differently than in the classical student WG.
And sometimes you just want only his rest', she believes.
In this opinion, it is not at least alone in the capital of the country.
'Most of old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as they stay in their own apartment', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the leader of the civil service life at the age of the capital of the country.
Your service advises people about the topic 'older becoming'.
For this reason, elderly people would often buy inconveniences and restrictions only to be able to stay in their habitated environment, that is also the experience of the goods test.
Today there are many opportunities to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all who deal with the old-right transformation of their home or apartments should first be fully informed and not ordered to the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for old-right transformation.
Even in the rent apartment, this makes some real, and if it is only the toilet seat, the interior architect is clearing.
But not always, the existing apartment can be transformed from old-right and thus freely, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a staircase lift within the apartment, which would also be a staircase-plate path to the door but that would be much larger obstacle.
She'll look further until she's found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she greys more than before the spin on her apartment door.
U.S.A. wants to continue to pursue punishment
The United States have not changed their position to the former US Secret Service Worker Edward Snowden.
He will continue to prescribe that he has dismissed secret information.
So he had to put himself in the United States a criminal procedure, said the speaker of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements of Snowden would also not change it.
Before, the German Green Polician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the USA after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to threaten him further with punishment.
Psaki stressed that there was a strike statement about the one of Parliamentarians and not about those of a German government member.
Secret Service Exhibition Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This has cleared the former NSA employees looking for by the United States in a not addressed letter, which the Green Polician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed on to Federal Government, Bundestag and General Bundesanwalt.
The letter has the following words:
To the Delegations
I was asked to write you about your study on mass surveillance.
I called Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contractual or direct awarded as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
As a result of my employment in these institutions, I became witness to systematic law infringements of my government which caused me to act from moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself disposed of a serious and persistent estuation that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently exile and enjoying temporary asylum, which grants me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political acts, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officers, including the United States, have assessed the enthusiasms of a system of comprehensive monitoring which no one is accountable as a public service.
These spionage discoveries have moved many proposals to new laws and directives aimed at the misuse of public trust that was previously covered.
The advantages for society from these knowledge gained are increasing; at the same time, the risks taken were significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven positive, my government continues to treat this as a deceptive breakdown and strives to criminalize and disregard political opinion.
Nevertheless, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States will rely on this affordable position by supporting the international community.
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are conveyed, I will be able to participate in the satisfactory enlargement of the issues relating to the statements made in the media, in particular in terms of truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and legally.
I am pleased to talk to you in your country as soon as the situation is clear and thank you for their efforts to maintain the international right that protects us all.

Children's garden has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen' Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the comune to a private person.
The municipal council agreed in his recent meeting in the unpublished public part.
The building changed his owner to a "angemetery" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," said Maier.
The budget was EUR 100 000.
Not yet is clear how the new owner wants to use the former child garden.
The Mayor is right that winters have given responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer have to come up for the entertainment of the house, how to heal, look at the garden and reach the walk.
"This effort is now away," says Maier.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The Hammereisenbach Music Verein gives a place concert on the terrace of the Hammer Gasthaus.
When Dirigentin Bianca Willmann has the taktstock at 19.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the musician sounds of Hammrich.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the musical pieces.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped to manage the first musical hook successfully in this context.
Report: Obama campaign planned to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors of President Barack Obama have conveyed in the secret to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the election campaign in 2012 by Hillary Clinton, says The New York Times.
The enthusiasm is the most remarkable surprise of the long expected work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann over the election campaign in 2012, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is a copy of the nearest book, and it reported on Thursday evening that the President's top advisors would have carried out "great group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" in order to find out whether the hope of re-experience for Obama is a better way when it drops by Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National politician of the Times, the book is thoroughly recording the history of the efforts of the campaign and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, which has the impact on the survey values to exchange the former Minister of Foreign Affairs against the Vice-Presidents.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the closest advisor of the president – including Daley, the former campaign leader of Obama, Jim Messina, and the former governor of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the change thought.
"Double Down" claims that Daley had been able to exchange bids in spite of their 'engen, personal conditions' before one finally decides against such a tract after the data showed that the candidate Clintons would not "probably improve the opportunities of Obama".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government actually had thought to replace Biden by Clinton.
“I expressed a number of things you should consider, and that was one of them," said Daley to the magazine.
We must remember that the President had terrible surveys at that time, so we thought: “For God’s will, what do we do?”
While Daley referred to the investigations as “bottomed care”, Martin said to Anderson Cooper by CNN that during the campaign for the re-electoral, there was a significant effort to find out whether such a train was paying out in terms of the electorate.
“Campagnes don’t spend so much money for surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," Martin explained to AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change decision.
Even though Daley stated that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was “conscious”, the former Chief of Stab said that it was “possibly” that Obama knew of it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide the final answer to the question whether the political sindations of Obama had reached.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought that Obama didn't know any of the studies about whether to drop bedes in the elections.
"May," Martin replied.
What's going on with my e-mail?
In fact, e-mail is called electronic letter.
Did the design of the Internet service have e-mail been implemented similar to the technical letter secrecy during the conventional post?
In the conception of early Internet services, it was in the first place to make communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols do not consider creating a stable foundation for an listening letter change.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open card rather than a versioned letter.
When user sends "Anna" an email to "Benni, are the computers of the two directly connected?
The e-mail program or the Anna browser sends the mail to its service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider using Benni.
On the route, the mail can run via some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content with its provider.
Will conventional e-mails read through the network?
Most mails are read by software robots on the way.
The sender's provider is usually verified whether the mail will lead a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the provider checks whether it is a disadvantaged and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or, at least, removed into an spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information needed to place Google context turbine.
If Anna and Benni communicate via their coming holiday trips via GMail, Google can interfere with corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do you also read unknown people with the emails?
The probability that unauthorised persons read a mail is extremely low.
Theoretical, however, is that possible.
In companies often, administrators have the opportunity to read electronic posts.
The criminal prosecution authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to catch or notify e-mails.
This means possible illegal explosion actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With an encryption following the OpenPGP standard, an email can be encrypted effectively against composing.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to convey the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that not even can be detected without any further means who has communicated with who.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
In the main privately used postfächers, Yahoo and Google play only a sub-ordinary role in an investigation by Convios Consulting from August 2013.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had last fallen, GMail could make it clear to Google.
Mother deteriorated in the forest and rent
When his betrayed mother died, a man from Wolfsburg had a plan.
He cherished the dead in a forest - and continued to cover her pension and care money.
For further rent and care money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother after inquiries of the police in the forest.
First, he had deceived the death of the 89-year-olds, then he took the money more than another half years.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man has already been suspected in May: at that time, there were no need for nursing any medicines anymore.
The intermediary told the pensioner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because the officials found this remarkable, they continued to determine.
The two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and had last kept them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, an obduction did not provide evidence of a capital crime.
Does Ice Crem that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first in the dark ice – using squares.
Charlie Francis made use of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a shining leakage.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on squares and could convince Chinese scientists to produce the illuminating protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, thus lifting the pH value in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the food ice reacts to warmth in the mouth and light – the more you leck, the brighter it will.
Charlie, founder of the Eiscreme company “Lick Me I'm Delicious” says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
If the mouth warms up the protein, the pH-value rises and the ice lights.
We have tested it in the last months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween, because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice creme I've ever produced, because the quallen fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's funny for it.
Charlies experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, with beer, cheese, beef and sheet gold.
But his latest creation is to become more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice creme."
This is on and for itself impossible because of the light break, which is called by the ice crystals, from which ice creme consists; but I suspect that we find it an opportunity to create it.
The ice creme uses the fluorescent properties of a qualm produced by Chinese scientists artificially
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Verbandliga after six days.
It is now counted for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated last weekend of his first victory.
With this game, the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have the head free," Ehlers gives itself optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has available its complete framework.
Also Daverden puts as we do on temporarily game.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase the cover which has left everything else than a safe impression.
After the first seasonsieg against Nordhorn, Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz will be able to win.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's why we're not the favourite for a long time, because in Derby everything can happen.
Even though Panitz wants to follow in Morsum to start a series.
Missing Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Jugend Joost Windßus, who is active with the A-Jugend-Bundesligists HC Bremen, is its season debut.
Whoever isn't hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweethearts, stay late and complain for the neighborhood.
Today I became a hello-ween-muffel.
In the last two years I have not explained ready to distribute my apartment from sweetness, and I will not do it this year too.
But, according to statistics, I'm a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – this year Halloween and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars for sweetness, costumes and decorations, says the US-American association of retailers (NRF).
One thing I rejoice every Halloween then again is the trend values.
The costumes will make up approximately 1.2 billion US dollars distributed from 6,9 billion, says the NRF.
In this year, exciting uneven objects of the last cry.
Women don't have to put themselves into sexy clothing anymore, they can now also embodie in sexy food like pizza, Hamburger or carottes.
As for men, I expect any amount of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Worldwide Changes will create it this year into the Instagram Feds.
According to Google, the most desired costumes Zombies, Batman, Pirates and Hexes are.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We clothed our dogs last year and weren't alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
We are not temperable about sweetnesses.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are approximately 270 million kilograms of chocolates, luxurys, bonuses and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Ministry of Trade, passing through the quarter with the word “Sweets or Saures”.
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't prefer anything – eat.
The only thing that we do not want to use is the sugar - sweet candy corn; yet, 15 million kilograms of it are sold to Halloween, says the National Association of Süßwar manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corns.
It's a mystery I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween than houses in which it sprinkles.
They have great names such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which, on the other hand, stands in a real prison), 'Howl-O-Scream' and 'The House of Shock'.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognised spook houses in the United States, which reach 500 million dollars, so America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos where you are just pinking into the hooze and then put the friends on Facebook where you won't get them back, and one of the type on which you are standing leaves a comment like “neted face expression”.
But let's get to the bastards.
Charlie Brown trusted us with the big turbis when we were children, and the snatching of a cubicle is like the dirt of the Christmas tree – something that we have made from little.
Congratulations, the "Baby in the Kürbis" trend began, only last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us have grown up to fix the corbis and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for cubs, says the US Census Bureau.
The clobby laser who slowly rotates in the pregnancy probably comes from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of pigs were harvested.
If you want to do the right point, you call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and get some hips from their 921 pounds of heavy kürbis.
Apartment fire in Helmbrecht: rescue forces mountains cooled bodies
The fire war had to jump in Helmbright late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof starts to the Friday fire.
The rescue forces mount a cool body from the house.
In the case of a fire in Helmbrecht, rescue forces have found a cool body in a three-family house.
Whether it was an inhabitant still unclear, as a speaker of the police in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it had burned in the ground floor of the house.
When the firefire arrived, the flames already struck out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the bodies in a room.
This and another room burned completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police speaker continued.
First, the building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause for the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest Landeskirche has launched an open-off in order to renounce for the pastor's profession.
Background is a possible lack of pastor: The Evangelical-lutheric Landeskirche Hannover calculates that the number of its presently will be half up to 1,800 pastors and pastors to this location by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good future views, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day run itself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche has first commissioned a pastor in a full place to enthusiast young people for the theology study.
At present, fewer young people decide to study theology after the abitur.
Burfien brings this back to the process of decimation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The occupation of great freedom and diversity was characterised by this.
I am Mr of my appointment calendar and can set my focus on what I am important.
Pastors could be very close to people as a seal career.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
Surely more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for this.
This is what young people today face, not just career, but a sensed work.
According to information from the Landeskirche, which includes three quarters of Niedersachsen, around 60 pastors are currently resting.
At the same time, some 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In thinly occupied border areas such as the harz, the emsland or the turnland, it could be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien, among other things, wants to organize for young people’s studies and also invites prominents who have studied theology.
The theology study has a wide range of training.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior, race seats and six-point barbecue will be found as well as a volunteering system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with the care of Bowler-Works and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The Rally clients who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people who are looking for tension and adventure, as well as a accessible way to world class events.
We are pleased to open this way in partnership with country Rover and the MSA, and we believe that the format creates new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare new ones to the streets and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the defender challenge wake – that will be a entertainable Championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge and the option to participate in the desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fuel fighting to rescue a pond, which lay 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock spring in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the stone break in its male location
Fire warriors jumped off on rock wall and saved the dog before the safe death
The fire war managed to bring a pendant in security that was fixed on a 15 meters high jump in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had passed away on Sunday afternoon after a traffic accident and survived three days alone before it was saved from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who belongs to the dog, came to the stone break in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to take Ruby back into receipt and thank you for the fire guns of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been desperately searched for their missing hündin and released help calls in social networks when she was released into the stone break after the small traffic accident.
About 14:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who was performing his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meters high paragraph in the stone break.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station eiled and went to the rescue of Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move any muscle during her salvation – she was like steif freezing.
But now she's fine.
She was eating a few dogs after that.
That was quite unusual.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a great happiness.”
It was the possibility that she was very seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was examined to the veterinary doctor, which did not determine anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “To see salvation was anxious.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained if the exhaustion had become too large and it had been broken down, it would probably be crashed.
The firms have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firms were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never made Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
In an interview with an Australian radio channel this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer to Jaggers Song “Old Habits The Hard” from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the old dryer at night, and that “he had touched me when I was 18.”
She added: "This is long ago and he was very nice to me."
In a declaration, a representative Jagger, 70, on Thursday, said that he “categorically devoted that he had ever done approaching trials with Katy Perry.”
The representative added: "Perhaps she has changed him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a visit to the Rolling Stones Tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed on Anhieb on place 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European defence gives the Scottishs the choice
A new day, a new fearful story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent country of Scotland is required to join the Schengen room as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about pass controls in Berwick and a limit secured with stalked wire along the Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template was noted on the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not play any role in the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that the EU Member States are often entitled to their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at present, the continued non-respect for Brussels would only be a small train agreement in return to what you really want from the Scottishs.
So actually not a story.
And one that has come so in the years that she already looks like a fossil: I first heard the “dependence means pass controls” end at least 40 years ago.
A interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should we expect an independent country of Scotland to dance after the European Pfife?
Why do the London Joch exchange against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The great, after the war-based plan for the association of Europe has been set up in stock.
With the Eurocrise the project of Europe has officially died.
All in the EU, parties win on grounds that are hostile in the EU or want to throw the euro as a Community currency over board.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptian Party has been able to experiencing the free democracy (equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) for almost five million votes at the Bundestagswahl in September and thus effectively distributed the free democracies (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats).
There has always been political resistance against the plan to create a federalistic Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
As a result of the strict savings policy linked by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jack which requires the respective national economy to be held in the common currency, many people feel that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has held its members on exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and that would like to leave German politicians like that.
Without the possibility of devaluation of local currency, South Europe will resume with an integrated productivity disadvantage towards Germany.
The only way is to shorten wages and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
A deeper European productivity problem is behind the current ethical and monetary problems.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives, a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the cost of consumers, the European industry is paying the double for electricity and the fourfold for gas.
This is a boring cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All world wages statements protect the European petrochemic industry not to be pushed into the corner of cheap American rail gas.
As a result, a revolt draws up, especially in France, the EU's first cheese leader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehikel with which Germany was able to hold in chess and have Paris at a glance with Washington.
However, Paris does not need any more than a gate to political legitimation and has expressed Europe's own economic policy to fight the entrepreneured French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens legal courtier, EU-Fourth National has just won a decisive refusal and thus referred to three dominant socialists.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour party that it cannot be able to make a splitting in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What makes Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white Frenchs of the working class?
It would like to use the EU's growth next year to smiling an anti-EU, anti-union currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well cut off in these elections – and that is very well possible – then such a block could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is the point I want to go beyond: in not all the future, the growing recession against the EU and the common currency will come together to eliminate the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the 'European Europe of the (souvere) nations' that has favored General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite businesses may hold on the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to be dismantled from this project in the hope of melting in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific area suggests that Britain alone will stand in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (in last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which is, too, to tell Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I believe that Scotland could be very well driven in a locker European bond if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similar countries is easier in a non-fed Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider it equal to Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the refusal of the proposed (and done) reductions responsible for the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the following Tory Lib coalition.
It would be delightful for Scotland to decide for an independence now only to force a saving policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early Pubertät: Going to grow faster
Afro-American and hispanic girls tend to achieve the puberty rather than their white age-genuss, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean directly the puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic fat lying is a trigger of the early Pubertät
The trend to early puberty is less exposed to boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family topics.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter is already growing in the age of seven or eight years of breasts and harm?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Pediatrics, this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal under American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time resting parents – normally this is not a sign of fast entering the puberty," said Kaplowitz.
Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, harm and shade hair, as well as body smell, are shown earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there was only a light shift during the age of the Menarch (on the first rule of blood) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12,5 years, less than 12,75 in 1970.
“When the breast development begins, it still takes at least two to three years to menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “From Pubertät with Girls: The Essential Counselor to deal with this frequently occurring problem”.
Time is the most accurate test as the puberty progresss.
It is enthusiastic what actually represents the beginning of the puberty, but it is "fruiteif" when the breast increase is accompanied by a growth sub before an age of eight.
In most cases the process is slowed or stagnated – something that a child doctor can monitor precisely.
In the case of faster prescriptions, tests may be shown by an endironologist so that serious problems such as Tumore or cysten can be excluded.
There are treatment methods in order to force an early menstruation and the defense of another result: the premature ageing of the bones, which can result in an ultimate increase in growth and thus lead to small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are oriented at the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is retaining what drugs is going on, but he admits: “The oppression of the puberty can milden behaviour problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their age.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They care about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," a woman whose daughter got ten days.
Even if there were first signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came frightened and excited from school to home because she was the first in her friends circle.
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there are no clever evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages would be predominant in the media.
Boys come similar to girls earlier to the Pubertät.
Caplowitz believes that the most convincing premisses are the epidemic of fat lying.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine, making a link between body fat and the entry into the puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, Afro American and hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white age ghosts.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty of all possible things seems to be influenced from economic conditions through climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys have already grown the facial and shade hair, the trend is not the same as girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shame hair is even widened with babies and children.
“We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of the puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to advise their child doctor how to talk to their child.
“This can mean that you must have a conversation earlier than expected,” riet Kaplowitz.
If you stay quiet, the child usually responds well.
Girls, which are early bleeding, need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life even if he enters earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturer disputes in the face of large orders on seating width
There is a conflict between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in the tourist class at long-strip flights, which indicates the sound for bitter collapse on Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is rounded around the seat width offered by passengers in long flights in the tourist class – not always those to seek the airlines most, but this indicated space represents the key to the responsive claims for the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus requested this week a industry standard, which prescribes a seat of at least 46 cm (18 inch) in the tourist class, but US-American Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The conflict comes at a time when the aircraft farmers force to sell even larger versions of their two-motored long-strip flights and expect record contracts on the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the back part of the plane is designed – especially if there are nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the specified economic results to deliver the new "Mini-Jumbo" design.
Boeing claims that its modernised 777X is 406 persons in the tourist class, which are more than 17 inches wide and allow 10 per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transported 350 people in 18 in customs seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Airplanegents often share the technical details of advertising in the special press.
Now Airbus appeals to the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new show war and showed a picture in which three people were in a restaurant together, and the title: “Wilt you accept this?”
“Boeing proposes long-term flights in seats, which are closer as regional Turbo props," says Airbus driver John Leahy.
As a result of modified diet habits, people are thicker, but plane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-range trip, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, the US Ministry of Health.
According to US health statistics, the Taille Number of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his Rivale holds a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body range of the freshly baptized “Jet Set” was narrower.
So Airbus has carried out investigations that made an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increased the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing contradicts Airbus's figures to the seat sizes and says that it is not to decide in the measure of the manufacturer how airlines make the balance between airlines and institution.
The company also explains, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seating width.
“It is really going on to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they feel to be successful,” explains Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dict them what they make profitable.
They know their business better than any other one.
For passengers, it is more ellipse-free, but for manufacturers it will be increasingly an issue that can affect turnovers.
Behind the conflict, a race stands around airplane orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars after listing prices in the coming decades, which could significantly affect the export balance of the USA or Europe.
As Reuters reported first in July, the seat layout is the driven force behind the conflict for the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest two-motoral long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements Boeings to the results depend partially on the comparison of 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than machines currently used with ten seats per row.
“Boeing therefore calls more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analytics, full cabinets with ten seats per row in existing 777s suggested that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, what could be done with cheaper airlines.
“Athense customs seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from a economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by threat by the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin establishment, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The worldly traveling Jet sellers even contribute to band size in order to impose the establishment at competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer Jets with high-performance design for cheap flight lines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-suite rows, but has not yet sold any one according to its own statement.
Until recently Airbus stressed the importance of adaptability of the cabins and offered for some Jets wide seats on the bendings.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of great modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard would probably be distributed, but could fall from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-Nicotin vaccine could make pleasure when smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotin vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking.
One single dose of vaccine could protect mice for life from nicotine addiction.
Before human tests, further tests are needed for some years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tested all the methods available on the market, but it was necessary to experience that their nicotin-sucht is greater than these approaches," Cornell says.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains genetic information for the production of nicotin antibodies.
The virus infects selectively the liver cells, which then produce a constant electricity of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which means that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice, for which Nikotin was administered, maintained their normal level of activity.
Mom without vaccination, however, had taken a “time”, researchers declared a sign that the nicotin had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine section.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because of their antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and unpracticable.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could be sure to be administered to children before trying to test a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotin-sufficiency.
But more likely it is that smokers would use him to stop.
“They know, then, when they start to smoke again, they don’t feel any pleasure anymore because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to put the habit down,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi contradicts being influenced by Obeid
Against the former Minister of the Laboratory Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by the State Corruption Surveillance.
The former NSW Minister contested to have changed the rules on maritim discharge on request of its political mentor Eddie Obeid, which had covered participation in three lands in state-controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) has expanded its studies on whether Obeid has influenced different Ministers of State, to extend pacht contracts on the Circle Quay where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without awarding them in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi has been aware of obeids' interest in the grounds after Tripodis had declared earlier deputy steabschefin Lynne Ashpole on Thursday accordingly.
In many years of discussions that started in 2005, the government had encouraged public tendering for pacht contracts.
The passengers were, on the other hand, and they wanted to go longer.
In 2009, the bag contracts for companies were extended to the obeids for $2.5 million per year without public award.
Tripodi, who was minister of ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally expressed public awards.
However, he refused to have made changes to the requests of Obeid, which, as Tripodi confirmed, urged the government to transform the watch arrangements.
One of the ICAC's telephone texts revealed talks between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a governing official who was switched to the port ministries after working under Obeid in the fishing authority.
"Is the subject discussed in this telephone talk the development of commercial discharge schemes?" asked the deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was spoken, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighters attack goals in Syria, such official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a goal in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a governing government collaborator to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said that it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, it was Russian SA-125-Racts.
At least twice this year, Israel has already performed airfall on rocket deliverys in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-Visa could be undercuted "Eurth Test"
In the framework of advanced measures, the government considers a "equivalent test" for foreign workers with 457-fives.
If the test is introduced, it shall be used by a criterion to prevent the use of 457 in order to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government's proposal was published after the former parliamentary of the laboratory party, Maxine McKew, condemned the government's comments in terms of foreign workers, because they could be relied on by the neighbours of Australia.
“Laut-speaking statements such as , foreigners should put themselves back” and, Australian first, are a very unsatisfactory fall in times where trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region an echo of this historical artifact would not admire me.
The discussion proposal covers twelve measures which have once been taken into account by the former emigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who lived yesterday on talks about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still considered.
If the ‘Eignity Criterion’ is taken over, someone requesting a visa could be examined in the light of whether ‘the application is true in the cases in which the applicant is related to the owner or an relevant person of the supporting company’.
Company could also be obliged to pay accounts of the number of 457-five holders after, in the past, only a small number of workers wished to support, hundreds have finally set up.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old sri-lankian asylum probably died at a heart infarct after this week he arrived with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced by the British government to increase the benefits of the HS2-eisenbahn project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed connections between Scotland and the northern England are already carried out at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “will bring Britain closer together”.
The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased to work on this plan with the British government.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway connection between London and the West Midlands.
After grade 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated costs for building the high-speed road between London and Northern Ireland from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, which is in conversations with Transport Scotland, has assigned HS2 Ltd to search for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern Ireland and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period from last three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a real national route network that brings close to Britain and its cities."
We go ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it we face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: “The today’s announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for "unmissible" to be used in the HS2 network for Scottish integration.
Brown said: “The high-speed railway connection is the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but the economic power of Scotland also delivers an argument for fast railway connections throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for high-speed railway connections in Scotland, create the benefits for all and complement the connection Glasgow-Edinburg, which already plans the Scottish government.
I am pleased to examine the research report with the British ministers next year and jointly decide to take the next step.
Constraints on electronic devices in aircraft remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian passengers also have to continue to disable tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the USA, to lock the rules for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enables US airlines to change their standards so that passengers can read on their devices during critical flight phases e-books, see or play videos if they are in the “Flight Mode”.
During the majority of the flight, passengers are already allowed this, but many people find it angry that they should not read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement US airlines to take a number of work, but do not follow direct plans to amend their rules.
The CASA air insurance authority also stated that the notification was being considered, but stressed that restrictions in the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia are still applicable.
‘CSA has currently no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft’ has been declared.
The issue is subject to provisions which, according to airlines, must maintain security at any time and follow passengers the safety instructions given by the cabin person.
Virgin has already spoken with CASA about the extension of its Wi-Fi maintenance system to flights and explained that you are open to changes, but they should be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (dreadless entertainment) during the flight," said a speaker.
Qantas explained that you will stay in the current regulations until now.
“Our current directives predict that electronic devices should not be used at the start and landing time, and we have currently no plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons therein.
The decision is different in US-American companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand bag programs and customer instruction.
“After a airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can passenger the use of tragable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at each height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases when bad views, the crew will demonstrate passengers while landing turns off the devices.
In addition, the group recommended that heavyer appliances be destroyed safely under the seat or in the fans over the seats.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, borrowed BVB connectors with lightrakets for luminous scenes in Veltins-Arena had provided.
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the soccer covenant against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost already sponsored acoustic, which offered the viewer until just before the beginning of the Bundesliga game between the German Vice-President Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
The guests were mostly with their singers to hear.
On the other hand, the southern tribe, where the faithfulest of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, first presented extraordinary silently: No songs, no battle calls.
The podest of Capo, which else coordinated the common fire, remained unset.
And all forward on the tribbon weave a large flag with the notation "Section of Stadion Prohibition".
Only as the Torkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always the first BVB players betrayed the place, burned up short-term jewels.
When his team colleagues followed, there was loud singing and wearing Schals - but not long anywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribe, nothing was right.
Norbert Dickel also once again saw the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory about Arsenal, contract extension of Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not care for celebration.
Only five minutes before the appendix, the Capo clames its podest - and that, until then, with the hands of gripful tension, eluded in a loud cry when Dickel as habited the mood on the slopes in the stadium.
As the last time, the southern tribe was on the line - and finally here was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, as with appendix from the southern tribbon, the loudly strong call "Derbysieger stands up," was everything again as always.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the members of BVB followers had fired lightrakets into the viewing and on the spot - and almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfellers.
The game was so late for the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras thereafter in his office - and you believe Watzke words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-section," said BVB-Boss on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As a immediate measure, Watzke prohibited Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I have prohibited," he explained.
We cannot suspend the zero tolerance policy in matters of pyrotechnology.
In addition, the Ultra's various ways of punishment were shown - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction to the end of the next week.
"This is cutting," assured Watzke.
You may be stressed as the reactions to the southern tribe will then fall.
Pfand houses tree in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a couple of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there's my whole money in there," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned 3.000 Singapore dollars (about 1.730 euros) every month and did not work with her husband, she did not explain the monthly family income.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – is so large that valueMax, where she has done her fragrance, was the third pfand house that is listed at the singapurian stock.
The apartment of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1.300 Singapore dollar in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an uncertain bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhouses in Singapore require an effective annual interest of 17 percent, which is just just over 15.4 percent demanding the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center.
Pfandhouses provide, however, the advantage that there is no review of creditworthiness or income evidence is necessary, so that loans are faster than in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region apply to farmhouses, after families feel the pressure by increasing living costs and increasing financial and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a more locking financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium-sized income peanhouses seeking to balance the difference in deterrent economy.
This week, the Rating Agency Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly by increasing mortgage, was a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore estimated that the Agency has the highest financial debt in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia stands at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
People's economies are also concerned because of the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday the data showed an existing export weakness and a discharge of consumer demand.
“In the final effect, this means that, given increasing costs, people will try to complement their income in the middle to the lower segment (the income scale) wherever possible", says Song Seng Wun, Econom at CIMB, a Malayse bank.
Historical high levels at the gold prices over the last two years have increased the trend to spoil personal objects, as people use the opportunity to change the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the planted items are in the 200 Pfand Houses of the City of Gold.
People say: “The gold prize looks good, let us take up grandmutters of gold chain and bring back next month.”
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20-procent customer growth in the last months.
The growth in the Pfand business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, not only wants to expand to the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company is four houses – but also outside Asia, says Ja Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company financed the 60% of the 66 million Singapore dollar, which took it this week with the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors were advised because of high interest rates into the cruise fire, yes that PFD houses did not only pay cheaper interest than other distributors but also not directly increased the debts.
"Kundes are already in possession of items, and the liquid personal value does not increase budget shifts," she explains.
The Pfandleih business is increasingly accepted as a short-term, secure financing.
Also, not all people who use peanutiles are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come into the branches of ValueMax to farm gold barriers and Rolex tubes, for which they will receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
To us customers come from every social layer.
"There are well-being people who are lying something for a business or an investment short-term, or small firms who have to blew in the cash flow," says yes.
Sometimes they just just need very fast money.
NSA saugs data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Edward Snowden's secret service enthusiast has principle interest in helping Germany to explain the ever brilliant NSA peppers.

Sales package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanic Health
The Australian government consists of the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanic Health System in order to ensure that the government of the state cannot dispose of money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "incomprehensive measures" to avoid a crisis caused by an alternate population of the island, a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
Financing for a period of four years was decided after government advice with the independent Tasman Member Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has snatched a emergency relief package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges faced by the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325-million dollar package includes 31 million dollars immediately support for electoral services.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopedic interactions and treatments due to gray star, are intended to be eliminated residues.
In addition, there are money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care for stationary stays, specialist education, psychological health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas of which I have said that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanic Health System," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister was on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman government.
The state must maintain the current financing level to be able to get money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were issued.
A three-popular Commission is set up and should ensure that the State provides health services as effective and efficient as possible.
Today, Wilkie stated that the 325 million dollars would not benefit if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public tasmanic health system to a more sustainable course”.
On the other hand, he praised the government that she had responded to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in May.
"I am confident that federal aid will contribute greatly to taking the public health system of the state of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely cover the recent cuts.
But the opposition of the opposition at Bundesebene, Peter Dutton, is the view that today's announcement is just a “plaster solution”.
"We are therefore in the present situation because the laboratory government has deducted $430 million from the health system," he said on ABC TV.
It may not be that a government is almost a half billion dollar out of the system and that the Commonwealth is 300 million and then do as if the good news were.
Dutton called Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the rescue package is issued for additional office cracy.

Syria has destroyed its possibility to produce chemical weapons, a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gas munition, and the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday explained, while in the north of the country there came to be severe collapses near one of the locations where mudible toxic substances are stored.
At the same time on Thursday, a Syrian activist group stated that since the beginning of the civil war, more than 120,000 people have been killed soon ago.
The announcement of the organization for the ban on chemical weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, which had been set by the Damascus in Den Haag to destroy all the equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons, or to make "inoperable", including all machinery for the mixture of chemicals to toxic gas and the filling of munition.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all the chemical weapons of Syria until mid 2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus still has to begin destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including senfgas and nervous gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira took place on Thursday, from the experts say that there is a production facility for chemistry weapons and warehouses, as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights was told in the UK.
The activeist group, who pursued the number of dead across a network of activists in Syria, explained on Thursday that 120.296 people had died.
61.067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the side of the government, 29.954 of them were the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 government-friendly fighters and 187 Libanese Hisbollah militarys.
At the same time under the dead, 2.202 deserted armysol data and 5.375 opposition fighters, many of them are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict to 100,000.
This number has not been updated until now.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assads Truppen has been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observatory said there have been losses on both sides on Thursday but no details.
The fighting underscores the danger of the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberation of Syria from its poisonous army is a race against the time in the midst of a deaf civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is closely working with the United Nations, the team is “not convinced that it saw all the important production and mixture/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has lived with its destruction”.
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of the verifications and 21 of 23 of the places specified by Damascus.
Because of safety thinking, the visit of two institutions would not have been possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPWC stated that the two locations were given according to Syrian statement "and the objects present in the chemical weapon programme were moved to other called institutions, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee.
“I take the hat before the tape and the courage you have shown when you fill out the most challenging mission that has ever been performed by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Observatory Organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
Since now three years, the most important sunny Muslim rebellions in this civil war against Assad's government and their security forces, belonging to many members of the Alawites, fight a depression of the Shiite Islam.
In the light of further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, has given a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of explosion was not known, he explained.
Angry about judgment for Bombenlegers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had been killed in the bombing attack in Bali in 2002 were angry with the judgment for the last founders who were put before the court, since Umar Patek should be firmly shot according to their views.
Patek, who was nearly ten years of escape as one of the most sought persons in Southeast Asia, was condemned yesterday for his role in the construction of sprays for the bombing attack to a penalty of 20 years.
It could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
In addition, a claim was made in a series of terrorist attacks, which include a wave of pollutant attacks on churches in Indonesia at Holy evening in 2000.
The prosecution had requested a lifelong liability, even if it had been applied to death penalty for the man who is called "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a mastery bomb builder.
The decision has awakened painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old winner Jane and Jenny in the devastated decay of Patek and his fellow sisters nearly ten years ago.
With tears, she said that Patek should have been condemned for death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him before a shooting command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with that I won't get any other grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was equaled to the ground when a huge bomb exploded on October 12, 2002 in a smalllaster who was parked before the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Pady's bar, where a suicide adventurer had exploded a polluted backpack only 20 seconds earlier.
He fell three times after the attack for a month into the coma and 'star' while he was hanging on a lifekeeping system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbad and were executed for four years ago.
Really, this type should get the death penalty before all others.
To let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
To get 20 years after killing 202 people and injured many hundreds, is not much.
Patek's the last of the Bali bomber standing at the court.
He was almost a decade of arrest, but was finally attacked in January 2011 in the Pakistan city Abbottabad, where U.S. striking forces nearly four months later killed the former al-Qaida Chef Osama bin Laden.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent stated that secret service reports had shown that Patek was in Pakistan to meet the shop with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't put himself," said Corteen.
Until recently, he did not repent how much suffering he has added to other people.
The judgment took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is committed with Memorial celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can make a call against his judgment.
FAA: Flight passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not lead mobile talks)
From departure to landing, travelers can now hear their electronic devices, work, games, music and use the view of movies, but not phone using the phone, so the new directives issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they would be implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA employees said Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the airlines and the arrangements for the disturbing of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to develop the use of tragable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue also.
"Individually, according to the state of the plan, we could soon authorize the extended use of electronic devices," the FAA announced in a clarification.
Currently passengers need to disable smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may only start them again when the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and give the captain green light.
When entering the landing flight, the passengers need to re-establish them and must not be restarted before the aircraft is landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft were secured against electronic disturbance could allow their passengers to use the appliances also at the start, landing and rolling field, the FAA explained.
Most new transport aircraft and other flyers surrounded for the use of Wi-Fi in larger heights should comply with the criteria.
Laura Gladying, President of the professional airline, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline – it will benefit both sides," commented glading.
We are honestly told to have to feel at this subject like overlookers.
However, connections to surfing, exchanges of emails, text messages or download of data under three kilometres continued to be prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to place smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still not a “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble similar online game, which the actress Alec Baldwin in 2011 played on his smartphone when he had to leave a jet by American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the flight station.
And more difficult devices such as laptops must continue to be lost, as there is a danger of injuries if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone talks during the flight continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is not the FAA with the Federal Communication Commission (FCC).
FAA may have prohibited for certain electronic devices when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said by the Transport Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disorders in navigation devices, but because we know that the transmission from the air can also disturb mission masses," says Rosenker.
A consulting committee of the industry, which was called by the FAA to examine this topic, recommended last month that the government authorises a wider use of personal electronic devices.
During recent years pressure has increased to FAA to lock restrictions for use.
Criticians like the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The limitations are also more and more difficult because the use of the devices has become altogether.
In some studies, the talks that, up to one third of the passengers, miss off the device or ignore it.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by travelers in 1966, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communications devices were known by passengers with the UKW radios then representing the latest technician trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of air vehicles, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interferences do not matter.
Flightlines offer passengers Wi-Fi for some years when the flight height is reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interferences.
The majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment according to the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally give significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-Readers, for example, give only minimum radiation when you refurbish.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are increased.
To the defenders of a locking of the limits for the device use by passengers, Amazon.com includes.
2011 firms invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to determine problems but could not detect.
Members of the FAA Consultation Committee expressed mixed feelings as to the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd from the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he was the view that the disturbance is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only individual reports of pilots that speak for the disturbance of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to order the device by passengers in the field of instruments under poor viewpoints.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described it as a reasonable adaptation for travelers that were now fully equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Recovered by bird rescued by North Sea Bohr Island
A bird that was found on a North Sea Bay island was released by air-reasoning service on the coast of flying.
The water halls have been fled with a helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was puffed into Alloa by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in their rescue center.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “These water halls were probably a winter train bird from North Europe, who was held by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird was looking for refuge on the drilling island.
He added: “He couldn't go on his flight, why we were contacted with the request for help.”
At their release, the water halls were fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to make business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who care for prosperity and work in Britain want to change our relationships with the EU.
To this end, we have ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey under British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 economic leaders, who portrayed in some of the British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be surprised by many.
We have found that the majority of companies are exported outside Europe and focused on countries who are modernizing and growing, while the countries in the EU stagnate.
They wish that new trade links are favored with countries such as China, India and Brazil from the government side instead of keeping up with the long and stressing process of reforming EU institutions.
In view of certain legally regulated topics – from cartllrecht to product legislation –, the majority of economic leaders feels that control of these key competencies should be recovered to Westminster.
There was general uncomfortableness over the internal market, since, according to the statement, the companies' costs of the Brussels regulations would now be the advantages of being part of the trade zone of Europe – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the most traditionally friendly European companies.
Finally, and most likely, our survey of economic leaders revealed that a significant majority of Britain wishes to change the agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy encourages a “sinnful change” that brings the retreatment of action back to Britain.
It is a lot – a change in the Agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change in opinion in the EU’s stay in a national agreement.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that firms expect a clear shift of power ratios back to Britain from a new negotiations.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is moving towards a closer economic and fishermenal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows, which means a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new hostära
The construction of the South Straam pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board stated.
“The present event is a milestone: the construction work at the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, on Thursday in a statement.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the whole European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A conflict between Gazprom and its pendants in Ukraine, in which the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk of conventional routes to be heard by officially.
Miller said that direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical hazards associated with transit countries were disabled forever.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to awarded prices when the entire project is operating in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other countries are intended to begin on the planned route.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of gas.

Consultation before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA co-workers against accusations against Jonathan Lord accused for sexual delicates
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual delicates related to children before 2011 Prerogations against the children's career Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission learned for sexual abuse of children.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA stated that “in the organization we never had to do with an incident of sexual abuse.”
Managing director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA co-worker was accused for crimes with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was sentenced to him because of abuse.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistive lawyers, that he knew the first case, but did not know the second.
It admitted that the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission was also unanimously in the claim, "these has given external verifications of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as a front front front at child safety".
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministerium of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started at YMCA 21, admitted that the management line had failed “abward from me” in the attitude of Lord and not assured that employees had been aware of their obligations to report infringements against the children's safety directives.
Lord was sentenced to twelve boys in his two-year activity for the YMCA in the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years of prison.
Hare, however, refuses that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that the employer had stopped reporting Lord's infringements regarding the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed infringements, including that Lord alone was with children, cared for her privately as a babysitter, put her on his shot, said to one he loved it, and made children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor Lord was and who had asked for a training for child protection because she was concerned about his conduct, said that the child service director Jacqui Barnat, who was the supervised Lord in YMCA Caringbah, was “intimidating and most of the time very infamous.”
The manager stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have trusted themselves to submit their supervisors.
Rather, he said that their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, why they had not reported him.
Hare stated that he told the YMCA NSW’s board that the lesson to be drawn from the "Jonathan-Lord-Incidences" was "not the report" by employees, and the board agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to encourage employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the claims occurred, had been taken by YMCA’s head of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that the contamination of evidence should be prevented, but what has been "accrued" and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was in the time when Jonathan Lord was there between 2009 and 2011 was no safe organization for children, said Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University, expert for sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there have been 'advantaged problems' in the attitude, review, instruction, training and oversight of employees.
The hearing was held until December 20th.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the chance to return as a British Prime Minister – but admit that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview today on the fifth anniversary of his excretion from the Office, the 59-year-old stated his views on various domestic issues.
Since its return in June 2007 after a decade as the Head of State, Blair has largely avoided speaking to British policy, and his comments mostly restricted foreign policy and its role as a Messenger of the Quartet of the Peace Foundation in the Middle East.
At the question whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this happens, so ..."
When the horse watch experts found themselves in kariff to shorten the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition war was imposed.
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the children's garden and has made its first steps just a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee drove faster through the three rounds and took the first price – with 30 adult opponents left behind.
The individual couple, both the same size, was praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his plate moist in a fresh angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in handling the Pony, which is far beyond his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift to his third birthday and had been exercised by Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great team.”
They had to come against the entire participants field and have gone from the place with Goldpokal and Rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Excellent strangers in the Arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, which has been conducting horses for more than ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was as electricized and all fired and clothed him.”
He ran on sand the whole length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he has done tasty work.
Fenton is crazy by animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to whom he cares.
As it is started, it will not take a long time until he is on the “Pferd of the Year”, and I am sure that it will be cut off well.
One speaker of the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his Pony.”
They're a great team together.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had been hit and presented in the preliminary ring.
They respect good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton's sweet clothing contributed to it, that really fits perfectly to the occasion.
Chinese newspaper should be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper on the title page demanded the release of a reporter who had been accused for diffamation should be reformed, said a press regulator.
The New Express in Guangzhou had a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted order fees to counter reports on a part-country company.
The Rules of Procedure stated that the new expression is being subject to a “repealing rectification”.
The ‘Rectification Regulation’ came from the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and TV in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the new Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccessible reports on the stocked company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unordinary," the regulatory authority announced in a declaration.
She said that one has decided to "mount a administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw him his reporter license".
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has indicated that the new Express is fully reviewed and recommended to identify the relevant representatives in the New Express and to immediately verify the new Express leadership team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on supposed financial imregularities with a manufacturer of Baumaschinen called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and put behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen arrived in the TV of State and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the whole news industry and their ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the state news sender CCTV.
I did it in the first place because I was out of money and fame.
I realized that I did wrong.
Following Chens apologize, the New Express published an excuse on the title page and explained that you failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have stated consent on television in recent times.
Experts say that consents are still forced routinely, despite a change in law in the beginning of the year, in which the authorities were prohibited to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-90 centimeter measured tunnel as one of the exposed passages that they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzack pattern over a length of about six football fields, connects camp halls near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless unequivocal camp halls, making it easier to hide with drugs loaded trucks.
The tunnel has been closed before drugs could be transported unawarely, the authorities explained.
In discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured, the records of the court.
Three men who worked as a driver according to the statement of the authorities were accused of marihuana and cokain's intended sale.
They are threatening prison sentences between ten years and lifelong.
In Nogales, Arizona, smuggler sets on an extended underground network of relaxing channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexiko in October, which challenges drug cards how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a almost 640 meters long passage with rails that lived from a kitchen in a living house in Tijuana to two camp houses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love
Actor Saarlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr wants to go separate paths in the future.
In a interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Saarlando Bloom has spoken for separation from his wife, Top Model Miranda Kerr.
In a interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was supposed to be radiated on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "the life sometimes does not go just as we plan it or hope it".
Kerr and he still loved himself, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, in 2011 her son of Flynn was born.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to vegetarism, but is quite significantly different from this.
For while vegetarians allow the consumption of sahnetors, ice or a strong edamer, these sleeves do not stand on the food map of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the contradiction of meat and fish, the veganer leaves from all the diet of animal products - also honey is refined.
What remains may be questioned, but in a closer consideration, the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable incidence.
"Broads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the holder of this reform house, which provides a variety of specific products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also welcomes the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the emerging New Zealand countries have lived vegans, and in Lampertheim he (fast) finds everything he needs to live. "1997 I killed my diet and became Vegetarier."
Around the century, the next step took place, and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of food, but because of the shoe option," says Proctor who prefers normal leather.
He realized that there is also other daily concerns without animal products.
Vegan is primarily an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor expresses the maximum of the vegans that extend to the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of bringing behind civilians, riding animals or rubber bears, the Veganer has quickly discovered very new products that rising enthusiasm.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "Everyhow vegan represents no deviation, no questionese, but it's an areaing". The assumption that with the food consumption, the choice of food options is reduciare, Proctor is rather leading to the power of habit.
And exactly these conditions also caused some to fail so well common attempts.
"The search factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up fast, similar to smoking," proctor creates a comparison.
And apply: "Determined vessels are not to be fixed to the animal."
Often they are the wounds or the kind of preparation that make the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in a different way," explains the Veganer.
To a barbecue, for example, Proctor brings Auberginen, Champignons and a few vegan worsts.
He looks forward to a balanced, varied diet, where it is almost to be defy.
Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should be taste, but it is not just to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Healthal damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, has not suffered.
For me, the transformation had a positive aspect.
I don't take a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share.
There are high-performance athletes that feed themselves exclusively vegans.
"My blood values are best, I often let myself check," says Proctor.
In particular, before the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warned.
"Because animals are feeded with feeds instead of grasping on the wheat, it is obvious whether in the meat you buy in the cooling truck, which is high to vitamin B12 part," Proctor finds.
For vegans there is also the opportunity to take the coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he explains.
Far paths must not go proctor for food creation.
The basic nutrients are finally available everywhere, and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
All I need, I'll find on place.
I'm just buying something special.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but so it is well known to "usually" finished products".
In addition, the preparation of vegan courts was far cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly adopted.
"In the kitchen there is much to discover with a few small knife you can achieve good if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more backpowder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cheese can also bring proctors to the stain.
Family festivals give the Veganer a new wrestle.
It's dynamic when you buy together, that's a new job value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, however, he was already taken up skepsis.
Don't you worry my food anymore?
"Shall I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - In such questions, you must act as a vegan with finger tip feeling.
"I don't lose people, I am a part of this society," Proctor does not want to take any enclaving time.
And more precisely, the everyday world doesn't appear as vegan stranger than asserted - and the Veganer does not limit as in everyday life.
Fast food is also allowed.
Dams are there everywhere!
"Many döners offer folafels, or just a vegetarian Yufka," Proctor says.
In a pizzeria he devotes to pasta judges, or orders just a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slowly available on it.
"When I began to feed vegans 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealand countries can find a development: "You must talk to people to pay attention to them."
"If enough demands come, they may tend to complement the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the combs in Mannheim or the cafe bird free.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan court on the food card.
In principle vegan courts are taken for all there.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusively.
"Fleish judges, however, are exclusively, in the truest sense of the word, because they close others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the most important part of the front," says Proctor.
However, the shopping of vegan products could be somewhat difficult at the beginning.
In particular, if one learns to understand, which can also be included in earthn nuts of animal additives as a colouring agent, it seems to be quick to leave the courage with the follow-up of the ethics in so many hurdles and cases.
Not only, therefore, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning products.
"After and after, you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to remain or to stolpen," knows Proctor.
Veganism, he's an important moral-finger-finger-calling on consciousness.
Perhaps he does not make it completely possible for you to settle his habits, but at least he can teach the consumers to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in breath.
Trade on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator responsible for technical problems.
The other 11 US Option Markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a series of smaller and larger pines in the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the indexes of Nasdaq were not calculated for an hour in data transport.
In August this year there had been two pans alone in a week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massly corrupt purchase jobs to the options markets because of technical problems.
The stock operators then needed almost a whole day to watch and strike the orders.
Two days thereafter, the half of the total share trade in the USA came for several hours because of a computer pan at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
In the last year, the launch of Facebook had also been cared for overlooking.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown up to the flood of purchase and sales orders, later the SEC stock stock was established and the company doubled to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Radler drives 63-year-olds
To the accident it came after information from the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, at 22 a.m., with a lady bike on the left hike from the station to the market place.

British Police Advocates Assange
Today, the British police gave a decision of delivery to WikiLeaks-Green Julian Assange, seeking refuge in the ecuadorian Embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian had a “repetition to make himself” which asked him to appear in a police guard, adding that he should not comply with it, threaten the arrest.
Assange is threatening the issue to Sweden because of the claims in a sexual delicate after its possibilities are exhausted in British law, since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to the delivery of the month.
As he feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he had been seeking refuge on 19 June in the ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "assigned to a 40-year-old man to put himself at one of us chosen time at a police guard," said a speaker.
He continues to hurt the conditions of his release on cheating.
The message did not comment on the provision of the Political Invoice.
Assange fears that he is delivered from Sweden to the United States and accused there for possible spionage claims after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks website.
Drivers who had been scratched with 210 km/h and hot drink between the legs receive 1.000 £ penalty
A car driver was set up a penalty of 1.000 £ because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.

After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester Court, Howie was guilty without being the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month drive ban.
In addition, Howie was sentenced to pay costs of 90 £90 and a price of 100 £.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculative blossom
The Ministry of Finance has provisorically chassised the CGT measure through calculation, but still waits for the final decision of treasure Chancellor George Osborne, who had linked a tax of 7% to apartments that costs more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers, homes as a company and not as individuals.
In 2012-13, revenues from the Stempel Tax for residence in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were surrounded by 708 million pounds in the 2012-13 tax year, summarised for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increases in Stempel Tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the legislation to deal with it, it is difficult to say that high-quality real estates are too low, regardless of the effects of the obsolete municipal tax system."
"This step could make some foreign investors more retaining what the purchase of real estate in London is going on or keeping owners from selling it," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the apartment market at price – in the well-being London Southwest guarantee, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has depicted the record value of 11.8% in last year.
The prices in Central London show a balanced annual growth of 5.6% but were overestimated by an endeavoured ‘land market’ on which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an increase in savills.
Scientists could threw more light on what is the relationship of a dog's drumble with its mood.
Former research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were wailing more to the right (for the vision of the dog), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to it.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuro scientist of the University of Trient, said: “Mans are well well known that the left and right brain helicopters respond differently to stimuli that create positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this at other species.
He also noted that in dogs the right brain halfs were responsible for the movement of the left side and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the sidely dwelling of their artmates, researchers monitored the animals while these movies looked at other dogs.
They measure the heartfrequency of the four people and analysed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail is moving into one, once in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dog movies with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate discerning other aspects, and so we could more control the movement of the tail to the left or right."
When the animals saw how a unprecedented dog moved the tail to the right (from the perspective of the stumbling dog), they stayed completely relaxed.
But when the tailor was mostly left (here from the perspective of the dog who wobble), their heartfrequency rose and they looked unreasonable.
Professor Vallortigara feels that the dogs do not communicate with them in a deliberate way.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should take care of and when not.
He said: “If you have various matches with other dogs and the wedding is linked to the tail in a direction more friendly and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of these experiences."
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners, veterinary and trainers could help improve the understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert of dog behavior and hospital racing at the University of Bristol Faculty of Animal Health, explained that this was not the first study in which the study was examined whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team of Lincoln's University discovered that dogs rotate the head to the left when she looks at an aggressive dog and to the right when it's a satisfactory dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, it was said: “Hunde go more to a robot dog when his,Schwzz’ links wambles and not to be right, instead of being unreasonable, just elsewhere than in the Italian study.”
So, according to his statement, the differences could indicate that the dogs in the various studies could not interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study, how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he explained.
“While there are significant evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes, but many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs do not make any exception," says Bradshaw.
However, since her behavior simply records, it will probably not take a long time until we understand why the tail is sometimes moving into one, sometimes into the other direction.

Pope Franziskus appointed first cardinal in February
Pope Franziskus will be called new cardinal of the Catholic Church on February 22, first, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Kardinal are the rankest clerk in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also who choose a Pope, so that Franziskus will order the first group of men to participate in the choice of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal that has reached a age of 80 is no longer able to participate in the Pope election – that is true of a group of 120 “suitable cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Pater Federico Lombardi, a Vatican speaker, would take place a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony is held for the appointment of the new cardinals known as consistorium.
“Papst Franziskus has decided to present his decision to approve the consistorium in February in advance so that other meetings that may require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of voting-laws would probably fall down until February.
He explained that a Pope usually calls as many cardinals as needed so that the number of cardinals who have voted for retreat 120 again, and so many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistorium in the next year is therefore important because it was the first since the French election this year, Valero.
There is currently a certain surpass on Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope Cardinals will call out from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
40 percent of the Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called by the Kardinal Council established by Franziskus, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have ordered to find opportunities to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Well, Franziskus has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He stated that it was “good possible” that Franziskus the cardinals for advice.
But until now we were not in this situation – that's all new.
Valero said that typically the Bishops would call to cardinals from large places, but Franziskus was "ful surprises – so we don't know who he reaps".
GM calls new pickup trips in the United States to repair the seat lehne
General Motors call back nearly 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup-Trucks with the construction year 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat lehne, so a communication from the U.S. regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars there can be a defect in the mechanism for retaining the front seats.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Bundesrichtlinies for vehicle safety in case of head support.
“When the back is driven on the vehicle, it is possible that the head support does not protect the insassen properly, so that there is an increased risk of injury," the message was to read on the National Highway Traffic Security Administration (NHTSA).
The back-up models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM-Trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. car manufacturers since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first October helicopter about the defect.
The NHTSA has not been able to check the letter of notification due to the 16-day Shutdown government, which was negatively affected by car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra Tracks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, was increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup hits sold.
The GM act was increased by 1.4 percent to 37.47 US dollar on Friday afternoon.
Writing of a Obama selector
I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that it would be possible to change.
He says that Obama has made praiseful efforts that have been defeated by the Blockadactics of the Republicans
Blockade policy does not excuse the web site problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memories about the election campaign in 2008 were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at the Harvard Medical School.
I'm currently reading a terrible sad book.
It is a book that I believed that it would open me during the terrible second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It says "The Audacity to Win" (to win) and paints the memories of Barack Obamas on the presidency election 2008.
When I'm done with my patient cutting scripts in the evening and go to bed, the book will bring me back to a time when politics could ride millions of inspired and speaking.
The election was held into an earthquake and news speakers in order to face the historical importance of this hour.
My classmates wept for joy and my parents gathered all their newspapers.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the Nation was ready for change.
When Abama moved to the office at that time in 2008, he had 82% consent.
And then I closed the book.
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening as if you are smelled out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague reminder, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I first played my voice, something has really changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognise the great and versatile things that have reached Obama from the adoption of the affordable Care Act for Health insurance until the military deduction from Iraq, the end of the forced conspiracy of homosexuality in army and the killing of Osama is Laden.
I also believe that the party-political blockadeactics have taken too many efforts to forward our nation: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Talbot Bay to name just a few.
But after I have defended the Obama government against colleagues and knows, I came to the end with my statement requests.
I have reached a point of political impairment.
Republic Blockade policy cannot explain why you are allowed to listen to foreign heads of state or to kill innocent children through drones in Oversee.
It cannot be explained why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished that state disadvantage.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen who has been murdered without procedures, yet why public financing and output limits are handled during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, in which it means that the efforts of the White House for the restoration of the media are the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years since the adoption of the affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I had to understand with 18 that governmental work could contradict its previous political campaign.
Obviously, the Member is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massor prefer public discussion.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely chosen by the government themselves.
And that disturbs me most.
I chose again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidate.
In the middle of Romney, a confusing and unprecedented alternative presented, he seemed not to be able to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would satisfy the hope we had heard so long.
But with the shinning of the approval values for Obama at less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become so harder by this book.
It wakes up in me the vision of the many promises that have been in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a serious loss to Clinton in the preferential elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the voters after the decision, he said to his employees that they should come back to course and follow the purpose of their matter.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
There are five years later, Mr President, and I can't agree to you more.

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had conflicts with interest in parental leave
Milliardary and Member Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in an interest conflict with his plans for parental leave because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The miningmagnate, which is located in a judicial conflict on the payment of $6 million to CO2 taxes, claimed when he wanted to intervene questions from the table, whether it conflicted.
The Palmer United Party may control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only Ministers could have conflicts of interest and would benefit the daughters of Abbott personally from the laws.
“He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental holidays because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives vacation or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission of Palmer, with 53 votes after the newstelling officially explained to the winner of the Sunshine-Coast-Sitz of Fairfax.
Palmer demanded a revision of the process for votes in order to make this quicker.
Tony Abbott's daughter of France and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you are inmarsing, entering data into a computer immediately and then selecting the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the vocabulary.
Do you use it because then you can radiate the results if they don't like it?
It is incredible today to vote with pencils.
The election Commission has examined the options for electronic choice and recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his politics belong to an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “so seriously”.
At a public office it is about the public service.
“We do not seek a reward except that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspend two dealers from its devisory department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another index for the worldwide administrative investigation of the mutual manipulations on the currency market.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they work together with the authorities in the world's largest financial market investigations, on the daily $5.3 daily, dollars.
The two distributors would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the expanding investigation that draws the scandal around the libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on suspensions, confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this subject go on and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation closely indicated that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to an earlier dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and was now supposed to have been authorized by his current position as a European head of the Forex Spot Handle at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was granted this week, and Matt Gardiner, former governing currency dealer with Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No one of these distributors was suspected.
The Instant News Group of Usher, banker belonged to Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation closely.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority had stated Finma that she examines a mutatisfactory manipulation of the devise market in a series of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently concerned with prerequisites that bankers should have spoken on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said with the situation of trusted persons.
Banks get through Instant Messages and emails from several years on the search for cases of lack of behaviour.
The news about these investigations has put the dealers in a field in a row that has been one of the most profitable of the trading banks of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affairs and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extended and high-graduate liquid devisory market, but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume in devisory trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different commercial platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to "influencing the market with very small ticket prices".
The message came out on the same day, when credit suisse announced, she announced this week a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Fund offices after he had caused a loss of about six million dollars in last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is imminent," said Credit Suisse.
The Bauzaun painted on the Bechle-Grund piece
A group of citizens' initiatives "Schweizer Wiese" has sent the Bauzaun on the Bechle-Grundstück at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footway, says it in a press release.
The planned coverage of the broken house in the back of the property was not allowed for security reasons because the site is threatening.
Alfred Abel, who currently managed the property, had spoken with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message "We have been adapted to it".
However, the about 20 members of the citizens' initiative did not disturb that in their action.
Their motto on the great poster said "We are against construction ruins".
She wanted to point to the danger of even larger ruins in Switzerland's grass – the giant project of one day should fail.
In discussion with many passengers before the "Baustelle" it was clear that some citizens believe that it will be much better to achieve the city project, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they begin to resign because the city continues to delay these answers, says it from the BI.
As it was heard, the public statements of the mayor also affect.
In May, the Council had said that he was afraid of the outer for the thermal pool, the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Wisse of Switzerland.
As a result, some seem to be scared, others feel like "pumping enthusiasm" in the population, says it continues in the press release of BI.

Ranksick tents for Shiris: Mane not a sulphur
Ralf Rangnick is also satisfied with the current high form of Bundesliga Table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed by the sports director of the "Bulls".
"There is a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are forced into the category of sulphuring candles," he took the two open-offsivwirls on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
Youngest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegalesen became an alleged actress for casualties - the freely no one was how the TV pictures showed.
"A crassful misleading decision," said Rangnick, the Shiedsrichter Harkam referred to as "delicately overrequired".
Harkam also had contributed "sy part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
He defended his German countryman, "I would have acted like Roger Schmidt in every individual situation".
Schmidt itself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the shame stakeholder.
I don't know why.
"When I am the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old stressed.
With regard to the success cycle, Ranknick agreed to be a lobby.
"for that there are only two words: correctly good," he stated.
There's not much to do.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
That's why you're going on so quietly.
Border changes in winter transfer time will hardly be available.
There are no great reasons to change.
"Apart from a player comes with the desire that he wants to leave the association," Rangnick stated.
Supreme Court confirms Obamas Health Law
It is a great victory for the government of Obama: The U.S. Supreme Court decided today that the closely associated health law with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the patient protection and affordable care Act – it forces U.S. citizens to close a health insurance until 2014 or pay a penalty – is constitutional under the tax authority of the State.
John Robert's chief judge put on the side of the four liberaler members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law and also believed that the provisions of the health law should extend either the conditions of access for medicine or, otherwise, all state medical aids should be disposed of inadequately restricted.
The complaint against the law has been stressed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decided by all the leading republic presidential candidates, including the last requirer in midt Romney, in the preliminary campaign of 2012.
Norway: Norwegian location makes itself with giant levels of light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village of light have brought them into their dark valley.
Due to the low sunfall grade, the Rjukan Rjukan from the autumn to the spring is usually in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors in 45 meters height a century space was true on Wednesday.
"Endly!" weakened mayor Steinar Bergsland at the first ceremony in the sender TV2.
Some talent residents were right for sunshine, others set up sunbrills for securityhalber.
So far, sun hungers had to drive with a sailway to a close summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to lead the rays with mirrors into the valley.
However, these basic ideas have been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the Council of City finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615,000 euros).
A similar construction has been provided to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella for some years.
Post is hardly empty yet Sundays
"Many citizens will have not yet noticed that the red points for the Sunday doctrine are still at different core and the city parts, but you will read the small printed to the yellow containers of the Post AG, you will quickly find out that the retirement of sun and holidays no longer takes place," the FDP tells us.
A FDP request has confirmed that.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post-building in the Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and in the Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 is taught in Hüttenfeld.
Whether still taught Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten, the answer to the FDP is not answered.
The social and jugend political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to look after this.
Sunday retirement is an important postal service at appointment post.
"This is a radical and inconsistency of this company despite the price increase for letters on January 2013."
Thomas Bittner, Group and City Chair of the Liberals, supports his group colleagues, "What is angry with me is that the renewal periods of retirement are unfortunately changed or deleted here".
The post is a milestone away from the neighbourhood.
"To least, the letter boxes in the districts of the town need to be learned again on Sundays and Rosengarten", said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially not mobile fellow citizens should be able to reach a letter box with Sunday doctrine.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city Parliament whether the city administration was planning discussions with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, was also a Sunday doctrine in Hofheim.
Your party has expressed itself for privatizations.
"Then decisions are taken elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt parking fees should increase strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive.
The city's magistrate advises today morning about a template of transport decorative Stefan Majer (Green).
The parking fees are therefore to be increased by 50 percent.
However, the prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking cars and parking machinery should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December then the City Assembly has to be decided.
The IHK Frankfurt Single Trade Committee holds the "no good idea".
The parking possibility immediately before the business is "a not too underestimating advantage for smaller traders".
The transport club of Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "adjustably and in fact long overlapping".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Congratulations city: Quick Actions overridden hosts
With a narrow box, Mr. I of the TSV rejoicing city in the Schiller-Sulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbian Alb.
Although the ealblers were on the other side with an experienced team.
Soon , however , it was shown that she, too oldly, could not fully participate with the quick actions of the joyful cities .
With the hard and placed upsettings, the Gönningers made very difficult.
Again they missed the passages and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean over the network and were not at the block warrant.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the embarrassment of the joyful cities in all interests.
In view of this depressive and play-up performance, the third sentence was won somewhat lash and lustlessly to 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, the TV Manyrquents, which could be clearly enforced in Nagold, will stand a more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B class, the second teams from Manyrs Sources and joy centre were faced with the Murgtal Hall in Manyrs Sources.
They delivered a hard surrounded two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused above all errors and passages during the ball approach; even during the passages, the precision was sometimes lacking and in some critical play scenes, the overseas prevented the view of possible point gains.
In this highly balanced encounter, the Marcus Blasutto TSV team agreed through the great physical operation and a joyful commitment to both teams.
Day of care on the small Engländerhutte
The fifth nurse day in the succession of the Top Hotzenwald project, a group of engaged participants met in the small Engländerhutte in Ibach.
Because of the suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the hut of views should be cut into the valley, mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers, according to emperor, called this area as the gloss of the shooting rock, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked the attendants for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the nursing day is a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection of humans and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to place accents in nature.
At the same time, the tourist aspect can also be considered environmentally.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait by the Department of Nature Protection of the Government of Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the screen rule and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the wide view covers the aim of receiving the now strongly growing old all-wide field with its specific protective lifespace types by opening and connecting to the still existing wideways.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and sprinklers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free connections to keep up.
Tribukait said that they do not want to break a lans in this place for the planned biosphere area.
In this planning, the current measure is not only unsatisfactory.
A biospheric area also offers the chance to sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognised unesco status and thus continuous completion of the life project as well as the previous care days for the future.
Following these various statements, Revierleiter Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers in groups.
The larger trees were already beaten in the forefront, where appropriate, the Forstschlepper was prepared.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of waxed trees and care for a dry stone ribbon.
The aim was the free view at the point of view.
Layings: Choppers still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Bärtchen Lopeningen with its 7514 residents, an intact infrastructure, a future school, a child, a youth and a senior policy, as well as its own city works can be called attractive city, no second candidate has yet reported.
As a single candidate for the success of the burgemeester Norbert Brugger is now the 46-year-old bank buyer and operational operator Dieter Köpfler from Lopeningen.
The application period will expire on Monday, 11 November, at 18 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei accused for Nortel Pattents
The group that has thousands of former Nortel Passes on Thursday stricted a law of complaints because of patent infringement against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company which was exhibited by Nortel's insolvency.
Rockstar, the consortium purchased the Nortel Passes for 4.5 billion US dollars, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies because of patent injuries before the US district court in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the Community ownership of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is overlooked in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents affected technology, which brings search terms to the Internet with relevant advertising, thus the complaint that affects the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones working with Google's operating Android, which stands in sharp competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google gave a initial command for the Nortel patent over 900 million dollars.
Google increased his offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After the rock star's Nortel pattern was overreached, Google Motorola mobility acquired 12,5 billion US dollars, a business that was also motivated to patents in part of Motorola's library.
“While Google failed with his attempt to acquire the complaint patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do this," says the complaint.
Rockstar demands a high loss of damage from Google, since it claims that Google's patent injuries are abrupt, so the accusation.
Egypt competes first free-selected presidents
Mohammed Mursi deposits the officer, but his day of triumph does not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was defended as the first freely elected president of the country and thus followed by Husni Mubarak, who had been distributed 16 months earlier from the office.
With his office in front of the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely chosen Islamist president of the Arab World and Egypt's fifth head of the state since the Sturz of Monarchy about 60 years ago.
He put the oath before the 18 in black robbery clothed judges of the court, which has its seat at the Nile and has an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said Mursi at the celebration ceremony that was transferred live in the state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an trained engineer and member of the Muslim brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which has been mostly taken as a prohibited organization from the respective government for 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police watched the building when Mursi was in a small car convoy after 11 p.m.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to jump the new president, and in contrast to the presidious princing of Mubarak time, the traffic was only delayed so that the car convoy could cross the usual streets that connect the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As uncharismatic ‘Ersetrad’ of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, with which he presented not only as a candidate of the Islamists but all of those who wanted to make the efforts of the rebellion from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypts are today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said the judges in a blue attraction with red crabs clothed in the wooden furnaced chamber, in which he declared the office.
Later Mursi went to the University of Kairo, where he was to hold his call.
He was officially welcomed by a army chapel who played the national hymns he listened to in Habacht.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of presenters in the largest hearing hall of the University with “The Army and the People are a hand”.
The University of Cairo built in 1908 as the Bastion of Secular Education, developed in the 1970s, as a highburg, islamistic student groups.
Mursi put a symbolic odd on the Tahir square on Friday, the birthplace of the Resurrection, the last year led to the end of the authoritarian government of Mubaraks, and praised to recover presidiary power powers taken by the military council from the office.
But with the deposit of the official oath before the court and not as usual before the Parliament, he relys on the military will, which indicates that the military war will continue.
Mursis speaking on the Tahir square was full of dramatic populistic gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On this Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on the morning Saturday evening it continues with a Ü 25-party.
Bold beats and cool sounds are, of course, promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed by heads: severely hurt
A 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed on Thursday during the exchange of a broken outdoor fühler from a head and wounded hard.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to exchange a broken heating feeling at the outdoor facade of a guest house.
When he climbed to the heads of the roof, this way snatched, and the man crashed on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to Salzburg with the rescue-shubschrauber "Thistorus 6".
Improved in South Africa: twice lifelong imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and stimulating of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the dader has been sentenced to twice lifelong on Friday.
This was reported by the sender SABC.
The victim later died from the consequences of severe injuries.
John Kana has been found guilty at the beginning of the week of crime.
The act had triggered a wide range of defeats.
The 21-year-old Anne Booysen had raped in a industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town in February.
14 hours, however, the doctors fighted for the survival of the victim, forgiving.
The view of the young people was so disadvantaged that careers and sisters needed psychological assistance.
During the process Kana had admitted to be in a bar with Booysen in Tatnacht.
He was also able to beat and raped, but he ordered to be responsible for the death of the girl.
At first, the police had gone out of several teasters, but two suspects left from the prison because the evidence did not reach them.
During the procedure, the prosecutor also stressed that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa, rapes are already nearly everyday: some 64 000 ads have been given to sexual violence a year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it is significantly more resident than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa appreciate the darkness of sexual violence but the 10- to 25-fold.

Can sharks that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as the head of the large shark factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the work of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany lovest shrinks," as Jumbo announces black forest paintings.
Only with hair protection and kettle he comes inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect the hands before taking the micro.
Jumbo viewed for reinforcement at fastimbis in Forestshut
"Here I'm working great quantities," the TV machines, black forests shining as a mass product.
1,000 crowns per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat share, color: Uli explains what it comes to quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
TV with level?
Details like the Ph-value of the flesh also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"I'm excited when you mess Roberto Blanco, what's happening," says Jumbo sinically.
Here the level of private TV is presented in pure culture.
But the view is worthy of it.
The viewer sees that the discharge of the crops continues to be handicrafts.
For: Black forests can be found traditionally without bones in the Regal.
The mystery of shinning is the mixture with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoking reminds Jumbo visually of a "U-bot".

20 days in the smoke, the sucks finally make almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the Jumbo," he announces testing.
"This is really delicious," says the facility of the TV star.
This will allow all stakeholders to live.
You thought travel offices belong to the past, thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the year and expected records of holidays in Australia and Britain.
The travel firm now goes out of a renowned annual profit for taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to $305 to 315 million in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are achieved, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record gain of 290.4 million dollars in 2011/12.
As director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half year, especially in Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable, and some of them are in a good way towards record annual revenue before interest and taxes," he explained.
This includes Australia and Britain, which are typically among our most powerful results.
In Australia, the recruitment industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which would be a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly it was good for the Flight Centre leisure business in Britain, while business customers are less spending here.
The US business recovered compared to the seasonal condition of weaker first half year, which is expected for the third year as a result of a profit for the total year.
The shares of Flight Centre increased yesterday by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are stopped for greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammars
In courses of English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic Lyrik and contemporary British Romans from 1914.
The test also provides "unspected texts" input to stimulate more broad reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students need to give a separate GCSE test for language, with strong encouragement to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculums for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first facts that have been transformed radically.
Other core vessels are amended next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Supervisory Authority for Tests, will announce a new organization of the GCSE structures, including a new note system and less course work.
In a summer speech, Minister of Education, Michael Gove said that there is a broad consensus that we must reform our testing system to restore public trust," stressing that the GCSEs would be “required, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent for mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools will receive 138 hours a year and 143 hours a year in Singapore.
Although there will be no formal requirement for more time for mathematics in the hour plan, schools from coalition circles are likely to encourage the comprehensive mathematical test – combined with a stronger weight of the specialist in Ranglists – to apply more hours.
In the training plan, more attention is placed to “the problems of the right life”, including financial mathematics.

When people in the past centuries had too much knew of it and put them on those pictures of heaven and hell, "who prefer our ideas until today", the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes for fullening rather than through a certain embarrassment or even linger.
"The greater hope has been given up by Christian women by religious criticism," says the referent.
They "we have provided us with so many question marks that the call marks seemed to have come off to us."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the trouble of death."
In this way, the question of that sehnsucht is linked, "which is dreaming that everything may be good at the end."

In the magnificent weather, 214 bicycle riders came to Illumensee to manage the round course over the hill chains around the sea.
This informs Ulrich Knobel from the organisational sports association Ilmensee.
Among the participants, especially at the short-distance of more than 15 kilometers and 300 meters, were also many every man's cyclists who wanted to exercise their hobby once in competition atmospheres.
Two Junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good positions at the German Champions.
Both of them were expected to deposit from the field.
Like in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time forward to the goal and defend his title as a total winner of the short date.
On the two place, Pascal Treubel could be placed again.
Theresa Duelli was the team of Albtraum, who created it upstairs at the top of the winner.
On place two and three Anne Adel came from Ilmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A joyful development is the growing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only as regards performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years from the youngest to over 70 years at the oldest launchers.
This year, in the main race, there were even more absolute topathlets at the beginning.

Way through slum, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to deposit village in Kamerun
Bwell and his team spend nearly every weekend dealing with hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “CN Heroes of 2013”.
You can vote for him or for one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose it to "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George's Bwelle saw how his sick father lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was violated near Yaoundé, the capital of Kamerun.
First he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation that extended himself to his brain and caused a haematom that should affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Kamerun," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years to accompany his father in overfilled clinics and hospitals in order to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," commented Bwell.
You can leave the house at five o'clock tomorrow and run to the hospital to be the first one, and isn't the first one.
There are many patients.
Some people die even because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Kamerun there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, so the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most chambers could not visit.
Two of five people in the country live below the poverty limit and nearly three quarters of the health expenditure in the country are private.
“The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered in Bwelle made the decision to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor and works as a vessel surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME that travels to weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008 he and his volunteers have helped almost 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people force in small buses and drive to the villages who need help with the worst medical equipment on the roof.
Not always runs everything smoothly.
More than once they had to move the vehicles through rivers and slaughter.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a festival, singing and dance and the best accommodation to offer the place.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebration and bwell – with its broad smiles and its borderless energy – is pleased to be there at the joyful celebration.
The next morning the team begins with the study of hundreds of patients.
“Pro ride we treat 500 people," says Bwelle.
They come from a round of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekends offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, infancy, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others will receive bridges, borrows or free birth customers – a document necessary for school, but many poor families can't afford themselves.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local offense.
The surgery usually takes place in a school, the cottage or a apartment; after the intake the patients stand up and go in the recreation area to make room for the neighbor.
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is sped by the generator of the group and thus works Bwell and its volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a stressing pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“They drums the whole night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then goes back to the city, tired but proud to the work done.
The group – a mixture of chambers and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free operations last year and knows that it works with its work creates a huge difference for people that helps them.
One man explained that the free operation of a performance break that he got to rework him now.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity, i.e. Bwelle; the rest of private donations.
“I really don’t know when he sleeps,” says Katie O'Malley, who is studying at the Drexel University in Philadelphia Medical and voluntary work in Bwelles Group in the second year.
He is always in the hospital or tried to bring up money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and health care students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwell, this is a chance to collect practical experiences that they would never get at home.
“We can be in operations where we can help to drop blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwell," O'Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon and often bring the gifted sanity material.
But if they are only in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He's a hero without doubt," O'Malley says.
He devoted his life of this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people do not know any limits.
For Bwell, the almost constant work is no burden.
Helping others to live happier and thus fulfill a promise that he has given to his father makes him great joy.
“I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my dad.
I hope he sees what I do.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laugh and to help the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The old man and the sea", is Horst Janson cut on the body.
Janson is himself an old hate in his meteric art.
The old man Santiago can't introduce something when fishing.
So you just add to the two great.
It is almost thought that the folds of the old man who speaks of the fishermen's young manoeuvre can be seen.
When Santiago is tired of life on the chair, that's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fishermen is through and through a character role that is excellently common to Janson.
Hemingway told the history of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willing strength.
Janson is in far routes as a single artist on stage.
He creates it to focus on his attention to the audience so that his monologue is not boring at a moment.
His efforts to eventually draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat before the Fischerdorf.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene into the light: The hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor that sings with her songs and her magnificent voice the life feeling of Cuba.
The four musicians play Kubas Rhythmus and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Ascension to the Romans
At about 120 meters length, under Cologne a wastewater channel from the Roman time has been received.
Who's visiting Cologne's not coming over at the Dome.
Around 157 meters rising the two towers in the heavens and make it the second tower of Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigrane cherry storms without saying that there is a lot to be discovered under the dom.
Rainer Schulze is a expert in Cologne's underworld.
The service center of Cologne tourism is the starting point for his leaders directly at Dom.
The round starts quite unspectacular: "We begin in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a auto-righteous city, so the rest of the old city walls remained just what was not too large.
Most of the users of the parking house are therefore also passing away at the Roman remains and only turn off their car.
But whoever looks closer, discovers a archaeological discovery separated by metal slide in the D2 park.
There are about five meters of high ruins made of handceller size stones to be seen.
"There are rests of the Roman city walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," Schulze recalls.
Before it goes back to the daylight, the participants on the upper parking plane let a glance in a dark 15 meters deep Tray.
This is the fountain of the old Dome, which is hardly observed.
Next station of the tour is the pretoria, and here the participants rise down again into the depth.
We experience here the office of the most powerful man north of the Alps, the President of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as "Stadt Roman Right and City of Agrippinense, founded under Kaiser Claudius in the place of the altar for the Emperorcult".
And the pretoria is the former pretorian palace, the power centre of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman wastewater channel, which is given here to about 120 meters length.
"You can take a piece quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," school is coining the guests.
A surprise still has schoolze.
After picking the key on the cassette, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, charming Tray.
"We are now in the Micwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish congregation built her bathroom deep into the ground to come to the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual washings.
Until today, at the bottom of the mikwe, whose urs go back to the eighteenth century, different waters are available by changing peils of the Rhine.
The mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall for which the construction work should start shortly.
But it will pass for a few years until the finish is completed.
Bean fast cut: Repository of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the Rocker Environment is rerolled after more than four years.
A process of attempting deaths, dangerous physical injuries and damage to two 30-year-olds began before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security arrangements.
The accused ones were silent to the lookup.
They should have been active in the Rockerzene and then heard of the bandidos.
In June 2009, the State Prosecutorship proposes that they, together with unknown complications in Finowfurt, have put in a car three men into a car.
All the victims were seriously hurt, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims should have heard Hells Angels' competing grouping.
One should be a high-level member from Berlin.
It seems to have been a hunting of persecution with several cars before.
According to accusation, the fights of Revier and a power demonstration were about.
The two prosecutors were released in a first procedure at the beginning of 2012.
A speaker then said that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feh.
The daders had worn masks and were not recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof raised the judgment after revision of the prosecutor and rejected it to the Landgericht for the renewed negotiation.
One of the accused ones is currently because of another delicate in open execution.
It was particularly about the reconstruction of the processes in the Tatnacht.
As a witness, the Commissioner at that time was invited.
In the centre, mobile talks of the accused and other persons who had been listening to the police.
Difficulty is that Rocker's in court is almost always keeping a law for them - and not speaking.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been packed out.
State lawyer Stefan Golfier of the State Prosecutor Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new tracks have been raised since the last procedure.
There are eleven further negotiation days for the process.
The roadway society doesn't think
The night was long, music loud and mood well, but sometime it goes home.
Only: in the trees of the people on the rider and retreat seat, the hunger is remarkable.
Clearly, some cocktail or sect may be responsible for this!
What's nearer than chilling to the next drive-in to get a small one?
I don't know, I'd like to be with it in late night and early morning at fast-food-healing.
A few pommes, a cola, a civilian - and then nothing like home and bed!
But on the way home, the apparent differences between me and other hungry disco singers are notable.
For what do you need to miss that you get out of the car window with a sturdy regularity?
Especially on the weekends, paper bags are dispensed on road edges and on parking lots.
"Why?", I wonder.
Are the people too doof to take the suits with home respectively to the next trash?
It is not just so that the paper vehicle sends the landscape.
Tacts have already covered transport facilities such as guide plans and thus triggered accidents.
But she does not even even know what this word actually means.
When you're on the way in the evening, first with several people in the car, you know how a backbank can look infected nights: Klemots, bottles and other towers are there.
There would be no more or less tons, in contrast to the street where no one wants to ruin on the food rests of others.
I already see the day where the cities and municipalities will have to blew out the spaces - and the fast food chains need to demand for their deterioration Pfand.
Obama's withdrawor in health policy
After heavily criticism, President Obama repeated a retreater on his frequent, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people have received an insurance letter, the Republicans warned the President in the last days, he deceived the American public.
Yesterday relativeized Obama his original promise.
"The majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can keep them," he said in Boston's speech.
In response to the numerous media reports on the announcements, Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to take care of themselves on the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than pregnant.
"They come to be a better offer," he said.
The government noted it as little as surprising that the five percent of the people who have completed themselves had to look forward to another tariff, as their contract does not comply with the new standards according to the affordable Care Act.
"I want to tell these Americans very directly: you deserve better," said Sebelius at an hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Representative House in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform has been "mistakeable" since October.
“I am as frustrated and angry as all others,” she said.
I'm determined to get your trust back.
This statement of a sebelius raised to a consultant sitting behind it at the stirring hearing at the representative house was taken after a dispute talk with the Republikan Member Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether they should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question why the “architecture” of the affordable care Act did not have voluntarily refusal to a state-promote insurance in order to complete a price at HealthCare.gov, which they now wanted to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem not confirmed attack on Syrian Air Force
An American government officer who wanted to remain anonymous has claimed on Thursday to CNN that Israeli fighters had attacked an air weapon base in Syrian Latakia a day before.
The goal was "Rakets and related equipment", which the Israeli government feared that they had been determined for the Libanese Hisbollah, said CNN.
Syrian and libanese media as well as the Arab sender Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the support point in the port city of Latakia had been shot on Thursday in the night of Wednesday, and the Israelis was responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, where Russian defenserakets of S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which according to the fact that channel 2 had a range of 35 kilometers and can transport spray caps up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The Government in Jerusalem did not officially confirm the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes a also anonymous Israeli government official with the words that he believed that Israel has done the attack, but is not sure.
In any case, a speaker of the Israeli Defense Ministry said: "We don't comment on these reports".
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already, partly successful, tried to deliver soil-lift racts to Hisbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that every attempt to provide Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons, meaning the surplus of a "red line", which would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented consent that the US spionage was "inappropriately too far"
With an unexpected consent, John Kerry expressed a refusal of the United States' refusal position in relation to its monitoring programmes by saying that spionage was "inappropriately too far".
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching on "autopilot", when the explosive enthusiasms of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden were public about the spionage activities of the NSA.
The U.S. government has come into a diplomatic storm of the decoration of its allies through the throughgoing information.
In a talk given by video connection at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “Only without question, the President and I, as well as others in the government of some things that have expired quasi by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was, what is still going back to the Second War and the difficult years of cold war, and of course, to the 11 September."
Afterwards, he was the first high-level member of the US government that the US spionage exceeded a limit, but also stressed that no rights were abused.
He said: “In some cases the inappropriate has gone too far.”
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore carry out a thorough investigation so that nobody has to feel that there is misuse here.
I assure you that innocent people are not affected in this process.
Kerry, however, claimed that NSA was a power of goodness and has been saved many lives through its monitoring operations.
He added: “We have to do with a new world in which people are ready to spray themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is lacking to kill people, spray into the air and attack governments.
So what would be if you would be able to catch this and stop before it happens?
We have actually prevented airplanes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in the past.
On the other hand, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to distribute the concerns against the supposed American spionage and convince the Europeans of the need to continue working with the United States in the anti-terror relations, as the chairman of the Senat Sub-Committee for European Affairs on Thursday explained.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken with representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was worried about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terror organisations due to the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency.
“It is very important for the United States’ national security interests that Europeans remain on board in terms of our common efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first time in Senat and acted as chairman of the Senat Sub-Committee for Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in a interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make clear that we must continue working together in terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US associations, although the head of the secret service explained this week that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by Nato associations and exchanged with the United States.
Other enthusiasms quoted from documents passed by Snowden, so that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel and up to 34 other national heads worldwide.
The head of national secret services, James Clopper, defended the spionage in bonds as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy told his authority to prepare the trip of the convention to take place this year and hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members should be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being processed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “first words”.
He said that European governments should be honest to their people about the kind of spionage programs that they have used themselves for years.
"While we can change our monitoring programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also find themselves with the fact that we are not the only pioneers," says Murphy.
During the weekend, John Kerry is a trip to the Middle East and to Poland in order to interfere with the wrist over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt, Iran and the U.S. supervisory activities.

Australian penalty against prison in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced in Phuket at 15 days of prison because she had wrongly claimed to be raped by a taxi driver, has been suspended against the judgment and was released on custody.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first sentenced by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false statement after she stated the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped them in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June, while two other men held them.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she was safe to her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket heard Bamford for two days until she was able to have thought of the story.
Until the court negotiations, she was locally held in police.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a prison in a lower level of safety at the edge of Phuket, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy-Liga, who has turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained on Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extreme” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have her back in Australia.
“We of course make great concerns, but we hope that it is home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has lodged against the judgment and is against a cheating of 50.000 Baht on a free foot.
In Australian reports, it was read that she made vacation in the suburb of Krabi in South Thailand.
From the court, it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the profession could also lead to a higher punishment of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of the travel shop woman Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand could be trying to improve his attacked tourist image, and that is why it comes to a volunteer.
