Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as the teherans destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-country solutions should also be discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stressed for years.
Washington criticizes the lasting settlement building of Israel and presents Netanyahu lack of will in the peace process.
By the deal applied by Obama around the Iranian Atomic Programme, the relationship of the two has further deteriorated.
In March, Netanyahu had been invited by the Republicans before the U.S. congress, which was partly appreciated as Affront against Obama.
The talk was not spoken with Obama, a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election at that time in Israel.
In an emergency call Professor to have shot his friend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police' voice that he shot his friend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to show that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Pictureiss and a handwritten note that was criticized on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it clear, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was after information from the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who was traveling in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, was already 300 miles from the school site, where he, according to information from the police, shot and killed a popular story professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that universities have heard shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made the suspicious emergency call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamm took life when the police took it.
One day after shooting in the university, students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to provide a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the medians at both ends of the State, as well as what students and employees who knew it helped them to draw a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Pictureis died, said he didn't have a history of violence or a criminal precautions.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "greatful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both informed in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching body includes 17 members, and many students visited courses from both.
At the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he seemed to be a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to do stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a permit for healthy reasons and said that he had some healthy problem.
This year, he informed only two online courses.
Latest changes in the university employment policy meant that the promotion for the Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute an automatic way to establish as an Assistant professional.
University president William LaForge said he wouldn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "naturally there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
These are questions that can't answer Lamb anymore.
After fleeing from the campus, the police later found Lamb's trace when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistole in the backyard of a house about a milestone south of his home on the border of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogics.
He promoted in the spring in paedagogics.
One of Lamb's long-standing friends called him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said that she was 15 and was 20 when they met by common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool elder guy who tried to train her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the women's heap at that time.
All the girls melted there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson Formstadt of Brandon.
Lamb and Pictureiss were evidently some time together.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no acquaintance of a marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the backstone house that is bound to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was okay.
The Ex-Ehemann of Pictureiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
They and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Bildiss, when he and Abigail came up three years ago, both on a summer year market.
Later they played together some Gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Bildiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminate bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Pictureis Night last night 5 September after Lamb ended his guitar and mouth harmony game before a spacious audience.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
"Please just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and screwed together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of screw.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his brotherhood and student committee.
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people participated on Tuesday evening, including dozens, employees, students and members of the municipality at a kerst light celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwake, while the University School sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The lesson will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that now the police say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that in his emergency call, Lamm called Pictureiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two had ever married.
Toys R us plans to set less work forces for Christmas time
Toys R us says that it will not set as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers an opportunity to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to introduce 40.000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country. In the Christmas period of 2014, 45,000 workers were still set up.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will begin with application talks and increase the number of employees from October to December.
While the holidays are even months away, the Christmas business approaches, and businesses are ready to deposit time workers to pay out shops with employees who sell, send, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox shrinks over his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a major moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were waiting for the Royals in the theatre, and I notice that the seat is empty next to me, and it will gradually clear me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a Trailer for a previous documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and I think I'm a simulated gaze and a length of arms away from being with the Prince of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation about "Back to the Future", presented interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had 30 years ago premiere.
"It's really for me," said Gameberg, "inconsistently the largest time tour film that has ever been rotated."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinema in October.
UN-Chef says there is no military solution in Syria
General Secretary Ban Ki-Mooon says his response to Russia's strengthened military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the nearly five years of lasting conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and elend for millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the Joint Security Council of the UN, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the Five Standing Members of the Council - United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Ministerial Meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the oppressions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this situation unresolvable.
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the management of the crisis in Syria, which they have proved in the achievement of an nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values that show that Donald Trump is to take seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others left him as a joke.
And some wait for a break.
But no matter how some republicans try to get Donald Trump from the upper slopes in surveys, it hasn't worked (now).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Trump in the two-digit field, and some began to seriously ask what it means for the opportunities of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stressed that, at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was released to the upcoming Herman Cain, from which no one country won in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general choice.
But outdoor groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's diversity and start to let their dollar flow to storm him.
Here are some current survey values which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have rotated 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in the middle of June, a survey of Monmouth University showed that only two of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
Until mid July, there were 40 percent.
At the beginning of August there were 52 percent.
Now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three of the ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week has found that 60 percent of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two third of the GOP selectors GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they were either "sponsible" or "sufficient" if Trump would be nominated.
Only two of 10 say they'd be "intimidated" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm like Trump (43 percent say they would be "delighted" for 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in matters enthusiast?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican electors say that they would be "satisfied" or "intimidated" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for its bombastic and political statements, 52 percent of the Irishians tending to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right Temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-elective state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think he has the personality for a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six of 10 independents say that his temperament is not passing into the white house, says ABC/Post.
Republican electors are used to the idea.
When they put up their scholars' guards, Republican Cholers Trump believes real.
If they are asked who first wins the GOP nomination, after a survey of CNN/ORC from last week four of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the date when four of the ten end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full release: GOP choosers did not have the clearest crystal shell in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four of the ten republicans thought that Rick Perry would win nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidates Midt Romney.
Nevertheless, it shows that a variety of GOP selectors Trump's campaign sees as a plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the broken field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidates.
But a survey of Monmouth University early September shows that in a hypothetic head-an-head race between Trump and most other republic candidates, Trump owes the multitude of support.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-on-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who hit him?
Ben Carson would take over the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetic head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald-Trump-Fans say that they have formed their opinion.
A new survey of CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the choosers who support the Trump say that they have firmly forgiven their voices.
Of course, much can happen to change this, and no one can really say that never change the opinion.
46 percent said that they let the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment of the other external sides, the Neurochirurg Ben Carson, but choosers who say they have formed their opinions are twice so often for Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of immigration.
Since Donald Trump has been called "Advancer" in his election campaign two months ago, the immigration was the immigration point in the public discourse at 2016.
Some are worried that the bombastic expression of Trump will retain crucial Hispano Americans from the Republican Party and will harm the reorientation relations.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six of 10 republicans say that they agree with Trump in the case of immigration.
So as long as immigration remains in the framelight, Donald Trump seems to be doing too.
Frustration over the government climbs to new high levels.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson now, about half of the support of republician electors, especially through their external status.
Six of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they would rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry in Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa-republikans are frustrated by the Republicans in the convention, with 54 percent "in satisfaction" and 21 percent "hearted."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
The most expensive living facility is located in the Hobookenweg - with a view over the North Seawatt.
In the street a square metre of a reetdach house costs in cut 73,300 euros.
"To Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says in the study - so the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations cost a square metre most.
Of course, 18,70 Euros per square metre for a student budget in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's Top-Wohn Locations, one of the prizes occurs like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German living locations - with square meters prices in vibrant heights.
There are times several ten thousand euros - per square meters, well aware.
But well, who can do it...
Of course, Munich is not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern-Traumstart thanks to Müller and Götzen
Two-fold tower guards in Piräus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just a walk.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller opened to the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3:0 at Olympic Piräus - then it ran.
A sovereign act of the Champions-League season.
The World Championist Thomas Müller and Mario Götze told the FC Bavarian in the Hexenkessel of Piräus a dream start to the "Mission of Milan".
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won her acting game at the Champions League at the Greek record master of Olympiako in hot atmosphere thanks to Müllers Doublepack (52./90.+2) and idols hit (89.) with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelved launcher orders to be the first step towards finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally take the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
Müller received his 28th meeting in the Champions League to the Bavaria Fighting of the Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who had passed to the World Champions League.
"We won't underestimate them," said Bayern-Kapitän Philipp Lahm before the game in Karaiskakis City before 31.688 hot-bloated fans - and the Munichs held word.
They showed a concentrated and engaged idea without shining.
Piräus had won his last six home games in the King's class, including renowned clubs like Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
==References====External links==
But the Bavarians, in seven Europecup showers with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went courageously to work in their open efforts, but often too infallless.
The attacks were too often initiated on the left-hand side of Costa, who rarely encountered against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more happiness from the right than his flanked from the right half field in the top left torque.
In the 67th minute, the World Championshiper gave the possible 2:0.
The best occasions in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos-Sturmer Ideye Brown hit the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct deduction, the Torwart Roberto pared with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians raised her habited dominant game, Piräus could set nadel stiche.
On gatekeeper Manuel New, however, was released.
For example, when he led a shot of Ideye over the late (56.).
Before new, Guardiola made a four chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng that made it good.
Mario idolate, after musical problems back in the frame, first sat out.
The WM-Held gave green light after the finish training, said Sports Board Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Whoever wants to make something different from it, that is already malicious."
In the first change, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59.).
The idolate came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, with an elephmeter, Müller put up another.
Before the game it came to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly murmured Bavarian fans in their viewer block apparently provoked the followers of the hosts of Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces entered and went against the Münchners.
At least a Bavarian fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
If you smoke, do not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - that's a Potsdame's long-term study.
The good news: Without the risk reduces fast.
Smokingers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This results from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared with non-smoking, the risk of smoking was to lose their teeth prematurely to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 volume.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
Main causes for dental failure are chassis and inflammations of the tooth meat, emphasised the DIfE.
For this parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors show.
Therefore, the relationship between smoking and dental losses goes back to more frequent dental inflammation in smoking.
It is not clear how much smoking also increases the risk for calves.
People who stopped smoking could, however, reduce their risk within a short time, write researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take over ten years until the danger was reduced again to the level of non-smoking, first author Thomas Dietrich explained by the English University of Birmingham.
You must convince people of being non-smoking, said study leader Heiner Boeing from the DIfE: "Smoking reduces lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads after our knowledge to good dental health to high age.
In Germany more than 20 percent of the population of 65 to 74 years of toothlessness are affected, the DIfE reported.
Former studies have already noted that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study undermines the findings.
Archaeologists struck to Cologne Rhineufer to rest from the late race
For several times, the right Rhineufer in Cologne has been made archaeological findings.
Near the construction site for the new Rhineboulevard, Archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum of Skelette and the rest of historical buildings, said Museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians are looking for so-called soil monuments.
In all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a specialist office for Archaeological ground thinking care.
In the third section of the Rhineboulevard, the archaeologists were now completed.
Text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and a church had been established in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the rest of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with some 350 graves was also discovered, which were probably part of the church.

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute on TTIP
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current system for transatlantic free trade TTIP to deterrent the dispute on the planned transatlantic free trade agreement.
The entrepreneurial private lighting facilities for disputes between groups and states are therefore intended to be dissolved by a more transparent system that is significantly more traditional courts in its operation.
"We want to set up a system that trusts the citizens," said the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström on the idea.
The Schwedin has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiation position into the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
The largest free trade zone in the world is TTIP with 800 million people.
The plans for reform of the current separation procedures provide that the EU States and the USA together choose independent judges for a new investment court.
They are intended to come from the EU, the United States and from third countries.
It is also a second instance for the first time.
She would allow it to raise objections against judgments.
So far, the proceedings members agreed to separate judges, an objection against their judgments was not.
In the discussion of the past months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
It would like to work on an International Investment Court after its own information.
There, for example, there could be clarified disputes between Chinese companies and EU States.
The investor state shooting procedures (ISDS) mostly demanded by large groups are considered one of the main reasons for major resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional diversity courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that companies have to contradicted damages from taxpayers, may suspend national laws, or reduce consumer and environmental standards.
In first opinions, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact referred to the proposals of the EU Commission as insufficient.
It was critical that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State, Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress.
The Commission considered essential points in the reform of the Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU Ministers of Trade.
The old system of private divorce courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Company Association of BusinessEurope warned to limit economic complaints through too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged.
When the discussions on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be completed on Wednesday continued unclear.
The negotiations have been running since mid-2013.
The issue of investors protection has not yet been discussed with the USA.
Originally, a framework for the Agreement should already be at the end of this year.
This date shall be considered as unlimitable.
Delicater Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago Sufjan Stevens is sitting on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
In addition to him, a flipchart on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state with Filzstift.
The entire audience, about 40 persons, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells on the basis of several places that he always records on the map, about which his minucious and delicate songs report.
Where they have been created and as it looks like there, in his home.
Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative error.
With the third album "Gretings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" published in 2003, sound-composered songs appear, which are harmoniously close to the American folk of late Sechians, but at all times in the great drift.
It creates the smell, "Michigan" would be the first part of a moving series: each of the 50 States of the United States should be sang as a result.
But already 2004 and Rhinenahe has already appeared "Seven Swans" and sets some expectations positively.
Reduced Stevens gets up here.
Live enough for him Gitarr and Banjo.
One year later, the musician living in New York returnes to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinise") in 2005, a surface-covered featuring masterpiece appears.
Overborder ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album rises into the American Billboard charts and does not lack in the annual best list of influential music media.
After excessively productive experiments Stevens is then used on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic movement pieces.
This sixth ordential studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
During the smaller clubs, the stage shows here will become the colorful spectacle of Neon star bands and large fluorescent stage dance.
Current tours Sufjan Stevens as part of a five-headed band through Germany.
In the dark, Hamburg's More!
Theatre is mainly presenting the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although here now nearly 2000 guests are bound to sit in their chairs, the more clearly mature Stevens return to the intimacy and folk.
Without directing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you can hear that the lecture is "opulent" and so you can throw the "place out of Grund".
First of all, Steven's modest commission, plays acousticly a few older songs and finally renews his applause.
Jeremy Corbyns Debüt at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr. Corbyns Debüt will be expected with tension at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister.
The new Labour President Jeremy Corbyn is supposed to give his debut at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister and first bring up with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will raise in order to examine the first of his six questions, shortly after lunch, its performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour departments.
He called "less theatre and more facts" on this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them colleagues.
The meeting will be the first Parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it comes after his appointment to the member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech on the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chair, on Tuesday during the singing of the National Hymn at a Memorial on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has provoked criticism of a number of tory MPs and is focused on several title sides in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn has drawn attention
A speaker of Mr Corbyn said he had "standed in a respectful silence" and recognized the "Heldentum of Royal Air Force in the air slaughter around England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme, he advised the Labour chairman to sing the national hymns, "independent" of his faith that the Monarchy was to be cut off.
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they appealed to differences in economic, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as leader.
The political code of BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stapels" within Labour according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position to the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn said the TUC conference that Labour would make changes to remove the entire idea of a limitation in total.
For hours later, Mr Smith said the shadow of work and pension ministers that the party was "clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26.000 dollars to 23,000 dollars.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chair, David Cameron since he is Tory Chief, over the dispatch box in Parliament.
The Labour Chair, who has promised another policy approach, says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given him more than 30.000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the questionnaire of the Prime Minister is too confrontative and that he will be suspended both "suitability" and the disputes with contradictions, instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of economic ministers, will represent him if he does not take part, for example, if Mr Cameron is going abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the word, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the Subhouse, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove from the policy in the style of a "Casperle-Theater", which is often associated with the questionnaire of the Prime Minister, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
As it was first sent in 1990 in television, the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was considered to be the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the subhouse and his position among its parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it became a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Schosses in Joburg: Obdachless youth trained for photographers

"I was shot in Joburg" (I was held in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that informs obdachless youths about how they take photos from their surroundings and achieve a profit.
BBC News has taken one of the first graduates of the project.

Pfund increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound is rising by data that show an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom. In parallel with this, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller's target.
Between May and July, the result grew by 2.9% compared to the same previous period without bonuses in the United Kingdom.
This percentage has been the fastest and more estimated over the time of an increase in interest since 2009.
The pound increased by more than 1 % compared to dollars to $1.5505 and was climbed to €0.84% compared to euro 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase by 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a break of 20% after the consignment of the Rivalen AB InBev entered.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch together.
Burberry acts were more richemont 0.9% higher after encouraging messages from the competition group for luxury goods.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that the sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reported again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining industry said that he had taken $2.5 billion through an share sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had set its assessment for the company rating on "Sales".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages risked expansion.
The Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing force will compensate the higher cost of work in his company, he says.
The costs could meet the JD Sports expansion plans, he added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Läppical 21 years young, a hemp with a thigh fresco.
The type of platinum bleeding hair is 100 million euros.
Even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation of U17 turns through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Below Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
But since 7 p.m. the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone plate form of Berlin luxury hotel at the Potsdamer place.
The Bieber-Bau: She lives here Idol, whose poster is hanging up in Stettin since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs exactly as much as its mom Ewa deserves half a year.
If any.
They say: "Of course my Wiktoria should sit in the tenth class at the Gymnasium."
"I'm having her a dream."
School obligation?
Who juckt it?
The fans aren't.
Not even beeber itself.
He's still cared for.
For the reclame in the advertising prepause of the superbowl, he got three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel irma was spurred many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And with every pope that looks like it and over the shop table, Bieber also boxes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you stand on the window disc.
More than 100 million he should have used this way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Beeber was finally in the United States and Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Byeber itself, whose fourth album is supposed to follow in November, the many zeros do not first interest.
At least he's doing that.
Pegida Plant brings libanes on Kartoffeldön-Idea
Kartoffelns or dunnes?
It is both in the Kartoffeldener who developed by the Oldenburger Imbis owner Hani Alhay.
Inspirated by the speech "Cartoffel instead of Duner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay potato and meat have been put together on a spider.
On the idea, a poster brought him at a Pegida demonstration with the notation "Cartoffels instead of dunner", which he would have seen randomly in TV.
Since then, a barbecue is turned in his store, which has been sticked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculty for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now led to the Libanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a pattern of use after information from the Authority.
How much meat and how much potatoes the spies contain, Alhay does not therefore want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes together even better," he finds.
The culinary national consultation also comes well with his customers.
Metcash starts soil resistance campaign to combat Aldi incident
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA complexes from an aldi-Opmarsch in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food-Großhändler Metcash has started a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA individual dealers in South Australia and Western Australia before a $7,7 million aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA-Super markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and builds the IGA brand by Mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well as events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice manufacturers Simmo from Dunsborough, distributing samples in IGA shop owners, selling charged tickets for South Australian footballliga to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the whole dealer conducts his annual investors strategy day.
It's a lot on the game, since South Australia and Western Australia make nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGAladen shops and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are renowned provincial and IGA individual dealers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analytics such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will cut away twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries and remove all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, the Analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA individual dealers could lose 360 $ million sales per year and Metcash 250 million dollars to end 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and the amounts on metcash's high fixed cost could cost Metcash about $13 million profit from interest rates and taxes, Mr. Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the Eastern States, mainly Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey from Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8% in 2016, by 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the leading Fund Manager Hamish Connorss, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Munros' comments.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash's board has contacted Mr. Munro's last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and withcash's food and food trade imports, which provides approximately 1.200 IGA individual dealers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reductions in the same pressure on sales and margins.
However, the whole dealer refuses and invests more than 150 million dollars to improve sales prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products every week and provide IGA individual dealers with improving their shops by rapidly growing fresh food and a better selection of private label food.
Metcash's main business leader Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop rehabilitation programs will be made to Elan and hope that the whole dealer will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennisverband Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "Collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the President of the Australian Tennisverband Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is always called "Special Ks", led by the intimidated conflict of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters to the Rampenlight.
In a frightened skill in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the skudder, while Harrison exclaimed: "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
During the last time he was seen as he was scattered by a tennis hit after a potential US-open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth around the second place behind Bernard Tomic in Davis-Calbfinale against Britain.
"One thing about which I quite elapse is the fact that, according to my view, Thanasi was taken a little into the dispute," Healy said.
He has broken a slander when he lost in the U.S. open, but he is not the first player who has broken a slander of frust with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he isn't proud to it.
But, really, he did very well in the US opening, even under the quite provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much recognition.
He has a great team around himself, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too strict.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the outdoor area, he is trained hard, he is good in the form, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own services.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios in the important pre-decision that starts on Friday, and he describes the "general decision" as the right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term solid component."
"First, we wish the team is fully concentrated on competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has made very quickly the rise, which people like Federer and Murray have noted. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understandable the consequences of his action. Some time outside the frame light, where he can think about it, I think for appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
European refugee crisis: Hungary explains emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and retired the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illegally into the country.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered together in a non-governmental country and Serbian officials responded with embarrassment.
The people fleeing before violence stood firmly on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents there and left down there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police robber swept over them, the migrants scanned "Opening the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian long-term police.
Some show from protest food and water.
Serbia’s Foreign Minister stated that it was "inacceptable" that migrants were sent back from Hungary, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived.
(Serbien) wants to be part of the solution and not a security harm.
In the coming days, conversations with Brussels and other countries have to take place," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border did not comply with a common immigration policy at a striking meeting in Brussels for one day after the 28-nation block.
The Ministers agreed, however, to share the responsibility for 40 000 people who were looking for in the excessive Italian and Greece. They expressed their hope that, next month or end of the year, a agreement would be reached that the EU States would take another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent on Tuesday.
However, Hungary did not look to a short action by Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday emergency in two southern regions, the authorities gave more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could lock roads and speed asylum procedures.
The Hongary Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a stalk drahtzaun along its border to Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country, after it ended a magic at the Serbian border.
CBS News Championship Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners have been used in the race to create the stagger wirh-saun between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant enpassage for many war refugees from Syria and, on the other hand, in the Middle East and in the European Union.
However, President-in-Office of Viktor Orban has proved that most incoming economic refugees are looking for better life and not war refugees who have the right to protect - a view that is strongly in conflict with other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws which entered into force around midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 meters (13 foot) high magnitude that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia a crime. These laws also set up higher liabilitys for sentenced human dealers.
"Due to the situation created by the mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the emergency," said government speaker Zoltan Kovacs Reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say very clearly: Illegal border transition is a crime.
The Parliament has to agree with the use of the military that is expected for the next week, but reporters of Associated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for a day at the border.
Gyorgy Bakondi, National Security Advisor for Orban, said that authorities were about 45 people when attempting to cross the border, 15 others were already deeper into the country.
They come through by harming the tower, they are now in police and are accused of the surgery of crimes according to the new laws.
Authorities are quick to repair the magic.
Hungaryn officials also joined two of the seven border transitions with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with stahl wirt to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important cross-border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and pressed a amount of people to push in there.
Approximately 20 were able to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to go to Hungary.
Vote-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead before Bernie Sanders halfed in national survey
The former US Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the democratic race around the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her toward the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic choosers in pre-electors (58 percent before), while Sanders are second, with 27 percent (as of 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is in charge of the Presidential office, will support 15 percent of the democratic choosers of preferential elections.
More than five months before the beginning of the preliminary elections, most democratic choosers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is firmly fixed on which candidates will support them.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demografic groups, while Sanders achieved some gains.
Clinton holds a great preface with women and moderated ones, but these predictions have been reduced.
Their support for the men is significantly diminished, and Sanders is only back here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic electors under the age of 50 has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, has a great lead to the older electors.
In the last month, Clinton was a two-digit leap with the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point frontition with this group.
About half of the democratic electors of the preferentials countrywide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support it with some preservation and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Perhaps not surprised that Clinton's current supporters are especially excited by her.
The views are more mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would be enthusiastic.
While 48 percent of the democratic choosers of pre-electives say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less republic choosers say this about their candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporter is asked in an open question why she wants to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the opinion that it is time for a woman to become President (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Advocate to deal with problems and choosability will also be quoted.
Since the Vice-President puts a potential for the Presidential office into the scale, 57 percent of the democratic pre-electors want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it.
If democratic electors are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
By Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to candidate democracy for the nomination of democracy, Hillary Clinton's lead before Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in race.
Five and fifty percent of the democratic choosers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the choice; but this number of 78 percent has fallen in the last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement with distance, but the percentage that looks at it as the "suitablest" has risen.
However, in the following question, what is important for a candidate, democratic chooser calls questions about ability to choose.
Like in the last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these preferential electories has been unacceptable.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in some important characteristics in the preferential elections of their party.
Most of them consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong lead qualitys.
Biden cuts the best with the three candidates from honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Third percent of the democratic electors do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice so many say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him.
Democratic preferential choosers generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic electors have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions on Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are continued to be asked as minister of Foreign Affairs, most democratic choosers of preferential elections are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in all.
But it is another story in the U.S. public in all.
The half of the Americans are now in satisfaction with their declaration, while only about one third is satisfied.
The public opinion to this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that her opinion has even worsened her opinion.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered by the choosers of their party to be honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for them under registered choosers in total: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62 per cent of the vows do not consider a honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the country's elections also see Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good noises at leadership.
By the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush cut the best with honesty.
A majority view Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic selectors in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson goes near Donald Trump at countrywide survey
Ben Carson is located at the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now dismiss half of the support of the voters in the new survey, and others lose dramatically
Republican electors continue to support Trump across the country. Support grows from 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
However, Carson shot in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also revealed that Carson gets well at demografic groups and overthrows Trump among republician electors with academic education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio-Gouverneur John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin's governor Scott Walker, who has fallen most deeply, from 10% support in the last month to 2%.
The former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, is 6% on the third place.
The error margin at the sample of 376 people from Republican electors in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6 % and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson rises in the survey - he lands 19% support for the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a look at a carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side hibe for the former neuro surgeons, even after Carson was excused to question Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa.

Five members of the brotherhood charged the death of a Baruch College Newling
Nearly two years after a student died during a shy ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, Mordanklagen are submitted to five people.
Members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Brudership took Chun "Michael" deng in September 2013 brutal and desperated his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, told the police.
Officials said that he was charged with connected eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked, while he tried to go over a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headache, then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi-broadership did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng was unauthorized and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothing, to smell his symptoms and Andy Meng to contact the national president of the brotherhood to get advice, policeman Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"On this point, the members began to hide Utensilien and put the well-being of the brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be revived, and he died on his injuries next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added to head, rough and upper squeeze with stupid forces.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the shanes of the brotherhood. At least one student dies every year since 1970 at the Shicans," said periodicals Fierberg, an lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a declaration.
Brotherhoods and their members must be drawn to account, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County of Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a complaint for the third degree of murder for the first five members.
Two-and-third members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of criminal union because of scary attacks and training.
"We do not only want to make the involved persons responsible, but if there is an organization that has - officially or inofficially - this is sanctified, we will also draw them into account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its contraction to the local group.
This will happen when Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest will come, and the houses will be raising, funds for bonds will rise, and the economy will go into a recession.
We know.
What we don't know is how long this will last and how long it will stop.
In particular, the history of the economy offers only little guidance to the end.
A recession came within 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, although not always, a factor of how the economy and the financial investments react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on increasing interest rates, rather than on the period required for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market participants may find that the total excitement may have been overwhelmed because of an interest increase.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis is being interpreted uncertainly by some as a signal for the end of the "billy money"," said Julian Jessop, head of the capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US tins to normal heights but still to be low to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the prevention of interest increases can make things for a while volatil.
Once the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that assets are deprived of 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy", said German bank analytics in a new study of what happens according to interest increases.
In fact, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly upward - approximately 14 percent - on the way to increase interest, quite smooth in the 250 days afterwards (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal condition after 500 days, with an average rate in the last six past cycles of 14,4 percent according to a current analysis which published Bob Doll, Chef Anlage-Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return starts to reduce itself.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the present case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not have before and could accelerate a recession.
First remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP less than 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, only a few expects that will last and expect for the third quarter following that of Atlanta Fed only 1.5 per cent.
Interest increases in such fragile economic clauses could be riskant and cast up the question "if it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have made the whole year to an increase in the rate of the Fed, and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many stratoes and economists believe that the FOMC could authorise an increase in this session, the future trade is only a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing vibration in the GDP, and pre-recession heights have made very quickly after the start of recreation in the shadow," the report says.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow restoration of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is nearly the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is now 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatil, since the market is taking a interest increase, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the Rendits seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/ reduction in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the increase cycle, the creditors immediately fall, said the Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab's Stress believes that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer collapse between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a deflation of the curve.
High-renal bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analysis at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"Only the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy" she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the earnings curve is more flat, credit margins have expanded and volatility has risen – all characteristics of the market if the Fed intensifies its strategy.
Largely, companies who develop the greater part of their business in the United States will benefit from when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse, as an increase in dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts.
"The history shows that "quality-" shares tend to respond to three months after an initial interest increase," said Goldman Sachs analytics in a customer report.
Companies with strong balance have exceeded 5 percentage points, according to each of the rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Company with high capital rates and lower volatility in their shares also exceeded their pendants with lower quality by average 4 ( percentage points) and 3 ( percentage points).
Debts will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most, said Goldman.
Apart from the pure share games, consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollar.
Sparers could see profits through higher earnings even if experts are different opinions of how quickly this will take place.

BBC Radio 3 "wandels" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the sender, to prove that he does something that the privater does not.
The Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio-sender is "deadure" and is increasingly no longer to distinguish from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "doom" - but it seems to change to Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be only under another name.
So, if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously called examples with which you actually imitate only what is already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director-General pointed back the prerequisites and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far before his commercial competitor when it comes to live music and enlightenment of the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will learn about classical music nowhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really inadequate.
"And to find the commitment of Radio 3, and to order new works, I think also really important," he said.
In the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that he had to work harder to engage in the audience as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of the BBC production, which, during the hearing of the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sports, led to the fire of entering the commercial rivals.
The Tory-Decorated Damin Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of BBC, who was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £.
See why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly martyrous?
Lord Hall said that the BBC 1 show was produced with Paloma Faith and Boy George as Judge - "on special BBC-Weise".
He added that he wished that the company "find a hit from our home pile" when it next time starts a conversation series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or devote money from the taxpayers for other entertainment formats.
Internet changes increased the slowest in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven percent increases in online sales.
Last month, the lowest result has been since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobiles to buy
Experts believe that the Black Friday has broken the expenditure in November
For more than a decade, the virtual shopping has treen, and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have changed into spirit cities.
However, experts say that there are signs now that online revenues stagnate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales stagnate after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back until 2000, then this has always developed," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to operate with their mobile purchases.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the Sofa.
But now this is going on, and we may experience the reduction of growth.
The Black-Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is quoted as a reason for the detaching turnovers.
Experts believe that buyers retain their purchases before this event, which takes place on last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers around their computers sharked to make their snippets, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fighted for snails, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium discovered that 5 £ expenditure was spending a little more than 1 £.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the centres.
Muslims bury those who are killed in Mekka at the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctified
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse partly of the huge Saudi bin-load group
The Ministry of Health said that in total 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed on Mekkas Großmoshee.
Dearly filled, largely dressed in white, the route to suspend their respect when the first of the dead attracted their last trip to the Al-Moaissem-Friedhof.
The sad procession went over at the Holy Place, where only days before a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the beds.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi royal depended on a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that also left 394 injuries.
The bodies of 29 berries who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque Mekkas were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Great Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrim journey when the crane crashed down.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the year's Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officers have already stated that Haddsch will continue to Mekka with thousands that will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the bin-load group should not have left the arm of the crane when he was not used.
An Arab version of the Decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin-Laden Group is responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of foreign travel was prohibited.
At the beginning of this week, Salman praised to reveal what caused the sturz of the crane that crashed into a large mosque court where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before Haddsch, who later took place in this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse de Krans, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also tadeled the group for non-current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Thousands of crowns surround Mekkas Großmoschee as part of the massive construction project led by the bin-load group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected with Saudi Arabia's family for decades and takes larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an abbreviated son, who was uncovered by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrim journey, which is at least once necessary in the life of every healthy muslim.
Officials said that 158 people were staying in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (174.000) are paid to the members of the dead and the same sum of permanent injuries.
Other infringements will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says that the time of the cheap Eastern European craftsman is over
Britain employs more and more craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified crafts from Eastern Europe has risen behind
This leads to opening 200 other skrewfix shops targeted on crafts
At the same time Kingfisher 60 B&Q sales sites will be closed across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Championship of Daily Mail
It is claimed that British lay down their hemmers and brushs in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen performing the work in their homes
If you are able to deal with a hammer or a brush to lay walls, you seem to be a minority today.
Because Britain employs more and more craftsmen to perform homeworkers in their homes, the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new Managing Director of Kingfisher, who owns the Construction Market Chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified crafts from Eastern Europe that services were now overridden at deepest prices.
Kingfisher therefore plans to open 200 other Screwfix shops that direct themselves on craftsmen and to close 60 sales sites of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said that they want to take more women in B & Q stores, because eight of ten purchase decisions are taken by women in the shop.
At the moment, the men are overwhelmed with the employees.
She said that it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We need to move this more to a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of five women at the top of a British company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also transformed her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs. Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is here an important issue.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher mentioned a decrease in half-year profit and sales after the group trained the costs for the closing of the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who has Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Functionary of Aich/Dob because of unfaithfulness before court
On Wednesday, two functionaries of the Austrian Volleyball Championist Aich/Dob have to be responsible for untreue and tax retreatment.
The accused weren't guilty.
One of them was also accused of office abuse.
He has been spoken free of charge in May.
The current process has been dealt with.
According to the President-in-Office Robert Riffel, in the pre-examination, the accused ones had been expelled to use money from association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011, which they were allowed to dispose of their functions for private purposes.
It's about 40,000 euros for the damage.
Sports functioners are also accused of financial affairs.
The President of the Schöffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin, was distributed.
It is intended to be negotiated at a later time.
For the purposes of the insurrection, the defense suggested that the association had not been a disadvantage at any time.
The sports functionaries would have calculated only effort damages, and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and where they had invested much time and money were exported from the debts - the passives were around 60,000 shilling in 2001 (d.h. 44,000 euros).
"Then we were faced with the situation: Do we continue or lock the club?", told one of the accused, in the major business auditor of the Financial Office.
He then decided to take this task with his colleague and fellow Members.
With all risks.
"We have foreseen money, put our life insurance as a security at the bank," he said when he was inclined.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, it must only be made no debts.
In addition, in the case of appropriate financial success, the payment of effort damages has been decided to be reduced until 1991.
Therefore, one part of the effort damages have been paid out for years later, from 2003 on the account when a Plus had been on the account.
Therefore, the former Obmann explained the transactions as well as not detail bookings.
The accounts and saving books managed the two prosecutors together, said the second accused.
The judge asked why the payments were not fully opened to the association.
The association has not been interested in the detail of the financial statement, that only the freedom of debt was important, is the answer.
When a functionary investigation began in 2011 for office abuse, a amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
These were repositors, the accused.
This securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known by the association in accordance with its statement.
"Why?", the judge wanted to know.
The questioned had long no answer.
Then he finally meant that he believed that this was the best for the association.
If something happened to him, no one would know anything about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The fellow prosecutor had been informed, justified by the functionary.
This transfer was formed as a damage reimbursement.
Why damage?, judge and lawyer wanted to know.
The first accused that he had not agreed with this formulation because the association had never been damaged.
But what shall I do when the lawyer says, "With this you are all out of the cutter."
"I am a legal representative?" he asked.
The functioner also said that he never paid a cent bill, he calculated only kilometers of money and diets.
He added to the association 1.000 euros per month, however, the actual effort was much higher.
Exact documents for the early years could not present the accused ones.
These were no longer preserved after an operational test in which everything had been considered correctly, they explained.

All the records were in bar, so he had to drive from his residential site to Bleiburg from the People's Market to the Bank, he explained in his statement.
The main negotiations will continue on 23 September with the survey of Witnesses.
Hewlett packard stresses further 30.000 jobs
In addition to the staff running for three years, computerriese will build further jobs in the company's oppression.

Time of decision on interest rates for the US note bank
The world observes when the US note bank comes together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether the interest rates are raised for the first time since almost a decade or not.
An survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that was still the last week that Fed will do this now think the Fed will continue to last a bit longer and keep the interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It's an historical event because it's seven years ago since the Fed's interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, leader of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is added to the balance and generates only a low inflation on a relatively good performance level.
However, Fed cannot ignore the less red view of global conditions.
It warned the markets to increase, but the signs suggest that opportunities are good against such a step.
Decision to be announced at 20.00 a.m. on Thursday
Death Protection at the Delta State University forbids excuses
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it was "leading" in the first murder and "he could make it unfailing," said authorities on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a lecturer for geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University, appeals to emergency number by 10:00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot on someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the employer of the emergency centre that the police had to send to his home.
He said "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will be stirred," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb did not give a statement for his shots.
When police betrayed the scene, they found the body of Amy Pictureiss, 41, and a man-writing note of Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening, when policemen surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he wouldn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "naturally there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb supposedly believed that Bildiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there are "no information, no evidence" for a "dreieck relationship".
Pictureiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who declared that they were married about seven years as a "good man".
The two have been done 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Pictureiss had a daughter 19 and she'd be "devastated on the ground."
He said that Pictureis's daughter was "absolute best friends."
Pictureiss worked online from home, according to the statement of Linsday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Pictureiss.
Knowles said that Pictureiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had met Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "he's not going to prison."
When police took him on the highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb went to the side of his car, flew at foot, went into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University in spring 2015, as his lifelau suggests on the University's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky donors
The actress (left), in picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressy years.
In 2001 he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actress is also supposed to fight with drugs, and in 2008 he was condemned for drug ownership.
All that certainly calls for his tribut.
Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the Group
The Lufthansa plants a large group of companies.
A half billion euros per year want to save the Lufthansa group alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's around 1000 leaders will cost the workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with pilot work.
The Lufthansa transforms its company structure and develops Eurowings Billigtochters.
The objective of the reorientation was a contribution of about 500 million euros per year from cost and loss of synagogue, and the airline reported on Wednesday.
Among other things, there is no board for passenger business in the Lufthansa in the future.
The Eurowings Airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In the Chief Team of Chef Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
With the new composition, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group wants to arrive against Ryanair and Easyjet in future.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex.
The airlines operated under the roof of the Airline Group, which set three quarters of the annual revenue of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the Pilot Union Cockpit (VC) the negotiations will be resumed after the legally stopped strike on this Thursday.
This was participating in the trade union.
The topic of discussion is to be the restoration scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants "in a year with a prognosted recording result" to come as soon as possible to tragic results.
The conflict between trade union and Airline led to various strikes in the past months.
The background is the saving concept "Wings".
In the fight against competition routes, Lufthansa looks like the merger of Eurowing's bill line.
Under the title "Morgenzug to the south" paintings of Leena Krüger are seen in the artist house.
The Finnin, who has long attended in Göttingen, has compiled a selection of titleless works for the White Hall of the House, which animate their viewer to give thanks to travel.
Luke Shaw by Manchester United can't play monate long because of double fracturer
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracturer of his right leg at the Champions-League deposit of Manchester at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left foreign defender to wine and will exclude it for at least six months from the game, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The infringement was caused by a countless attack of Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw was broken into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the game field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double legfracture and is in the hospital."
He's being moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, has it very difficult and then plays fantastic, and then this happens.
In the cabin, he had a oxygen mask.
He wept.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then this takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to be a red card and a elephmetr decorated.
Nicola Rizzoli, the divorce judge, has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian Shider had wronged.
You can assess for yourself when I say that an elephmeter and a red card were random.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account was: "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how misunderstood I am, my way to healing begins now, I come back again."
On this basis: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the lower rate of PSV
The United Kingdom defender has an additional stimulus with the European Championship in France to recover until the next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injuries."
When a player with this kind of infringement leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our player to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland company at the WM 2014.
"He's doing very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you hear it is a very bad injuries, it's not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction so it looked like he had touched [Moreno], but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a foul game by Chris Kleining.
Surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book it will not last long until you know it almost out.
Unless you're perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to call his favourite children's book, the President of the Minister for The Lorax, published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the SuperCamp's website, and continues: "Lightly, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my children because it seems to be an image or a message that we have missed before."
Everything beautifully and well, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the act of the book, gives back an indication of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to extend the quite short original text.
"In the midst of the surrounding town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is gone and even the air is a product, a boy named Ted hoping to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by having their desire to see a real tree," they read. A loved interest was Dr. Seus, whose right name Theodor Seus's Geisel was and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this would not be suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax movie that is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins: "In the surrounding town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a product, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, to win the girl of his dreams."
Although he gives yes to be a beautiful father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar to the work of the book. Here a unnamed boy, such as the local environment is falling through the money-good trees, Thneed striking once-lears despite the protests of the namely lorax, a hocking, snorrowing being, "who speaks in the name of the trees," is devastated.
Most likely such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read 20 times after each other a child.
A downing-speak-speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron employees but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England's team, but it is still difficult
To skip to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, a difficult task is, but if you select the border that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outgoing victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting job, and the Community spirit is strong; they will not be wearing fools of 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as Spin-Bowler and Adilkkah, even if it represents an unknown size on test level, a option for the attack is.
The message relating to this: Adam Lyth separates from the England Test Chad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head trainer in Yorkshire to analyse.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that led to nomination, because - and I said this before - players are their own best choice.
For a long time, you would have extended Lyth's course, but he had control of his own fate.
If he hopes to find out further runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
The England Trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even if he did not provide such good performances, and this does not surprise me; he is especially a team man.
The question of how much time a test sponsor gets to put his signs is difficult.
Lyth got seven opportunities - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and outward.
The only object you can raise was that England first inserted Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was the highest - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales's coming in, and he's a guy I appreciate.
He's a X factor cricket player, which we saw in Yorkshire early in this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place that hit us very much.
It must at least receive the same opportunities as those before him, but of course this depends on the crew in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to beat Moeen next to Cook, which would bring an extra spider, and get four quicks, raised up, and I don't have anything on it.
I don't see why a strokeman can't beat there, and these left hands have already shown that he's a devil church of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he came to open in 2001.
He's done three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the frame as a back-up spinner, and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man.
People may view their statistics - average 31 with the sleeper and 35 with the ball - and think it is a point, but there are no large number of backup spectators that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Unless of the team, England has made a few clever supplements at the trainer tab.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games might be a master coup.
He is one of the most nice guys of the game that will bring a full of experiences, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball footage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for international cricket competition, as a player or coach, and as Mahela, he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the cloaky cabin, even if the messages are in line with the previously said.
Collys Team College at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team makers do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easy.
The Brexit Lager (Brexit = exit from the EU of Britain) could gain an increase if the economy is in a flute until 2017
David Cameron's unequivocal new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be more difficult every day, even without the choice of the gentle Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn is a leader of Labour or the TUC who is seriously crushed for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreign countries also have their corbs and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said newly that some Member States, so deeply scattered in various crisiss, as the EU is now and not always satisfactory from their own debt, Britain's self-created agenda with divided contract agreements and distorting contract changes they mostly do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they were threatening social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Ministers and Ministers of Finance climb at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, come home and say that they win associations for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't let us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to some major cities until the point where they are unlike whether we are staying or going.
Germany’s cautiously sophisticated Chancellor Angela Merkel is an alliance, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it happened to the overdrown long endurances such as Thatcher (11 years), Midterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frances François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a blashing force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to suggest that they will get out of a leg in order to help self-bretts whose energy should be used better for preventing Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want because most of them have similar separateist trends.
Therefore, some of these ministers may plan to speed up the Brexit process, especially in the SNP style, while UK referendum campaign 2017, suspects my friend.
"The renewal was a plead" and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renewal."
The Europeans know how roughly the Fleet Street can be at their costs and which EU creatures are the Oligarchy of the press barones, as they were it during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, but were not supported by our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro-Opportunists who made a name as a "EU-Gerade-Banane" Brussels friend in the early 90s.
In all his defence Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This was part of the Medley of tax-fearning shocks, telephone-hacking foreigners and the Pseudo non-inlanders, who have most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was similar to her, but found that if you were sitting in a cheese with a hot gorilla, you were distributed to better bananas, instead of being a lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he resisted Camerons referendumswirbel, because Blair had put the principle about the unaccepted constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch electors in 2005, which opened him with a back door.
The press has never moved this to him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly clap on the back on Monday in West Minster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me to forgive - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boykott Murdoch Strategy of the 80 years, a mistake and today.
It can last, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position to Europe is - I express it friendly - in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional blue-coloured tendency and the wilder filths of Tory's small-englandism can probably say yes.
It's what Hilary "A benn, but not a Bennite" Benn in the radio and TV said this week when the pathfinder fighted in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provoking John McDonnell was a bad idea as a shadow Chancell.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father in TV tried to be illoyal to be his Labour cabinet colleague without going too far and lose his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, yet what JC told his contests and Members after all reports on their clause meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the stimulant bottom-up image of Corbyn wants - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and, before all things, in the strudel of social media, a fountain of Paranoia and betray.
It is right to avoid giving Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep laborators' support in the referendum campaign for a sensibleness, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks like that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic multi-declarations on EU membership - in line with their bennite motion economy, their anti-kapitalistic past - are no longer a question of the esoterical discussion under left dissidents for which the narzissmus of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its multi-declarations to the Nato - Tom Watson, it is firmly convinced that JC does not start a campaign for exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their supervisors at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin constituent political capital - they have also mistrayal choosers - to make concessions to the Britain if this can be all inappropriate?
The United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded by something that is called British Influence Security Forum at the beginning of Monday.
Experts criticize report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Protests of a stately financed agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smokes originated from a meeting of 12 persons, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who wrote in British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Grundsatz Report" last month and described it as a "assuming review of evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the taxability of the data and point out the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "except windy basis" on the PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expect PHE’s claim that "the present best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smokes" based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been called to develop a model for a multi-critical decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) in order to lead their opinions on the harm of different Nikotin-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were compiled in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose manager should have received a independent study of British American Tobacco funds (BAT).
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the financing he was supposed to have received after reports before from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting members of the body are not provided, but there are several well-known e-cigarette chips, some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their know-how in the Tabak control.
The PHE took part in the meeting.
The research work of the group "is significant" that there is a lack of "heart evidence for the damages of most products at most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
None of these connections or restrictions will, however, be discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE have not been given evidence that e-cigarettes have been disturbed as a way to smoke for children or non-smoking.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been answered before.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smokes."
Every second lifelong smoker dies in his supplication.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence has and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people die every year in a illness of smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion dollars per year.
By making clear proof that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking, we meet our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would give their right arm for Hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the radio fee should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK senders.
He criticized the BBC that they should place public-law programs that are probably seen by a smaller audience in hardly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and senders like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried to get in contact with the BBC in his time at Channel 4 without success for six years.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC will give or send programs that would also be clearly shown by non-proventioned rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus-Kommunikation Committee in the context of his investigation on the future of BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee that I do not think in the medium or long term of a good idea, you should at least make its production on programs that do not make others or commission.
You are sending The Voice in a top time window because they want to reach the most wide support for their future.
The idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke, it's crazy, it's naturally insane.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressional tax programmes that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, as well as both own productions.
In fact, other channels would give their right arm for this.
I am trying to see how this should be public-law TV.
I don't think this would be the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC blame was "for the ambitions of people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular missions of the BBC reflect what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, said in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC Shows should sell such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law notes programs "to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience, but they meet their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their hypocrisy missions to justify 4 billion dollars of radio fees, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one wanted to see them ever.
As regards radio fees, Johnson said to the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressional system in terms of conditions which can receive the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year here, but for people who are a lot of money for 150 £, ask me if that is true, because they don't use much from BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5-Chef David Elstein, who also said before the Committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to verify their mission to "form, form and chat."
He said that only a few of the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and it should take an example of this change in "inform, clarify and maintain".
As regards partnerships, Elstein said that BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, which he said that only one handful is shown on TV, and enter Alianzen with the commercial senders to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the Nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are radiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have used worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaking of sound waves.
The tiny nematods change the direction in the moment when they are radiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by activating Motoneuron cells that are genetically changed to carry the membran channels responding to ultrasound waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, which can be used ultrasound to enable a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace deep heir stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of the Parkinson disease.
Fadenworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic airblases.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthening the ultrasound waves that then invade into the worms.
The increased ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4-ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are associated with, such a Nature Communications report.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematods, Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of their motoneurones wear TRP-4-ion channels.
When using ultrasoundly on the changed creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms where they enable the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a trambreaking tool, allowing scientists to turn on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages to this technology.
Unlike light, which needs to be distributed on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, low frequency irradiated woven fabrics can be passed unhindered and can be sent into the brain from above on the shelter.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily random for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin production cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right before your door!
The ads emphasize the British arms trade
View Amnesty International Anti-Wafen Messen-Video.
Frightening killer threats!
Foot Gelenk crushing legs!
Streubombs!
And electric shocks that cause frightening pain, but don't leave any trace!
The joyful voice and the cartoon images do not doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a warrant parody produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the willingness of the British government into the Rampenlight to bolster weapons on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are to be seen at bus stops and in the U-Bahn tensions and which require a second glance.
"Weighte announcement: Trip with DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) can be read in the type of London Underground and the brand marks of DLR line that are walking to the picture of a tank.
In September a swarm of arms dealers will drive with DLR ... Customers will be asked to help stop the weapon fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have issued their work in the Museum for Gray Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective with the name Special Patrol Group helped to distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £-package of inbuskeys, which claims that "according to about one third of the bus stop floors can be found on the planet."

The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and created by the advertising agency VCCP, who works in common with the graphical and Voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP-creative director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence that was around the advertising for the arms fair - through an exceL calendar leaflet - and thought: "We give them the campaigns that were trying to avoid them."
They played with the invention of a more realistic twelve business advertising, but "by embracing with bright colours and animation it remains stronger."
"They have made a fantastic job by helping us to make aware of selling illegal torture devices on the fair," says Tom Davies von Amnesty.
What we need now is a recording of the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment are not illegally handled before our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapon fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors spoil fantastic euphemistic products.

Eight golden rules for life in students' homes
11 years ago, as a self-catering 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still in faith in berets and moral relativeism, but I remember only now the stressed smiles of those I have angry – and the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of my learning can be destillated in eight simple rules.
The entry into students' homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to swallow: people tell where you come, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in regard to Corbyn and why you "do not love nor hate Marmite because in serious, boys, it's just a heape extract HAHA, I am in my room."
Get through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you to find out the people you might, in contrast to those you wouldn't speak, even if your amps are burning and those fire lubricators were.
Let people.
The rooms of people are often transformed into drinking receptions, film after events and municipal hitpoints, but they are also the places in which people are attracting and repressing their underwearse.
Relevant to this: Do not think of starting at the union with a relationship
Introverted receive a gross treatment at the University.
Your room should be a refugee, but many students' homes form a room-to-room building culture that can be friendly and socially and lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be the hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you must go away so that I can get the energy that I have used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a comlicion is exhausted - and send a SMS instead of knocking it.
Knock apropos: Do it.
A guy in my students' homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by backs.
Since you start the Union at the high point of the back-many, the cup on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of Brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Willkommen in the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offer home-made liverries is a good way to close friendships.
Her residents feel obliged to talk and will at the end perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course this depends on whether you are an adherent baker.
Bad mingled pumps from flour, sugar and fat lead to people to sleeping when you knock.
Food to steal is a common crime in students' homes.
Of course, is the clause of chicken a thief steel, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea?
Check this with the milk owner.
The opportunities are good that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it is angry and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced with it than my resident who added their milk a dish to punish thee.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make no noise that keeps people from sleep or from work.
It is not just about being an adherent man, but that you are in the truest sense of the word among the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my flur asked her neighbor if it's a bit about to put Drum & Bass a little less, because it's three o'clock, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with harder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., she was friendly to let her neighbors sleep two hours before she plundered her own music, closed her door and gave her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it romantic be if your future spouse would join randomly into the same student home?
Would it not be decisively embarrassing if you think that a roommate for your future spouse, reap on them, separate them again and then have to see them every day and perhaps contemplates how all of them take over to herself?
Of course, the heart goes his own paths - but if a warm fellow resident is definitely not your future spouse, you at least try to talk a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone left his key in his unclosed room, the border between an Ulk and Mobbing is more fine than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes the Bumerang.
By hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never delay someone's room with toothpasta and shampoo.
Lock her door and put her keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't worry their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Sequence houses for refugees, Singles, Low Servants
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the medium-sized French corner number of rows for people who do not have much money.
So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need dwelling room, but also the nursing mother and the low minister."
"I show how to build cheap and well today," says 44 year old in interview
Thousands of refugees will motivate on the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how to create a fast cheap living room: He builds in a project of series houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will encourage the home market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or tour halls has no sustainability.
For people remain in a large part here.
In view of the refugee flow, we also need enough living space in the next decades.
A whole banal, three-study rowing house is the solution.
Gildner: A series house needs at least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you spend people in dwelling blocks.
Each of the six houses that are built in the pilot project consists of three units for each four asylum seekers.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's again peace, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily transformed according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters living per house is 184 000 euros without a plot.
That's overlookable.
Six months the construction lasted.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I went through my project correctly.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening damoklesis valued special construction and the deposit regulation.
Very brilliant.
It is still deposited, who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three places.
Only in the cities is there the place for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents react to their series house project?
Gildner: There were those who forgotten me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What's definitively wrong.
But do you not intensify the competition struggle for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True, we had a tree of construction in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built, which can hardly make a more affordable.
My project has the message, also the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees but also the only mother or the low minister.
I show how to build cheap and well today.
That's why.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first worked with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by entering the settings app, type "General" and then select "Software update".
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have been affected by installing problems as they receive an error message that tells the 'software update failed'.
To avoid the problem, users are recommended to wait either until the storm goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean the removal of apps to create space - but Apple has made this unlikely more likely by the deterioration of the updates. It will also be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall it as soon as the process is finished.
It is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may switch to halfways, and this could lead to a cancellation of the update.

Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The Chess Club, founded three months ago, "Schachfriende Bad Kissingen" has taken another member into its series, thus the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who held up more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the Kur.
Gauselmann is carrier of the Federal Service Cross 1. Class and honorary citizens of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The Schachclub in Bad Kissingen supported Gauselmann with a donation taken up the president Alfred Klein.
In this way, it is possible to record chess players who cannot bring up the contribution of the Member State.
Youth work and talent search should also be advanced.
Gauselmann wants the membership of the Schachclub and also of friendship with the Tennisclub "Rot-Weiß" to be seen as a expression of his association with the Kurstadt.
Quarters office searches direct contact
Saludis and the Old Center Antonistift have joined up under the mantel of social foundation and opened a new approach at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the centre of the city.
In fact, it was said at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarter office has recently been opened.
Here, directly next to the shopping market, will receive Senioren and Advisory Information on questions such as care insurance or services of health and care.
For years, we have observed our ambulant care service that often careers are left alone.
In the end, there are many questions.
"The new home ruler Jutta Weigand, who, as business manager of Old aid, is responsible for the Antonistift and the citizen hospital as well as for the ambulant service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new Quarter Office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the Senior Centre and Saludis are ideally complemented.
Saludis stands for prevention, care and reha.
"The Senioren Center for Care and Care", painted Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for opening the new Quarter Office in the city of the city, both managers see in particular the demographic change.
For this makes a good decentral infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future essential.
In addition, the Quarter's office also devoted to the association in the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and they are loading to a regular coincidence."
This helps the social foundation to contribute to the best possible self-established and well-known environment of Senioren.
The Quarter Office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 p.m. to 12 p.m.
Insights Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the time for the Fuchspark Stadium for the FC Eintracht Bamberg game had not yet been established as a date for the third igists of Würzburger Kickers, the 6th October was established.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the Achtelfinale of the Bavarian Soccer Totopokals against third-countryists FC Würzburger Kicker has now been finalized.
The play is played on Tuesday, 6 October, at the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadion.
"We are glad that now we know when the game goes on the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the currently-started card pre-verkauf.
It is special for our team to play against a third-party player.
We therefore hope for many viewers, and this is not without reason, because flulict games have a special ride.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg in 2010 moved through victory to the district religion 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional religion 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 Euro and is qualified for the first round of the DFB Vereinspocal 2016/2017.

Wiener Architekt Karl Mang 92-year-old died
Karl Mang, one of the Vienna Architecture Doyen, is dead.
He died on 5 September, at the age of 92, as the artist house said on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house lost an honorary member and, at the same time, "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it said in the broadcast.
In 1922, Mang studied architecture at Friedrich Lehmann at the Technical University in Vienna, and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a free-maker architect, but was also a teacher, writer and institute manager.
He was President of the Austrian Institute for Formulation from 1972 to 1983.
In the 80s he was commissioned to the Austrian Theatre Museum in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkovitz.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese commences police with money
The ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been unimportant in Bremen.
Soccer was once, now Tim Wiese, Ex-National Championshipkeeper in Germany and Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have made his own statement in the past two years.
On the other hand, intellectually he has not to do so.
Howse had been cut in the Bremer downtown just when he saw how a parking-wagler exhibited a penalty for his white chevrolet Camaro.
Howse then stimulated out of the business, insulted the officer and threw her the lucky money penalty in front of the feet, as reported the "picture" newspaper.
In the city of Bremen you confirm the prerequisites, the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The thing is still in the test," says it from the city of Bremen.
Only after that, it is decided whether or not to show or not.

The fruitful soil and the rain forest-typical climate of Isla del Rey are best suitable for marihuana plants.
For three days, Panama's authorities have cut out the 4500 plants and burned them.
Men prefer to 17-year-old Afghane
Witnesses are looking for an incident in Bad Soden Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 p.m., three young men were on foot from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One from the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters after the police, and called them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the height of the bft tank station.
On the territories of the tank station, there were also three persons.
One of these men now cried to the youths and struck this with the fire.
The victim suffered a nose infringement and blooded strongly from the nose.
When his two friends stayed up and talked embarrassingly to the slanders, it first left from his sacrifice.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends now.
The daddy followed the group with a car to their apartment and went over more than a few times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the infringement went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the slander and another male person.
As a result of a troop, the face and the upper snippets of the victim were exhibited.
The infectant had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
So far there is only a vague daddy description.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters.
The second slander was supposed to have been about 1.65 meters and was clothed with a Jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police asks Witnesses and notifiers to report at the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeenbürgermeister Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country, physicians - Asendorf, on the other hand, are lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel rockstehausen goes in rest, her husband Karl-Heinrich stands his successor in the next months with a half place on the side.
After a reconstruction phase, Müller reopens practice on 12 October, until then he invests EUR 310000 in the spaces at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first time when the rocky houses of Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently trying to get into practice their specialist training at the Verdeener Hospital and who also wants to get into practice for the next year.
"We always had in the back that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laugh.
"When it was so far, I just called them."
The couple Müller enjoyed the idea of doing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
As a advantage he also sees to be his own boss soon.
And so one became one thing, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The two-fold family father Frank Müller has also grown up, his medical study in Hannover followed stations in several doctoral practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Redenburg.
At present, he is a chief doctor in Sulingen, and he was ordered as a governing emergency in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and is engaged in the Broek building of Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice is prepared for the new boss.
During the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen worked as a home doctor, his Gattin Ursel (internistin) specialized on the gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to leave themselves as a household doctor.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a speaking room more.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total grant of 50000 euros will be granted to Müllers in the context of a support programme from the district of (25000 euros) as well as the Collective Community (12500 euros) and the community (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and rejoic we are that the practice is carried forward," emphasized Samt Congregator Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, some 2000 patients come into the practice of Felstehausen, in the northern German average practice it is about 500.
There is another home doctor practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of practice by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone.
Those who visit Müllers speaking hours continue to look mainly in familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their departure in Asendorf a era, the medicines have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel remembers murmuring rocky houses.
A little weedness has been feeling her after long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients still often," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000 square metre base."
"Bisher I have always pressed me from garden work now could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We are going through the refugees"
"Well, border controls are also high at our southern border," said Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel.
Still, it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request could also make this "of course".
Human care and safety are in the foreground.
It is clear that "that it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we don't accept borderless migration flows, even though not over the Austrian-Slowen border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers Corridor - Slovenia denied
The Croatian Government had notified before that Slovenia also wishes to leave refugees to Austria and Germany and, under all circumstances, also establish corridore for the refugees.
However, this minister of Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach did not see.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely inacceptable", instead, Slovenia will intensify monitoring of the border - especially for Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
The Minister stressed that Slovenia would not want its limits on refugees.
"Every EU member must fill out its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," highlighted Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government said, the first refugees had already tried to go to Tuesday in East Croations at the Tovarnik/Sid border transition to turn out the registration.
The Croatian police could attack her in the nearest maize fields.
According to local media, in the Croatian Tovarnik, police vehicles with new refugees are constantly involved.
It is mainly about Syria and Afghane, including many women and children.
Save services and the red cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country was recorded with about 4000 refugees, said inside Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be transmitted towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
However, the Belgian government stated that it was to point out to people to introduce certain routes: "We cannot, nor we want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city in the early days would expect further buses.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The insassen were all night away from the Macedonian border by Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has made, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually come to the move predicted by observers of the former Balkan-route of Turkey-Griechenland-Mazedonia-Serbien-Ungarn to a somewhat western route.
Croatia: surrounding opportunities for border control
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong flow of refugees.
Details he did not call, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-senge member has "imposing opportunities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia belongs to this since 2007, the EU partners since then present a good witness to the country as regards the standards of border controls.
On Serbian side there are still some 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border zone.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the Horgos border, which leads to Romzke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border transitions of Horgos and Backi Breg remain fully blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Minister of Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesdays with a local octograph in Horgos: He believed the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be very high refugee figures at present.
You couldn't say if they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helper advises migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are recorded through Croatia.
However, the cross-border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not at risk: in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian War still not authorised mine fields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatic police announced that a team of mine spacers was sent in the border region.
Börsen-Hacker: Ukraine pays $30 million
Supranonok is supposed to have heard a ring of Cyber criminals, which has been suspected to have always looked at yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
Insider businesses on the financial markets are intended to be made with the utilised information.
According to this, the mediators were totally wreaked over $100 million.
"The present comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are finally caught," says SEC communication.
The processes against 32 other accusers took place in the case.
Most of the accused ones are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted from both in the US and in Eastern Europe.
Ökumenian Hospizhilfe Mannheim has been present for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a rule of operation.
People do their concerns, partly fast steps, partially cozy.
They operate the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon at the parade course.
Hold tracks.
Pulsating, pulsing life in beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large tablets each with the title "Before I want to die"....
The ecumenic hospiz aid made attention with this action on her 20-year-old existence and looks closely faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josephine Lammer.
The leader of the Ökumenian Hospiz aid is also available to the passengers for questions and discussions like the honourable staff.
While a passant spontaneously grabs the creativity and the phrase "joy my life," "read," "when the camper runs through the USA", "stop the war" or "not long suffering", others remain standing short, read, say sentences like "I am not yet" and then continue.
At the edge, small discussions on action on itself, on life, on the way of dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I make it clear that when the end comes to this world, I can live responsiblely," says the director of the Diaconian Work Mannheim, who is together with the Caritas Association Trainer of the Ökumenian Hospiz aid.
Therefore, this publicity-effective action would be good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone on the tables wants to be publicly informed, but is understandable, eventually it is a very personal thing.
The topic of death and death has still been arrested with Tabus, says the experience of Josephine Lammer, although the hospit movement has contributed much to the opening of people over the past years.
An estimate that Angelika shares Godefroid.
The death and grief member belongs to the honourable staff of the first hour.
By personal experience faced with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to engage in death aid.
When the Economic Hospiz aid was seeking honorary officials by call, she immediately reported and had been in the formation of 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 venues - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the affected and family members in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
All of them are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can work well with its task and with the experiences and experiences made.
"I see the life of another wait, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant ecumenic hospital service is free of charge and uncertainty.
The financial support of the hospitals and donations of family and associations allows training as well as training and supervisions of death and grief members.
Every two years training is offered for new co-workers.
The plates described on Saturday are now issued in the house of the evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be noted on cards.
FedEx results mixed financial views for 2016 reduced
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery guarantee reduced its profit view of a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that she plans to attend about 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time in last year, FedEx announced that the company wanted to set 500,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year, which ends in May next, 20 cent less than the previous forecast.
Analystens expected a survey of FactSet 10,84 $.
The lower prospect is despite the price increases, which are average 4,9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and, despite higher ground transport allowances, of heavy and large packages collected from November.
The company said that it still expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trade.
Chair and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings "solidated earnings when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday employment plans were announced one day later than the UPS Rivalen, which was planned to set 90,000 to 95.000 additional workers, such as the same number as the last year.
In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx earned 692 million dollars, 6 percent more than the previous year.
The result per share was 2.42 $ per share, just behind the 2.44 $ per share, which predicted twelve of Zacks Investment Research.
The sales rate increased by 5 per cent to 12,3 billion dollars.
Six of bags interviewed analytics expected $12,23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been a decline in international priority shipping which brought the turnover into its Express shipping.
But the tree in the online shop has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter the sales rate increased by 29 per cent, but the operational result was basically smooth because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance.
The Express Unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while the result was reduced because of higher labour costs in the truck business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before opening, the FedEx acts sank by 3.85 $, or 2.5 percent, to 150.15 $.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record height on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategen spends two days this week around a 27-foot of Honduras-Mahagoni-Tish to decide whether it is time to raise the guide rate for the first time since almost a decade.
It is threatening about them at the end of the two-stage meeting hall, which is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests in front of all other things.
The Central Bank has a two-fold contract from the Congress: the maximising of US employment and prices here stablely.
But since the big recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predicting it. It is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is started to be devoted from the exemplary stimulus by the nearly zero interest rate of short term since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data in the economy shows that it grows solidly, the latest towers in global financial markets could make the already careful Fed representatives anxious to strengthen this volatility by increasing the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only a quarter point.
"On the other hand, the labour market and the inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, head-economy at the Makler company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a prerequisite not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which is uncertain about the financial market itself.
Some half of the economists who have recently been consulted by Bloomberg have foretold an interest increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect a waiting of the Fed, with a key indicator that shows only a 30% chance of increase.
This indicates a decline in the share market if the Fed increases the sentence unless the stratter mixes the stroke by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average was 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was caused by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the sentence this week, said John Lonski, head-ökonom at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would have the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "they must go very far in her declaration to calm down the financial markets so that she would not be panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would rest the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
One month ago, the Fed seemed in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points in this month, the first small step in slow deterioration of monetary conditions that would test the strength of restoration in the USA.
In the spring and early summer, Yellen said that in spite of the complaints of liberals that more economic progress was needed, she expected to increase the sentence this year.
Although the creation of jobs in August slowed, improvement on the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the Fed looks for full employment.
Improvements have shown signs of reception.
And although the inflation constantly passed under the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and need them because of the effort on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, head-econom at Pantheon Macro Economics.
But the financial markets around the world have been cut together last months after China had disassembled its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Value fell by more than 16% under its highest level in May, as investors feared that a slowing of the Chinese economy would be threatening global growth.
The market has recovered something this month, with the dow is now at nearly 10% below May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulences affect the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy were not occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the trains at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former UCLA staff.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get the effects better in the handle.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there are almost no reliable data that describes developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed Currency Authority of the World has become.
The influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years.
The mere note of the then head of Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "verengen" their monetary expansion, deprived confusions around the globe.
In one world, in which markets and economies are growing together, the Fed representatives may expect them to monitor not only the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the property management of the company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., observed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that seem to be not associated with economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is used for an increase in interest, quoted decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its leadership by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "thrownly limited recognized impact on growth in the USA", said Lacker.
One year later, the Fed representatives made these reductions clear.
The Fed should firstly put aspects of financial stability during a serious crisis such as market collapse in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Committee on Interesting Bank of England.
The latest turbulences don't come near this level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where she fears an interest increase because the markets are exciting," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should predict the time.

Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany in these days.
A warm welcome is not going without the commitment of countless honoral helper.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unusual asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is with body and soul teacher.
She still likes to know with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she is doing it in the Asylum applicant's home at the Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different education than at a proper school.
Brazil’s paediatric society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breasts
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tries to clarify women in a shocking way about how important good nutrition is during silence. It is doing this with the presentation of babies that are succumbing on breasts that are painted with the presentations of unforeseen foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbon hydrostats that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy demands, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calories import is not the only diättic adjustment that mothers should do.
A current study under the leadership of Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The Council of Bernried approved the construction request for the EUR 2.3 million expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattered for solar plants.
The plannings for the long-running tour building at Bernrieder Sports Mountains come forward step forward: In the recent meeting of the Council of the Community, the processed construction application without big discussions was insulted.
Before that, the body, among other things, had adopted an application for a construction legal "exception" respective "resolution" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was the authorization for a special form relating to roof construction.
A "Satteldach with non-midious first and roof overstand" is therefore to be built.
The background of the planning is the intended use of the roof floor for solar plants: "We get a wonderfully large south roof together," said Bürgermeister Joseph Steigenberger at the meeting.
In the 'resolution' it was again about the roof that should be under 10 degrees for energetic reasons, different from the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "resolution" was therefore necessary because the construction plan on the roof was not allowed "exceptions" with the Bernried municipality Council usually accompanied in liberation applications rather restrictively.
But it is not a returning project for the tower halls: "We do not create a precision fall", says Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a Community project in the municipality and SV Bernried.
About 2,3 million euros are calculated in costs.
Subsidies are expected by school and breeding sports.
The next process is now presented to the Board Office for the 18 x 36 meters of large hall for the test.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Algau
The Peißenberg Hospital is supposed to be closed earlier than planned - 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become new medical director at the Algau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plans of hospital GmbH of the Landkreis that confirmed the Landrät Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, a decision taken by the Supervisory Council and the next Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were implemented, all of the approximately 50 employees at the hospital would continue to benefit from Peißenberg.
The predominant majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the other internal station.
The rooms are present.
The employees who cannot be able to work with Algau is supposed to be offered a job in Weilheim, Jochner-Weiß.
The employees were informed about the plans.
It has dissolved the change of the announcement of Dr. Andreas Eder, who is only since the beginning of the medical director of the Schongau clinic and now turns to a private practice near the hospital.
In the question of who is going to be following, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fish" came to the game that was ready to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Algau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this meant a "evaluation" and a dissemination of the offer in the field of "innere medicine", says Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is specialist for heart progressmakers and defibrilators.
Algau (180 beds) is specialised at the internal station on gastroenterological diseases.
Transitional methods for the next two years, fishermen with their team, when the Supervisory Board agrees to the two houses, until the previous hospital of the clothing, which still has 35 beds, should be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018 when the currently-running rehabilitation is completed at Weilheim Hospital.
Landrät Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, encountered rumors that the house, which is located in the property of the Federal Bank, should be used as accommodation for asylum wovens.
"I concluded that." As it goes on with the property, Jochner-wit could not say there are several considerations.
There are currently a short-term care of caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better we couldn't happen to such an opportunity will not come back," said fishermen about the quasi move to the lecture, which were "positive and very comprehensive" taken by the employees.
A real perspective for the house, in which fishermen have been working as a bossian for over 30 years, has not been there.
He had been asked by Algau's colleagues to take over the posts of the medical director.
In the past decades the Peißenberg Hospital (one 100 beds) has been threatened by closeness, departments were closed, such as surgery and birth aid.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar Löwen are demanded today (20.15 p.m.) at the mountain HC.
The Bundesliga table leader is in Wuppertal, although the clear favorite, however, no one exists.
In the past season, the BHCs took a painful precipitation and have something good to do there.

Refugees need accommodation: Study warns from housing
The situation on the German housing market is stressed.
Even more and more refugees are looking for a payable stay.
The pressure on the apartment market grows.
Social housing is a challenge.
The distribution fights on the German housing market have recently begun.
With the coming refugees and seekers from the EU, more and more people are insisting on a market that has already been overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with income-swake citizens around the last affordable apartments.
To cover the demand for payable apartments, 40,000 new units should be built by 2020.
To this result, a study comes on behalf of the association "Social housing".
To compare: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
This means that there are 140,000 apartments.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live after the first three months of their stay than asylum seekers in an initial reception accommodation.
Many are then struggling on the apartment market and entering into the long snakes before the rental apartments.
According to Statistical Federal Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only the increasing refugee payments.
The study also makes significant failures in the housing policy in recent years.
Germany shoots a lack of apartments in front of itself, which grows from year to year.
Currently missing in the balling areas already around 770,000 living units, Matthias Günther, writer of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in major cities in WG rooms.
Young adults stayed freely longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flat on the apartment market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per head has first fallen back over the past years.
In order to solve the problem, the bond "Social housing" proposes a restart.
New incentives are intended to reconcile social housing.
This could be discarded on the basic application tax and the basic tax on promoted apartments could be suspended.
In addition, according to the bond, attractive tax depreciation options should be required.
The support programme for refugee accommodations by the State Bank KfW is now well available to cities and communities.
A good week after the start was already available on Monday evening with 184 million euros over the half of the euros available.
Now the project could even be raised.
Refugees have free experience: Croatia and Slovenia correct corridor
After Hungary there is virtually no more passage, because more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the passing through Slovenia to the north without barriers.
However, dangerous is the route.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian minister of Interior, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Minister of Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the destruction of the Serbian-ungarian border, hundreds of refugees have been broken to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television broadcaster RTL.
Hungary had revoked his border for refugees on the previous day.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, are virtually overflowing asylum procedures in Hungary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
The Croatian President Zoran Milanovic explained: "You can pass through, and we prepare for this possibility."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police had attacked the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU-Nabourland Croatia.
Most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to Sid with the bus as well as with taxes.
After their arrival, they would have tried to get over the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not go to border acids.
Other dangers for the borders are threatened: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 1990s.
Minor spacers should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the conclusion of the border, there are little more refugees after Hungary.
On Tuesday the police counted 366 people.
Shortly before gateway on Monday, there was still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws imply the overwhelming and damaging of the borders as a crime.
In the southern border city of Szeged, therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
The condemned threatens liability penalties up to five years and the destruction from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications, almost all - 93 - the most important transition of Röszke on Tuesday at the border.
Among the applicants, 13 families with small children and two older people were.
On Wednesday morning, there were 40 refugees left there.
Practically, however, no one has the prospect of granting Asyl in Hungary.
According to ungaric view, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The refused asylum seekers should be suspended there.
Only a few hundred refugees were gathered before the Transit zone in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They gathered the waste that had left tens of thousands of people in the last weeks on the roadside.
Slots were built down and one of the recording camps in the border was transformed.
For the purpose of this transformation, no one wanted to express himself.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the conclusion of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
Around 20.000 migrants, however, were still in the country after government details.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Training from there to Germany was stopped on the order of German authorities on the morning.
In release, smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot.
Citizen Championshipperson left the border
"We were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday when ten people suddenly had travel victims at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted the train to passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail transport with Austria on Sunday, it was in Wernstein closing," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the trucks together with two other helmets and their cars over the border to the Middle Passau.
Before we have sold the unforgettable guests with jause and beverages.
We've just said we're bringing them to Passau with the car.
"This was of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN talk.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take it to give a generous donation - 100 euros for firefire.
"That has been very delighted," says Stadler.
On Sunday evening, the train passengers were moved to passau by a ICE to a regional move, and after the short-term announcement that rail transport was set to Germany, but they were still trying to cross the border.
However, the regional move was posted before the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival associated with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, a two-bridge run sporting day before - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán sends more cigarettes to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping the creation of structures in order to ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has moved high official and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government in the dunst circle of national socialism.
Unfortunately, this policy is not just those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to be found that the "globed land" that she invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge to produce in terms of the continuing refugee flows and the near winter, in terms of human beings for protective seekers.
And it will be even greater to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Conrad in search for 35.000 winter festivals
Conrad has all hands to do with the refugee classification.
Christian Konrad is habitated that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen bank to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center of Traiskirchen has already got Konrad in the handle.
"We have no obdachless more in Traiskirchen," he reported his first success.
Conrad also said that the 200,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday were without a great whirl, praised the organizational "measuring".
On the other hand, the Ministry of Interior spoke of a "crisis" situation.
Overall, Konrad calculates a need of 85.000 quarters in the year.
In order to meet the number, 35.000 accommodations must be found in the next weeks - 20.000 are intended to provide the countries, 15.000 of the covenant.
If it becomes more refugees, we can create it.
"But it's not a fasque without soil," Konrad said.
He has already spoken with the heads of the country.
They would have sured him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it runs well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad.
In the morning there will be a meeting with Kardinal Christoph Schönborn, explaining how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF action "help like we".
Private persons can offer uncomplicated accommodation on the platform.
In addition, you hope on hotels that are empty in winter.
Conrad and Maier criticized the standards for the accommodation yesterday as "high up".
In emergency times it may not be that Quarterers must maintain a certain height of the craft holders or size of the upper lights.
For a period of time, "Not standards" should apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of Interior, he was more successful in the provision, conrad founded with his experience.
I'm an older man, who doesn't say the iniquity in the face without any further.
Convincing force is its most important weapon.
Conrad and Maier do not cause any costs as they explained themselves.
Their number of employees wants to increase to three to four.
The own quarter search was not yet successful.
Konrad wanted to create a container at Stephansplatz as a office.
But it seems that there are problems with the approval.
Linz demands a better division
First, no opening of sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center plans the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at present, since the people concerned can currently be put without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further locations should be examined for the emergency.
Critics are the head of the city in the division of refugees within the state of Germany.
Other districts also have to contribute here.
Seehofer: "Grenzen are not fired"
In a longer call with the Bavarian Minister President Horst Seehofer (CSU), the National Head of State Joseph Pühringer (VP) has arranged the further action in the refugee question on Monday.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders are not canceled.
The continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are just the relevant border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will not be anymore.
However, the protective seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Producer once more solidarity in the refugee question was required by other EU Member States.
The fact that Austria is also reinforcing controls at its borders is "a logical result" for Pruisinger from the acting of the Germans.
The next runtastic is a question of time
The generalisation of the "new throw" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the stock-covered IT Group S&T, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rent to young innovative companies from the technology area.
"In IT the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us," says S&T-Chef Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine to invest in startup fans of the New Werft and later to invest what is needed.
Since the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - where Niederhauser promises some of them: "The next runtastic is just a question of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the technician, belonging to each third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic (FFG).
The building is charged by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters residual area in the building are already rent, for more 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni-Inhaber opened second business in the Arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to put a dog.
This project had to put up the 49-year-old holder of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade shortly: finally she has now received growth in the form of another business place.
In the Furla shop compared to the business where they, among other things, sell bags, bags, shoes and coats of different manufacturers, all of them is now in line with laundry handbags of Furla, money stocks are available from 75 euros.
Greater bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Last night, the new shop is in operation.
Several weeks ago were rebuilded.
"I have long thought if I should open another shop," Breit says.
The decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also associated by the idea of a own location in which only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Great Linz, who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who owned Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been placed broadly from her mother in the wheat.
Most of me, when something develops, I can show new trends to leakable prices.
Why so some woman in view of a beautiful handbag in petition can also not answer the professional woman with last security.
Maybe it is that a beautiful bag is worthy of every outfit.
The Callstadt Brulljesmaker
Donald Trump's predecessors came from a place whose residents are called investors.
This property is also linked to the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exciters.
Whether he speaks strangerly, journalists are stimulating or explicit of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US President-in-Office Office is strongly stimulating the election campaign.
And cut well on it.
This is also registered in the Pfälzian Callstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate milliardary origin.
The New Yorker with the fehnfrisur is a term for many in the Winzerdorf on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200 resident location are related to him over-though corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in election campaign.
Simone Wendel was a film on Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal to become mighty man in the world?
"I think they find this somewhat exciting, but in their calm city's way are not so impressed," says Simone Wendel.
The borough cityr has rotated an amusing documentary film over the place and its famous splendids, which besides Trump, the Heinz Ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modestness, comes in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) as well as saying that he would certainly be successful if he would live in Kallstadt.
He has not brought it there to the king of the heart.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, it also tends to say that Trump "was a little grandmaul", says Wendel.
Randomly, the nickname, which has the cold city around, "The brilljesmakers" - to High German: the investors, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the investors.
The Trump's success history began in 1885 when the later Grandfather emigrated and opened a local for golden graves in the United States.
The basic stone of the real estate group was the first property purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of Tragic: her desire to return to home for a long time failed by the Bavarian state to which the palace was at that time.
He did not take Trump because he once had been unauthorised, the director of the Institute of Pfältic History and People's Science, Roland Paul, had explained to be movie-start.
Trump was the grandson of a "illegal excavator".
This is in contrast with the sometimes marked statements of follow-up.
It had repeatedly spoken of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to shoot illegal immigrants.
"As the polter is not so sympathic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote relative Trumps ("The Oma was a born Trump, the Opa was born Heinz").
The Winzer in rest sees the American rather distanced, "he is always so exciting".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says 72-year-old.
"He never cared about the city."
The retirement of Veronika Schramm mentioned as some of the Kallstadters that a family's offspring gave Heinz a visit to the church organ, which was generally well coming.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," the 68-year-old says.
They find it better if he don't want the choice, because "they has such radical views, I don't know whether it is good".
If those who had the Sagen at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been, "he would never have arrived there at all".
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My President isn't it," she says.
And, "The grapes will also be mature without the President Trump".
Wendels Film, for which Trump was interviewed long, has seen 12 000 cinemas, including in the United States.

At least a fifth of its area must be identified as a protection area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluation despite the attempts of Nine to take the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson eilen to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has not brought any major shifts in the reviews for today.

This disadvantage of distance did not seem to play any role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 viewers in the five main cities, compared to today 339,000.
Today a light increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained back behind the last Thursday (343,000).

So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 viewers at Today.
This is the most interesting thing happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these mornings more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the review!

The last three votes: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may be unconscious who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, who finally landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was in the greatest secret keeping.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not commend whether she is the one who received the last Rose.
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons teams on the day before three two are going, you may have given an overlooking note of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips to the final on Thursday
All three women have been lying about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense for Humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Wood's last Rose?", her answers could be become to the spectator who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment when I went to the house and (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought this throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it makes so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they've got the right chemical.
They feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood were suitable as a couple.
From her view, Mackay said that the visit to the house made her clear that Wood could be "the One".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this isn't just a game - I'm now unlimited on him," she said.
And when she was asked who to choose wood if not she was, she was advisable.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls as well - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is exhibited on Ten on Wednesday, 19:30.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and trainers Jim Tomsula and looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers had banished Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a arrangement as it did the Aussie Rugby-Liga conversion at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also to the current game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the sticky cabin after the game.
Instead of mealing his rookies before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49r sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who encouraged him to forget his poisoned fishing and to care for the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patts with a point restored in the first square of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and its massive Australian succession had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the playground after the fumble fluid and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't introduce a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just care about the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the snitzer with his origin Debut at that time in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to an attempt for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his instagram.

The free electors demand the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of high refugees.
At the beginning of the FW-Hubstclause in Großwallstadt, Hubert Aiwanger warned a serious crisis in Bayern's schools, if there is no new teacher for many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to maintain schools from the collapse," said Aiwanger.

The Country Day Fraction of the Free Wishlists will be in the underfrequency community until Friday.
In fact, there were very different main topics.
But the record number of refugees is now dominating the Free Wähler-Treffen.
"Of course, the theme of Asyl will be overlapping the clause," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger demanded the establishment of UNO protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it was during the war of Yugoslavia in the nineties.
"So it's not going on, we have to deal with the causes," said the Free Wähler Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to move the free choosers as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW-Chef criticized that several federal countries were not consistent: "We needed unanimously uniform standards of the federal countries."
"Bayers shift off, others don't."
"Then we need to become more negotiating."
However, national policy should not fall under the table in Großwallstadt.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: educational policy.
For the new year of school, Kulcus Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 Gymnasia started the pilot experiment "Medium grade plus", with an extension of the gymnasial medium level of three to four years – then it takes over nine years until the abitur.
But that's not far enough for Aiwanger.
"The G9 theme must be accelerated," said the FW-Chef.
We call for freedom of choice for all the Gymnasia that wants.
Free driving at G9 everywhere where it is desired.

4 people killed after police shooting rubber on demonstration in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber into a crowd of shoes, which demonstrated the proposed new constitution, said a official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Heading District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demons had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before she retreated rubber.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber dishes, which is known that they can kill, which is traditionally used as less fatal alternative, seemed to produce so high death rates.
The conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces, which are formed under the proposed new constitution, would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Taharus, who want to have a own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflicts since 10.
In August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to distribute the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial theme in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Since 2008, the work on a new constitution has been on the way, but the lawnmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the Constitution Design in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.

Project Hove: Details are available on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Small Sea at Emden accept the shape.
The investor first presented public plans for the project.
Some investors are still worried - they fear the sale of their reception
For months, behind closed doors have been negotiated, wreaked, discussed and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested company "System-Bau" in the Emder Council City Development Committee on Monday evening presented its plans for the first time.
Originally, this point had been on the non-published part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP Group, which were present to the investors and the management of secret crops, Ralf Behrends went to the open: "We have not yet a answer to all questions," he said before the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to meet all the smells now.
The 10 to 12 million euros have been in the discussion for months.
Heated reactions among seaboth owners who had come to the meeting produced the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, sea boss owner and board member at the representative of the investors, Pro Hove, complaint: "This is a giant gap that overthrews all the other buildings".
In addition, he fears as many other project critics that transport would increase strongly through the planned size of the plant: "There must come to all bus charges so that it can be calculated," says Schulz
What happens exactly on the well a hectare of large area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we need to have been a sneaky concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still varyable.
Zwillings-Nachwuchs at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to enjoy young adults in his Gorillas.
The 26-year-old dian has brought twins to the world yesterday.
Zwilling births are rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German Zoo is almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, says it by the Zoo.
The sex of the newborn Gorilla-swillinge is not yet firm because Mother Dian holds it close to the body.
First, the "picture" reported.
NHC says 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center, on Tuesday, said a wide print system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde, which has a 60-procent chance to develop into a tropical whirltor in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, for example, in the middle of the Cape Verde and the Small Antilles, also has a 60-procent potential to form a tropical whirlwind in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts duplicate-spind campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a double-speed campaign that should bring 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations that should help thousands of refugees overrun the European nations, as they flee from the war and armed countries.
Google has an extraordinary personal approach to the notice of the donation call on his blog.
Instead of making a manager an announcement, Rita Masoud wrote about her personal experience, a Google employees who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old.
"By our trip many dark railway and bus travels, like hunger, thirst, cold and anxiety," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Reduction Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to 11 million dollars up to a value of 5.5 million to google.com/refuggeerelief.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has distributed more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from the war destroyed Afghanistan, Jemen, Iraq and Libya.

For easy overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say that slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data needs a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to take up food.
Over the years, Adipositas operations have been effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are sickly fatly with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in respect of size, is considered normally between 18,5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI are considered to be fat.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of Adipositas-Chirurgy - Magenbypass and Magen-Schlauchbildung - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight.
The average BMI under those under which this operation took place from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
However, the BMI remained in the case of those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments about 29 years of age.
Among those who undergone surgery, 36% had totally lost diabetes disease and 28% partly.
In the medical-treated group, in comparison to this, diabetic was completely eliminated only with one percent and in part only about two percent.
In addition, the results of the controls of blood pressure, Triglyceride and the "bad" LDL-holesterin "in general better in the 'surgery' group" found the authors.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hämoglobin A1c is best held under 7 percent, writes researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level decreased from around 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group it remained stable to approximately 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved Hämoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, said the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass Chirurgie Group had lost more weight compared to the gastrektomy group (18.7 per cent of 14,2 kg), increased declines in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% to 2.1%) and rather recorded complete overflow of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16,7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of the surgery after five years, there are indications from a study of harder people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years, compared with a group trying to perform conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show a advantage for survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said that it was restant for persons with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient is lying with his BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think as soon as they have gathered these genetic changes that have tied their bodies with fatty and diabetes, a conversion is really difficult."
Love story plays in Hunsrück

"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take up all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the actual solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the lasting refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten - day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which devoted Ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the given circumstances, humanity interests should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised the challenge of the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Search for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions how a real peace and real development can be created, mainly by education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must consider how to reduce death in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and revealed that the US’s violent reactions moved a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my contribution in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in violence.
"I know his motifs were good, but he took violence, and that has triggered unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in handling infection by children over the past 4 years
Gift control centres in the United States report about a nearly 400-procent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve, which close alcoholic hand defectants, says Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia Poison Center, the cases of intake of hand defectants in children under 12 years reporting gift control centres increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children get more and more frequently to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going into the emergency," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectantly, while some do it to impress their friends or to be encouraged in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectant only because of a cheap experience.
Youths have supposedly mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouth water to get a harder drink.
Young children can be attracted by attractive fertilizers of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand desinfection agents) are those parfumed.
There are disinfectants with petroleum, grape and orange dishes that are very appealing for children.
Hand-infectives contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in small children, few injections can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Giftnot call centre at the University of Kansas, Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So you wouldn't let no Schluck Whisky stand around, but people leave this hand desinfection agent in a range of children, and when children come to it, then it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes from after earthberry fragrance of hand-infectives in school, was taken into an emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally drinked by an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency restraint that she treated at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate kindergirl house on signs of Hirn-Trauma, as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had struck her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very distressing," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand-infectives outside the scope of the child.
In addition to alcohol poison, some disinfectants were associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died women after screwing hand defectives, having a toxic, uncleared ingredient.
Personnel of health authorities suggested that the product had methanol, a fatal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active substance.
In January three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their "gemeen" teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the school room," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic against hand defectants and banished them from her room.
The police considered the injured plan as a "swap" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.

The lack of title competition in the Scottish football boast Niederland - de Boer
The former ranner medium field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title reality with the ranters.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why?"
It's because the ranters aren't there.
People here don't just talk about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what they're interested.
There is a lot of tension in the Old-Firm games, and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, swears Deila.

We feel the exact thing - but we need to continue.
We really need the support of Celtic because this makes the players better.
It is so important to stand together now.
Warburton careful for January transfers
In spite of his comments, only a few weeks ago, which suggested that he demanded some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful about the signing of new accesses and persists that he does not want to stir the unity of the Ibrox-Kader.
The Ex-Chef by Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this season time to integrate what you saw with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is addressed by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic-Zielperson Michu with withdrawal indication

Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it grows totally in the United Kingdom.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in May until July with 164.000 while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Schottland Unemployment rate of 5.9% exceeded 5,5% of the UK, as shown by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12.000 during the three months, with the number of employees now 2.612.000.
The employment rate for Scotland was 74.0 percent over the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented the latest figures and said: "The long-term government plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."

Why I'll be witnessing an Exekution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will sit in a viewer gallery in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossi is exempted by the toxic syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
For the first time in January, the invitation was about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day went closer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty.
There would be a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see executions in the United States, and since often more applications are available as places, a macaber lottery will take place in order to decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Those who are selected will watch it emotionless.
I can't.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossip's close friend, with which I developed my own relationship over the months with telephones and a two and a half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh much when we talk.
The prison officers say that I can't be a witness and an journalist, so it will not be allowed to take a note book and a pencil to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to give up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you receive access.
I complained with her.
She admitted that she could "they could have better formed," but she still think it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossi had problems with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of Witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to write there.
When he dies, he thinks the public work of movement will help against death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I did.
I don't want to go back to all details again.
I can't say sure Richard Glossi is innocent.
His acts after the murder of Barry Van Treese would blame him to be a beneficiary of act.
But I think that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death judgment.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective I will see him die.
I can't claim to be real objective.
There will be other reports to which you can apply.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death.
Man talked after moist police tracking hunting to come from the Canning River
The canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
A attempt of a man from Perth to depend on the police was unfortunate when he was in the face of the water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "reasoned him to return to the bank."
The police of Canning Vale was called on Tuesday as a house-sufficiency incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, it tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I don't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited of making his uniform nass, so he turned a more reliable tactics - "A good policeman negotiated".
"Many time people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins went his car into the graves to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unfortunate, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Mood claims that Stewards tried to pioneer him and threatened to finish race sports
Peter Moody claimed that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late Scratching because of a racing day treatment, the last strawhalm on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt tube sample with Members who he cannot explain.
He had retained 18 months because of spionage forecasts and did not want it "except as too high-mounting grapes."
"I had preferred not to say anything about it, and I've had a long time on it, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything gets out at once," said Moody.
You know it's going on.
Sometimes you respond, and you must live with the consequences, and I must live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around the main, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start to think I don't do that, I shouldn't be trainers.
I have to consider what I do with my license.
Before that, Mood had given the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to pioneer his steel.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I will name when I will be asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I do within my chair," said Moody on Racing.com.
They seem to believe I'm a betrayer.
If that is the case, they should surely fall on their nose because they have failed with the attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, ehem. President of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of the RVL, was aware of it at the time and it is still today.
Should this lead me to the view that it will be personally?
Did the RVL behave feign and might people outside trainers be responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Are I bad for the industry?
Are I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people think out there, I'm it.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say will let them think about it now.
But I've now arrived at the point where I don't care about, and that makes me sad.
That makes me so sad.
I will exercise pressure on them and encourage them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer's frustration nives have built up with the long-term cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching said he could "cast his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unleashed master Black Caviar, described the racing day treatment rule "sufficiency" after a packing of slamm or sound was carried on to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
"It's against the rules of race sport.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has misleaded shame on my legs.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like that all day last night.
But it was so on the racing day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the packaging on the racing day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know about the horse.
"We see all we need rules, but here you've gone too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after driver flight
The police arrested a man on the weekend after a collapse with a cyclist and subsequent driver flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne hospital with severe injuries with a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway.
The police said the car driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50 - year - old man from Nathalia of the police office in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused for driver flight and underlying assistance and for other transport deficiencies.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital and is in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy retreats against rivals because of claims to ring fights
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy has criticized his player's counterparty as "Agenda-Setting" by two Prime League Favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the Shiedsrichter had allowed the Storm Players "Ring struggle" with his team during the high Storm Sieg in the Qualifying Finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly obvious note to the Storm team after his team had reached the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening. He called the game a "muster example" of Rugby League and said that the two of Queensland were not "to good" in rings.
Bellamy defended the tangle of his team and said that she was concentrated only on her "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers at his team is confidential to him, as it meant that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team.
"This is always up again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about ring fights when they struck us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing about our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks, we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has made the trend turning for us.
Trent has now been there for three years, and he apparently has to train a great team, so he is probably not used to lose it, so it was a bit shock for him.
It's already funny how this is always brought up again at this yeartime.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea from the "spanned football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St. George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "slow" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we look as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of soccer to play – not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it was about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks made and no points are going to make something?
It's the plans for me.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a phase.
The Storm team has free this weekend, since they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronutica Sharks next Saturday evening in the prefinal in the AAMI Park. The ticket sale starts from the next Tuesday morning.
Serbia with $200,000 Caution after drug charge
A man who may threaten a lifelong penalty because of his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled to Queensland was released against a 200,000 dollar cheese.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the Droge on the Yacht Solay, who came from South America about Vanuatu and placed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed how he met his fellow officers in the yacht port during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of Droge in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a lifelong punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the escape danger in Maksimovic.
He has clear relationships with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained the court on Wednesday.
In the case of penalty, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Macsimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a cheese of $20,000 as a security together to reach his release.
"When reading the private statements of the two people, it is clear that the edition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to keep him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against Kaution, under the conditions that he deals with his Australian and Serbian passage, resigns to the police daily and holds himself at an initial lock of 18:00-06:00.
Casualties on A5 at Karlsruhe: Leader House breaks apart
When a trip accident with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck rider has been severely injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three cars involved had burned before a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried forgotten to move left on the last moment, as the police told.
The leader's house of the accident surgery riss completely apart.

Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lock pedophile for sending images
A pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this was sleeping, logging in a online messaging service, from which he received a series of inconsistent pictures from children who were sent him by another user.
The girl waited later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusional messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police looked at this and saw the five pictures, then analysed computers found under the address and discovered "becoming" web accounts, used the terms for searching for inconsistent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "pedophile on the Internet" and he then "prefered to be a policeman to fear them."
The lawyer Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a suffice - that he was suffice to fear people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out by him on the computer, but he said it was because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to fear pedophile.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lock them.
He said he was sick in the head when he drinks and said he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at the citator and wine.
She also saw the incompatible pictures on the phone and faced the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and play station used to talk to girls who look much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the accusation to have taken unanimous images of children on 14 June last year, to have violated the obligations on 25 January this year and not to be published before court on 24 March this year.
The defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked for Hogg not to appear in the register of sexual criminals, as you can argue that "no significant sexual element" was to be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has dismissed judgment until October in order to receive background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted Cheution but was kept in investigation due to hearings with other outstanding cases.
He was recorded in the directory of sexual criminals before the judgment date.
Schleuser softened on small border transitions to Germany
More and more refugees are attacked from the major control points at the German-Eastern border.
Many Schleusers made people increased by smaller border transitions from fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, a spokesman of the Federal Police said.
During the border flow of Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been attacked in the districts Passau and Redtal people since Tuesday.
They were on foot over bridges and stauwehres on the German side.
There they are received and forwarded to registration by federal politicians.
On Wednesday, after the Federal Police Procurement Procurement, at the Munich Main Station again entered significantly more refugees on the beginning of the week.
Only until 8.00 p.m. were around 700 people arrived in the capital of the country, said a speaker in the morning.
After re-introduction of controls at the German-Eastern border, the city had reached on Tuesday 1759 refugees.
Stuttgart: Trainers of Tropensturm "Henry" in the south-west
Meteorologists warn against stormbows in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a deep pressure area across Western Europe, warm marine air flows to the country, the German weather service (DWD) shared in Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the runner of the tropical tower "Henry", which has been pulled from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past days.
Heated storms and thunderstorms are expected mainly in Baden.
According to DWD, even in the Black Forest, the Schwäbic Alb and in the soil marine circle are expected with bowers of 60 to 90 km.
On Friday the sun can be seen again.
The mass makes it: Every two years the autobuilders on the IAA show their news.
In 2015, the compact cars are particularly well sold in particular.
Cars from the compact class are currently specially asked: approximately 28.1 percent of the new authorisations were found on this segment in August only.
This also reflects on the IAA (Publicumstage 17 to 27 September).
Many new compact models are presented between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper-class and luxury cars this year.
One of the largest premiums for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be in the autumn of traders.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chef Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to ensure that the volume model is well sold, the new Astra is not to be much expensive for it.
Opel provides a rise below the largest competitive VW Golf that starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from EUR 16 990.
The Astra has a new 1,4-Liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
Hesse also offers additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, with which three cylinder benziners are the first.
Unlike the main competitive VW Golf and Ford Focus, Opel Astra is only five doors.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the combi, which is already seen on the IAA.
And what is still going on on new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra-Concurrent Mégane to the race.
At the fair, the Mégane is exclusively seen as a five door in a conventional and emphasized sports GT version.
He's going into trade at the beginning of the next year, and then as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan runner wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti fits fully into the design line of the brand with its swollen lines.
The basic model will receive a petrol engine with at least 90 kW/122 PS performance.
However, a diet with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS is also available.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premieres in Frankfurt.
Offers will be the model with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum rotation is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
Sales launch of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but around it is the compact class model DS 4, which is to be seen on the IAA.
Outside the designers of the edle Citroen-leverer mainly applied hands on the front party: here the cooler grill was redesigned and the modified lighter was equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the Infotainment System was modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and first integrated Apples CarPlay.
There is also a series of revised and new variants like the updated Mercedes A class or Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin Tile: Five square meters cells are imaginable
The Federal Constitutional Court has justified an ex-holder of the Steel Court of Justice, which had been brought into a small cell for months.
Because of the infringement of their human diges, prisoners have in principle claimed financial compensation if they are placed in too small cells.
This has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
The judges may even hope for money even if they were locked only a few days into the too tight spaces (Act: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This resulted in an ex-heavy in Karlsruhe’s constitutional case: He was put in a single cell with about five square meters of soil surface in the Berlin-speaking courtship between June and November 2009, and the toilet was not separated.
Afterwards, the man, who was now relocated on a free foot, was moved to a larger cell.
His prosecution complaint for the unworthy liability conditions against the country of Berlin was suspended.
However, the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Board Court of Justice Berlin and rejected the case for the re-examination of the Court of Justice.
You see the man's wound hurt.
Court of Auditors now decides at the level of compensation
Although, for legal reasons of the period concerned, only a few days of liability were relevant for compensation, a compensation claim would be given, it said.
Otherwise, it would be "a fear of the protection of personality".
The chamber court must now clarify the amount of financial compensation.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they first talked to a prisoner in April because he was naked into a cell.
Human innocent is a 2011 decision, too, the multiple use of a cell without a separate toilet.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had a detention of a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The applicant at that time was spent every day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell like the case in Karlsruher.
The Berlin prisons have come into the headlines over the last few weeks as a result of lack of staff.
Hence, prisoners are constantly included 23 hours, increasing aggressiveness, even to slandering it should have already come because of the stressed situation.
After the jurisdiction press office, 21 places in brick are not occupied because of the lack of adults, 19 should fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create that"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's up to Germany?
This year, about 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany, according to Vizekanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take up a million refugees.
Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated decisiveness in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create this, and we can create it".
What can be found in Germany gives the following overview.
It is used after different forecasts between 350000 (development of the Federal Ministry) and 400000 (the estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments every year - and the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it is built (250000 apartments).
The lack of living space is dramatically, however, especially in the case of affordable rent objects: annually 60000 to 80000 social housings from the rental price connection, and for these particularly favourable apartments, refugees will also apply.
Bundesbauminister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from now on 518 million to a billion euro.
It is too little for the Pestel Institute to create 80 000 social housing annually, and for this, the covenant should invest a promotion of 6.4 billion per year.
Researchers and Federal Ministry of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax advantages for housing investment.
According to estimates by the Institution for Employment and Professional Research, it is assumed that 55 percent of flavoured people in Germany can be acquired long-term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not systematically ask for their skills to help them get, Claudia Walter criticizes, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for the appreciation of the hosting society, but also for the self-value of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn in Germany: from the work ban for refugees to recognise work.
While there was an earlier ban on asylum seekers for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residual obligation to restrict asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society - also because of the lack of professional power -, the most views have been made to ensure that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster.
A large barrier for access to the labour market is missing German knowledge.
So far there is no sufficient offer for general and professional language courses.
In addition, studies show that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore viewed by Thränhardt on the king's way to work integration.
The Berlin School Management has found that only a few flew parents give their children to the Kitas, estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the discreet parents it is only very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, speaker for youth and family at the Berlin Senat Management.
However, in order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the management of handsets is distributed in different languages.
If the need for education is increased by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared for training in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Management.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no state of asylum applicants or patience prohibited the study - the only exception was until Berlin, the interior Frank Henkel (CDU) has now suspended his position.
Student refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
For refugees with a residence deposit or tolerance do not receive services under the Asylum Procurement Law more when they begin a study.
In principle, the latter do not get any charge, as they do not fall under the group of bail-lawed persons.
Patience refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be Bafig entitled, from 1 January 2016 to shortened this team to 15 months.
However, these finances must also be closed, call for Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German student work.
The students should get Bafug immediately.
Islam will play an important role in the future, for many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is important part of their identity.
The state should give the Islam sukzessive the same rights as they have the churches and further development of the existing state church right to a new state religious relationship.
It would also be important for the creation of a Islamic prosperity association, who is professionally concerned with the new procurement.
The rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam have to be able to work together with the State in many areas and to provide some control options for him.
This includes willingness to fight religious fundamentalism.
The President of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to dwell here, in Germany," he said in the Bayrian Rundfunk.
He proposed to translate the basic law to Arab.
Integration will be much more in the future than today.
In order to change the majority society, the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, an antidiscrimination body and a general equality law since a few decades.
But it is very slow, as the NSU murder series showed, the racist motif systematically ignored in the police and authorities.
The same opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the stakeholders of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements such as the anti-rassism convention of Germany have to be realised in the next years if the country remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
Generally, Germany has been able to provide medically expected refugees, doctoral president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As regards man power and capacity, we create that," he said the daily mirror.
However, additional money should flow into the system.
To avoid Engpässe, Montgomery demands to hand out all assumptions equal to the registration of health cards.
It could later be calculated with the Federal Countries.
And long-term it is highly fragile to swallow so many people with the limited performance catolog that the asylum application law prescribes.
Otherwise, doctors are making the language barriers primarily.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proved that migrants are more bad about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in doctoral practices, dolmetric costs should be taken over, they demand.
But many refugees would also be helping with more general medical approaches in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnosis view.
For example, under refugee children there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and in young people HIV-release.
With some other illness images, German doctors are clear from their training, but Montgomery says.
"Parasite accident or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect", and as regards the lack of doctors, either by the refugees, perhaps even lending in the view.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees are even doctors.
In order to practice, however, they should demonstrate their skills and may be re-experienced.
At least half of the refugees arrived in Germany is psychologically sick according to estimates of the Bundespsychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer under post-raumatic stress disorder or under depressions.
Especially harmful are refugee children, says Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study of TU Munich explains that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Those who have been diseased in post-traumatic stress disorders, among other things suffer from so-called flashbacks with breathnote, dizziness, heart rates and death fears.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong fearfulness and emotional stupidity.
In order to avoid chronic symptoms, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
However, only four percent of the psychologically ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers in social officials may request psychotherapy, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, social officials would usually decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to disadvantages, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new inszenation of "Leidenschaft" the circus tests fall back to the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to draw every age group into the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressors and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus probs into the manege on the Ziegel washing to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine that I live without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, Animal Teacher and Junior Chief.
"Leidency" - under this motto stands the current manegrance.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family probst.
The gift to the enthusiasm is therefore in the blood of the family.
"We are important to get people away from their everyday lifetime and take them with them into a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old Junior Chief stresses.
"Mangencocktail with World Town Ilair", says director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometers of tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus is convinced with talented artists around the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with widow and charme into their banners.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their handicraft.
With the heroes of the stomme films, it wants to record the Cuban duo locker.
Lightliness and moderation - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the Mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salts, the circus test’s arobatics also fascinate with finger tips and gentleness.
With the wheel on a ball balancing?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and fear at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated with its movability.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stressed Stephanies Mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disadvantages in the attitude of circus animals are only too often the subject of different animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also says: "Isn't good for our animals, it's not good for us too."
Approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroke unit.
The "four-finished artists" as they are lovingly called, will be read by the eyes, in the event of any desire.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal feels not good, it doesn't want to be in the manege.
So the top commandment: provide good for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture from a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastute, the family is probst proud.
The two animals lived eight years together in a neck and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our small Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, it is the unique maskottchen of the Circus Probst.
So for every visitor there is something to be.
"One is safe," says Stephanie Probst, "Even if five or 1 200 viewers, we always give our best and are with the whole heart."
The Circus Probst invites his ideas daily from 17 to 20 September.
On Sunday the program begins at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is family day, for the idea at 17 a.m. the prices are reduced.
The animal show is also opened daily from 10 to 18 o'clock.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader of Africa, fell down the staircase from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He stayed injured, but the case video spread quickly about social media.
The opening of the Parliament was also threatened by the opposition Members that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with calls.
In the past month, they had repaid him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of movement for democratic change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that they warned before, Mr Mugabes' speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not shown, but it has the title 'Tod'," he said journalists to Mugabes.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and, once it leaves Parliament, its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "scared" about the dangers for the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will later split itself into two stock-notified companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its service business activities.
The expected job reduction leads to a load of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a declaration.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett packard enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and Chief Executive, who should lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focus than HP is today, and we have a broad and deepened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better established than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers throughout the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been focused on more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will have been concentrated on the supply of inadequate, integrated technology solutions for companies," says a company's declaration.
It distributes a company that was founded by the Stanford University of Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s to create electrical plants and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birth place of Silicon Valley".
HP has run a massive restructuring to manage the traffic from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies worldwide, is the latest in this area based on the conviction that closely focused companies produce better performance.
FC Arsenal-Kapitän Mikel Arteta says that team colleagues must stand before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and, if his rehabilitation runs according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be able to play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and, given its history, its participation in the next summer at the European championship is still uncertain.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate knew injuries and then returned to his old swing during the preseaison.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that did not heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his knees or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from purely medical views, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the associated danger of further injuries, even if a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 plays in the last five seasons.
The broader image for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs since 2007/08 in six of eight seasons.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injuries rate will continue during the last season.
"Many time you come back from a injuries, you have a vulnerable period, a time you have to strengthen your body and win fighting force," said Wenger.
Jack's enough young to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and will pass through a career by the way he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions-League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on the coming Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nao Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance, and the players who need it to get a small snare pace," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to continue by group F, the Macsimir city in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the largest embrace effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unleashed after 41 games after the "ungiving" campaign was started in the last season.
The stadium was shot by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measured on the judge scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the teaching from the past season with the Champions-League chapitulation against Monaco and remains driven from the remote hope to lead the association to his first Europepocal triumph.
"This drive is imperfect," said Wenger.
It has never been jumped with Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in the business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar presentations in shows is evident, especially in view of how the need for men to open itself has become more desperate than ever before, how suicide rates of young men prove at a 15-year high level.
In 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men from 20 to 45 in Britain, and it remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In pursuing to address the problem, Campaigns announced against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign against an inheritance life) in 2015 as the man’s year, in order to question culture, men stop seeking help if they need them.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the fight to master this challenge.
A current study in more than 2,000 high school school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficient high percentage of friends with "less mood", his opportunities for curing doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a circle of spiritually healthy friends half the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you need to have friends so that you can work a friendship.
In the age of communication conducted on social media, with its focus on the style of substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong, vigorous and successful, even though in reality the isolation dominates.
This supervisory success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can't really buy happiness.
It was beautiful with friends that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which was shined by the interaction as a friend.
The Humor of Joey and Chandlers frequently rearmed, moments in the football bag in cozy seals and the sehnsucht from Ross to Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can relate to any case, even if they often retain their feelings.
As a person of telephone care explained me, "my listening role for people who feel depressive and suicided, has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old talk "I am up to it" has an enormous effect, how the feeling that it is observed as a weakness when talking about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that come in mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective external state over the phone can help people in moments of despair, which is long-term support from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the entirely redesigned culisse for the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink at the Central Perk.
Or, even better if you see someone around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and tell Hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the whole 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG to malmill malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his meeting against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö in the prince park stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Debüt as a PSG player who brought the French master to the road, but then they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani reached a headballtor in the 61th minute.
With real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in the A group, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as it is not only pursuing the skills for the K.O. Rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, there was no classic game with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's chances missed in front of the gate. He was later alternated in the game against his home city team and against the association with which he started his illustr career already in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or outward in the Champions League. It is therefore a good start to win 2:0, to cause our opponents to cause problems and relax, even if there are certain things we need to perfection over the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we have won, although I was worried that we haven't reached one or two more gates."
Ibrahimovic returned after his infringement in one of three changes to the Paris team, which was able to keep a 2:2 distinctions on his own place against Bordeaux in the first Liga, but he was exhausted in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The architectian wing tower was called the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United, and he demonstrated why when he lived in Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he ended beautifully to Johan Wiland in the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, arrived at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But except a shot of Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far to Kevin Trapp's poos in the 34th minute, they offered little attack.
Instead, PSG himself was sometimes suspended, with some failures and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who was suspended in the first half alone when he was not less than five trials alone and then abandoned after the restart of Cavani.
Yet he proved much more fun when he brought his players to play, and it was a passage of Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria changed to a rotation committee, which was passed by Wiland in the 52. minute at the Pfost ...
The second gate was finally falling shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayn reached its sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic had exposed a left flank of Maxwell.
This finished all the thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention of Wiland from shortly distance to stop David Luiz, the final result could be low before the spare player Ezequiel Lavezzi was known a gate at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class about his team, and Norweger said: "Our last champions-League game was last year in December.
Since then, we have played only in Swedish Liga, which does not have the same level.
The skills games are not sufficient."
Get out of Paris!

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 Switch to FC Bayern
World and Europe Championshiper Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was evidently a few years ago the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona at that time.
Eight times Spanish master, three times Pokal Sieger, four times Champions-League-Sieger, two club World Champion Champion Champions-League-Sieger, two times World Champion Champion Champion Champion Champion, two times World Champion Champion Championshiper, two times Europe Championshiper, one time World Championshiper - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer the 35-year-old now left the FC Barcelona and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Katar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now advises that he was already before EM 2008 before the Abschied of Barcelona.
"You told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at that time, we don't know," he says.
And that also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer of Bayern."
"Rummy wanted me."
To remember: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not switch
But the change did not stand.
And the challenging man for this today works for the German record manager: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why, "Barça has contracted Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"Then he won me."
Who knows how Bayern's time of playing 2008/2009 would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the Champions League's quadrantfinal against the Bavaria across the entire distance on the race, slain reds out (4:0, 1:1) and feathered at the end the King Class-Triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in the film creation
Matt Damon confronted the Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity and said that she would not need behind the scenes.
During a series of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight interrupted the experienced actress Brown, when this emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected rotation book of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then do it in order of the film and not in ordering the show," Damon assured.
Brown responded shocked, with insulted unbelievers and called " Hoo! Wow. OK," when the comments of The Martian held.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show lists.
"I would like to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of the harmony," Brown first said.
The only black person, and it is a nut that is hit by her white holder.
The manufacturer of Dear White People set up for the finalists Leo Angenlos and Kristen Brancaccio for the Registry Rights at the film; Damon replied that their regime could "at the end give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was exploded, social media exploded from misapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter users Mr. Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts".
The second deserved more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since his publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when the media's exact racic representation is at the top of the social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown had been killed by a white policeman in 2014, the movement of Black Live's Matter achieved a wide range of effects and encouraged lawmakers and authorities to address discrimination practices against colorful content.
In February, the singer Prince made an indication of the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (albs still have their significance) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
During the past, leaders of the Black Live's Matter movement have published a declaration as a response to the question of the Fox-News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as a hate group.
"The Network Black Lives Matter is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, Damon was announced that there was a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule that are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or already taken the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' King first Champion
Profi-sport climbers and service aid Isaac Caldiero became the first athlet who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the great price of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just concluded its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participants who could end all stages of his obstacle parcour.
During the season, two men, Caldiero and Cameramann Geoff Britten, created to the finale.
The last task was the climbing at a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, which he was the first athlet, who completed the striving phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge full of three seconds, making him a winner.
Caldiero talked to E! News after the hard battled victory, still under the shock over the profit of the Great Price of 1 million dollars.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than 100,000 dollars or had to live," said Isaac E! about his hop money.
So quite suddenly .. as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed went with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why British, although he first completed the parcours, did not receive any price money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets that one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful price and changes life, it receives the great greetification.
I don't think he's got any guilty about it.
He's just done so happy to do what he did.
He received masses of awards from Fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be slaughtered by someone, I am glad that it is Isaac."
And I think Isaac had felt the same if they had exchanged the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for a eighth staff, the turning will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers go to Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-- The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tigers.
Earlier they were one of the best teams in the Baseball, today the tigers stand on the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, but this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins deceived a chance to rise within a play court of Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-Wort, which was so difficult over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins make fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon held his early open support when Detroit pointed three times in the first two innings, then in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) killed 6 times in the third innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to quit strong this year," said Simon.
It's hard to throw into each game in the Bullpen, and so I'd be very concentrated in the game.
The designed Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid August.
It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the woods," said Ausmus.
He looked well at the (Schlagtraining), looked clearly better in the Bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to come back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the Inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colour, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the strike before he was replaced by the left hands of Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived wall, the only man he was faced with, before the designed Rukie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who has a two-run distributed to the right hand of Drew.
With a couple of runners and the finish-run at the second, the third baseman Trevor Plouffe led to a double play.
It was that in the Major League leading 27 times in this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance race at the end of the ninth inning, Mhuer created a RBI double against the closer of the Tigers Bruce Ronton and reached the stand of 5-4.
However, the right hands set Sano at three pitches for its fifth saving.
Detroit benefited from a non-movable Phil Hughes to act on the game.
The tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right-hands veteran, which had been deleted by the infected list before the game, after he had missed more than one month for a relapse.
"Of course not the beginning I wished," said Hughes, "but I felt better than I left out and felt that I would create some very good pitches there in the third inning."
After they received the Leadoff-Batter, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game that created a single "up the middle" in the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in Scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended.
The tigers agreed in the second, a one-out doubled by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single of Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big hit," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't particularly beat well, but he's got the right place.
Hughes was located in a Pitch count, did not reach any points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Relief Rights A.J.Achter.
In Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a roll with four strikes.

Several sports halls of the Hessian capital were prepared for this case in the past days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be undergone temporarily there.
They will then be distributed to other communities.

Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The Head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria.
"I think the decisive reflection on military action options should not take place without Germany," he said.
He warned the European States "collektive way to look".
Four years ago, it was rejoiced that the chick of military participation in Germany has passed away.
"Now the conflict lands crazyly before our door," he said in Germany radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase in international assistance on the place of refugees.
Austria controlled at southern and east borders
After Germany, Austria has also reinforced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner explained in the Austrian TV ORF on Tuesday evening, no one is now being sent back to Hungary.
Germany has also not sent refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mic-Leiter said that there have already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and Representatives of Germany.
She did not call concrete numbers and referred to conversations in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria over the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is usually Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann requested a special summit for the next week with several other EU Heads of State and Government.
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU States have not yet been able to have a common action in the crisis.
The EU Ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of other 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday (22 September).
In view of the strong refugee resort in Germany, the covenant wants to support the countries in the first-up and distribution of people.
The covenant will manage this together with the countries, and Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four-hour consultations with the President of the Kanzler Office in Berlin.
It is noted that those people who need protection commit them too.
However, those who have no staying perspective cannot remain in Germany either.
This view was finally divided into the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now operate a "spiritual effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed his 175 kilometers long border to Serbia in the evening to Tuesday.

The Romanian government condemned the plan immediately.
There were first arrests of people that had cut the magic.
As a result, there were thousands of other migrants on the road to the Greek border in Turkey.
Room health "Cassini" finds Ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice team of the Saturnmond Enceladus, a global ocean swallows.
This closes researchers from observing the space health "Cassini".
After that, the moon gets slightly torque on his train around the ring planet.
Although this deaf movement is only small, but still too large for a continuously fixed sky body, it says in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State of New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis in the "Icarus" section.
For more time, it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice blanket of Enceladus.
Thus "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcano at the south-pol of the Saturnmond in 2006, spiting water vapour and ice particles and thus feeding the so-called e-Ring of the Saturn.
At least on the South Pole there must be an underground sea, astronomers then closed.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama lacks 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to refrain from Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has resulted in an infringement of the 27-year-old, the association shared.
Rama had already begun pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Lion, the diagnosis means "continuously four weeks of forced pace".
"It's hard for us, Rama's a big loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said Sports Director Necat Aygün of the "image" newspaper in view of the possible commitment to an ununanimous professional.
However, as a training gas, the Sechzigers first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was active in Belgium and was already under contract at VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatians currently have "the opportunity to prove his ability."

No diet fruit - Mangos contains a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slim line is often more distorted by them.
Because Mangos contains relatively much sugar - especially saccharosis.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: B vitamins and vitamins E and C are in them. Above all, Mangos contain lots of vitamin A and its pre-stage Beta-Carotin.
Those who eat the fruits, thus supports vision, immune system, and metabolism processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly.
The scale color alone doesn't say anything about how mature the fruit is - so green Mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste purely or in sweet foods.
A Mango also gives a special note to hearty courts.
It milds the slightly bitter taste of some sheet salads like Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangoutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.

First firing tower, then markant Kaltfront
In the coming night, in the valleys of the Alpine north side of the feathers, the meteoeshess were told on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and the night to Thursday, the feather leaves partly with storm strength through the feathers.
After waging on Thursday morning, a marked cold face crosses us with strong rainfall, windbows, and temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of a large deep pressure area over the British islands in a strong Southwest flow.
On the alpine side, the throats blew through the valleys in the night to Wednesday.
As a result, the feathers blew in the feathers with floors of 60 to 100 km/h, individually and in particular in the country of origin also with more than 100 km/h.
The feather can make up to the neighbouring country, and on the mountains even orcanbows are possible from over 120 km/h.
During the north of Wednesday, the humidity of the Alpine Smooth begins to rising from 23 to 27 degrees.
Here's rain that keeps up until Thursday evening.
In the sum of the Alps in the next 48 hours, with some more than 100 litres of rain per square metre, this after large rain volumes have fallen in recent days.

Rome now has a Martin-Luther-Platz
Knapp 500 years after the reformation, there is now a Martin-Luther-Platz in Rome.
In the presence of the city president Ignazio Marino, a so-called place in the park was baptized on Wednesday on the Oppio-Hügel on the name of the German Reformator.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as "German Theologe of Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the colosseum.
The nameization was requested by the work community of evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical-Lutheric municipality in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants could often live their faith in the city of the Pope over centuries as minority.
The place is symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) held in Rome as a young Augustine monk around 1510/11 a few months.
He received the city at that time as an innocent sin babel.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
After that, Luther had launched the division of the eveninglands church with his thesis against the delegation trade.
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (olden) Dornenkrone is one of the main works Otmar Old for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar Alt Bibel, which has now appeared with funny pictures.
At the beginning, the image for Otmar Alt, formed its entire personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colors and fantasy shapes has received the 75-year-old - but that is not equivalent to "lusty" images.
On the contrary, adapting the respective topics may be very dark.
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he had made a subjective artistic selection of the many topics of the "book of all books".
Entities are cyclones who convey topics such as crossway, plagues, commandments or fathers.
In this way, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to Luther's edition with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-declaration with its focus on artbooks.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has interfered with the respective Bible posts on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated in current relationships" today.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between Martin Luther's original bibel citate and each of the artists who form his very personal thoughts about the respective situation here.
The jewelry band has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old just twice allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Eventually, emotions have been invaded for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belongs to the strict Protestant Lord's order.
"There happened education with the pipestock again," Otmar Alt remembers.
"I have tried to work this in order to get me back to the Lord's father."
His second concern is to help the art again to make more job-value in a fast time: "The perception of image worlds is characterized by embellishment today, and it is loud.
Symbolic is endured there.
Artists have another pleasure and wish to show things.
Pictures always have something mystery and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to "inflame" in the images, discover, and feel the strength they have: "The image looks for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of Otmar Alt-Bibel in Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "soever" was a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands with his images life".
Old did not take care of full account of the Bible but chosen the important, also mystery topics for him.
"This was not a collaboration at eye," says Altepost, "this is about the images the text simply explains".
For Hans Möhler from Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "develop his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and the responsibility.
One part of the original - paper and canvas images - is first presented in an exhibition opened in the Otmar Alt Foundation on 15 November.
Construction start for BMX track near
Planning, finding space, commissioning companies, modelling grounds for a round course: A year later, almost everything was finished - yet before the official opening of the BMX bus was again concluded.
Disasters in politics and administration provided for disturbance, especially for residents who didn't want to duld the train.
So swing down hills, seeking new place - now with formal planning and application for construction approval.
In October, the first municipal council Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to inform the children's and youth committee.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started without a more "wide memorial pace" with the work at the former swimming pool.
DFB intensifys commitment for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend.
The soccer reacts to the situation in Germany and ensures its help in addressing the problems in question.
"I think this for the greatest challenge of our country since the reconciliation."
"In principle, nobody can say, that's nothing about me, I don't have anything to do with it."
"This must interest each individual to get this topic in the handle," said DFB-Chef Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am next Wednesday at the Kanzler Office and there is the Minister of State, Mrs. Özořuz, and the Chancellor."
"The topic will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The soccer can and want to help.
The decisive weighing must, however, be a policy.
The German football covenant has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.
"The Egidius Braun Foundation has made sure that this programme continues until 2019," said Niersbach on the edge of the UEFA Day in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federalists also support this programme.
At this weekend, 36 professionals set a clear sign when they will carry the print "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left tricotair instead of the otherwise common sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that all of them should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusen's sports head Rudi Völler of the "Image" newspaper (Serviceag) and described the project as "Seaturity".
"The refugee Drama goes on everybody, no one can look away."
"We can have soccer bondists, no, we need to use our radius power, our influence, and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so unbelievable," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the Liga".
The national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the EM-Qualification Game against Hungary on this Friday.
Niersbach called the support of refugees as a "a large Community work of German soccer".
That all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects, would be great.
It is equally great that smaller and smallest groups are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, will live in the soccer.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, provides EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already obtained the total sum for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Chief for accidents loses an eye
The Chief of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost several reports by a sturz at the beginning of July.
At the staircase in the house of his brother in the United States, he would have fallen to a water glass that he had worn in the left hand, the "business week" reported on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeded, was unmighty, then he slew out on the street - that's what he told us this last week," quotes the "WiW" SAP founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could go after his work.
"Start of October we meet before the Supervisory Board in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager is at the meeting and "perfect working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "South German newspaper" (Thursday edition) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software groups.
"I am full for SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I stood regularly in contact with the Supervisory Board and his president Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually runs between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP centre in Walldorf.
He is important to go to the public with such a personal story, said the manager of the "SZ": "This can happen to him."
"But it is important to stand up again when you've fallen down."

Football: BVB without reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europe League have definitively broken.
The national player will also lack the table leader of the soccer covenant in Duell with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 am/Sky).
"We are unfortunately unable to take back to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen, the BVB coach opened: "We expect a return from him to the training on Friday."
In view of the high burden of his professional, Tuchel will not change his tribe on the reus position only.
So he announced a change in the gatekeeping position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of tribekeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trained on a absolute top niveau," praised the football teacher to the World Championshiper.
The use of Weidenfellers in the future in all Europe-League games, but Tukel opened.
With a high probability, he will also contradict the second party.
The research statement by Mitplayer Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal of being the target, is that central field player Julian Weigl believes that "Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Roboter cars: Government wants to pre-reach for Germany
Germany is intended to be technical advancer according to the will of the Federal Government in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Bundeskabinett decided a strategy paper from the house of transport minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, provides investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair of a "new mobility age".
The automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stood, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the topic with his office colleagues from the G7 countries, which are also co-operation with industrial representatives.
The transport Ministry's strategy paper emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a swift turnover to digital radio.
In order to test new technology, a test track at the motorway 9 in Bayern is currently created.
In order to allow the driver to be given "no additional liability risks," the Federal Government wishes to "check and adjust, where necessary, to the new developments".
Thus, about internationally, Germany wants to increase the maximum speed of self-driven cars from 10 to 130 pm.
The Federal Government also wants to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention, which is only a driver for human beings.
When automated driving, the car takes over the lead increasingly, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based on sensors and cameras that cover the environment and process data in seconds.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automated driving on carways will be technically possible until 2020.
However, driving-free vehicles on public roads were to be "for the first time after 2020".
The value added in the field of driverassistance systems and high-automated driving functions at the location of Germany appreciates the authors of the study for 2025 to about €8.4 billion.
"The digital network of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD transport policy Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-driving cars still see skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey submitted on Wednesday on the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Dekra Test Organization comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will be carried out in the next ten years, 32 percent will only count to it in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it.
In France 21 percent of the interviewed to 2025 are expected by autonomous cars, 33 percent in the US.
In addition, the car drivers in Germany are not ready to leave completely on a self-driving vehicle.
After an survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to give control on all roads during the entire journey.
On the carway, it could ever imagine 15 percent in the flow of transport, 45 percent in the stau.
Good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at tabletennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to retain only in a single position for the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to be taken at the latest on 22 September.
"This is a giant loss for our team."
"The guys have experienced it in the morning."
"We are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßhead during the EM-Lehrgang in Düsseldorf.
Boll was at that time at the flight to a long-term agreed sponsoring date in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Ohne Timo is the disadvantage, we're no longer so a clear favorite," said single-European master Dimitry Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who launched the setlist in Jekaterinburg, also remembered the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Then Timo has missed, and we have become European Championshipers."
"Daran should oriente us," said the world rankings five.
Luke Shaw's English football national player from Manchester United has become severe injuries on the right leg.
At the Champions-League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defendant was hit with a attack of Héctor Moreno and changed after long treatment.
The first diagnosis showed a breakthrough during the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaulter feel too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figurative grey cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaulier (63) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday.
The highlights: spectacles that look terrible thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, which, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits, and so that he was hiding men in Romans.
"I can't say today that I'm the enfant terrible of the skin couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was bleed, now it's really," said Gaulier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Citizens-steign at the runsteg), which can be seen at the mortar of the Hypo culture, it is a luck that the fashionmaker has changed his first refusing position on a view about his person.
Actually, he was opposed, because, "For me, a exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
If you die, you're going to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man's hardly too overlooking work that wrote the fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork for which much effort has been made: for example, a stylist has been engaged in to eat the puppets.
14 tons of material carrted the machers according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of October festival, there was a special dirt: a leather-hosen-outfit with Corsett.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are slimmer than men") and said for people who are a little different, Gaulier.
Gaulti's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, sawful modern hearing tests of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in the soccer) he attracted his Teddy BHs and dress, said Gaulier.
To play with a pope, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
Later, he taught himself the design of fashion.
He stealed fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaulter told in Munich.
But later I bought them naturally.
For his first own fashion show, he couldn't pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the climats.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze as fashion-nic
Earlier, it went to the long sticking machines and to make plows for measuring.
The coated substances and tips developed in large amounts for customers, for example, which they further processed to covers and gardines.
This only does not work today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, the fashion is again important.
In the early times of the top of the Plauene fashion played a greater role, then the home textile industry has been endured - and is now discovered as a niche.
Reinhardt calls some examples: top in jewelry, in accessories such as bags and in regional trucks.
Overall, the so-called vintage mode, which rejects past style pockets, is a growing job potential.
Those in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us they already make half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauener Spitze and embroidery association.
Only they may wear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, around 80 percent of the sales have been broken away.
Private businesses and the wholesale trade are almost no longer available.
Our products are hardly reaching the customer in this way.
The mass products will be much cheaper in Asian space today and almost exclusively distributed through chains.
Moreover, export weakens, currently to Russia and the USA.
So enough reasons for new paths.
The industry engagement is also trying to focus on environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year we lead a quality seal that shows that we produce ecological and socially tolerantly".
Reinhardt supplements: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diplomdesigner Ute Schmidt teaches at the snowberger outdoor site of the West Saxon University Zwickau - at the Faculty for Applied Art - and is specialized on embroidery and tips.
In order to counteract competition from Asian space, you must find high-quality and innovative products.
That needs time and courage.
It creates a field of tension between the most fresh ideas of the designer and the businesses that must especially think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only easy to vary in order to keep a customer tribe.
Some years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter renewed the historic snowball tip.
In some places, the machine holds small bullets.
The Plauener Goldschmiedemeisterin Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by: "I couldn't start anything with traditional Plauener tip."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an experiencing procedure, she presents the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme Plauener's top - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers into the United States, Australia and Finland - especially customers whose prerequisites lived in plues and surroundings and who want a memorial piece.
This way I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener tip.
Disney plant new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends shouldn't touch, but Disney still waits for a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not a new film, but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical children's girl.
It is about the experience of Nanny with the family Banks in times of the World Economic Crisis in England.
Who plays Poppin's more than 50 years after July Andrews is still unclear.
But the director already stands firm: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges the economy to open more wide for the world
The economy has to open itself more widely to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group who was commissioned with the governance of the reform.
"China should use itself to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business-growing strategies," he said in a talk at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting curriculums and promoting reforms will bring up new vibration and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access regulations, discharge of border control policy, promotion of public undertakings (SOE), private capital and rehabilitation of the population's data system.
According to the Statement, a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies which are not in question for investment.
The system is tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it grants the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, guarantees a legal business environment and open-to-market, said the Statement.
The government will also lock controls on the powers conferred on the firms and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The Statement also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In the framework of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment are opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign financed companies and provide better services for them," said the Statement.
In addition, it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right to guarantee the lawyers to exercise their activities and to implement professional judges and lawyers, has also been discussed at a meeting.
At the meeting, too, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli participated, as reported in a declaration published after the meeting.
EU wants to double Quecksilver limit value in Raubfish
The European Commission wants to double the limits for Quecksilver in large Raubfish, thus ensuring a significant higher dose of nervous gift.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which is a corresponding EU work paper, criticized the plans sharply: "Risics and adverse reactions of inducated industrial and environmental policy are extended with full growth in pregnant and small children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt by Foodwatch.
Wolfschmidt, according to the limits of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as Hai or Sword fish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large Raubfish are already so strongly charged with mercury that, on the basis of the still applicable limit values, some 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold.
After duplicated limit values, only 14,5% would be uncoverable.
In contrast to this locking, the EU according to foodwatch wants to increase the limits in other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
But food watch referred to this as "trick", because smaller peace fish, such as carpfes are usually so low that they already maintain the planned maximum values.
Therefore, the reduction in small fish would be "a perfect retirement manoeuvre that helps the economy alone," said Wolfschmidt.
Quecksilver is a high-toxic heavy metal for people, which is strongly enriched by the food chain in Raubfish.
Therefore, the Federal Government warns that "may cause small quantities especially in unborn damages of the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on his homepage with regard to the highest values applicable, but it is not expected to expect a "personal hazard of the general population".
Quecksilver is mainly in the environment through carbon burning.
The German coal power plants are cast out more than six tonnes of quecksilver in the year, two third of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of Quecksilver in fish, such as Elbe, Rhine and Danube, would be "during and surface covering," had quoted the "spiegel" from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe's warnings on mercury in fish have already been the most frequent health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
