Food debt to European Inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is to increase the rapid increase in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the Eurozone the tender was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have passed from only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian notesbank, the European Central Bank (EZB) has not reduced the leadership, as it considers that interest reduction would benefit the increasing raw materials prices and the slightly decline in unemployment.
The ECB is striving to keep the inflation rate less than two percent or at least just at least at the two-percentive brand.
According to analytic, the ECB finds itself in the Zwickmühle: the inflation must be "closed" in order to exclude the need for action later.
With 3.3% the inflation rate reached a 12-year record height in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1%.
The increased food and energy prices were responsible for increasing inflation in the euro area.
MATIF notes increased by 88 percent, and the course for soya beans also reached a record height since 1973.
Also in food oil and milk products there was a significant tendency in 2007.
The world market price for raw oil increased by 52 percent this year - in the last month the price per fascination of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, the inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it is calculated to be 1.9 per cent.
For the next 3-4 months, analytics are going out of a 3-procent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect that the ECB will reduce the interest rate twice.
Gallup or government crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathisants has grown significantly until early December. The party has the largest base camp since 2002, while the consent for the socialists according to Gallup has reached a never-day depth of 13 percent.
The difference of the opposition supporters due to the high determination of the opposition supporters is clear: More than two thirds (71 per cent) represent a fiveth (20 per cent) consent for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are according to the survey under the Parliamentary rise-in-debt: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party selectors has grown by one percent in both stores.
Compared with the last point, the general economic vote has further deteriorated - yet never before was the proportion of those who assessed the economic situation of the country as "explicitly bad", so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent considers it "shamefully bad".
After hopefully more prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change of their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population are calculated with a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is of improvement.
A Gallup survey carried out in December revealed that 71% of the surveys - a historical high - assessed the work of the Prime Minister as "deadly as justice".
Threeteen percent of the interviews have made great trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of the supporters for Viktor Orbán 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of the government at all, compared with 27% infants against the party head of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political abstention is the number of those who think that we could get the unreasonableness with the President of the Minister, without any change in government.
According to the unrest in the past October, 35% of the government’s stay and the head of the government, this share is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) see the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the vote, 60 percent answered that they would participate "with security" and give another 20% their vote "probably".
To compare: Parliament's elections would take place on this Sunday, only 55 percent "with security" would go to the ears, another 15% would think their participation for "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the national vote would be absorption.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee and 84% against the hospital day fee.
The group of participating in the people's agreement would even amount 81, 84, or 89% of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees.
Also at the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost one fiveth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörse trade area have also maintained this year the average price increase of 16% of the last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Trade Triangle, the price of the usual Christmas corbes of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but prices were registered in all hypermarkets of over 1,000 HUF.
After the prices in food markets have been "devongalopported" last December, the teuring has not been dramatically exposed, compared with the very high, previous starting level.
However, it is definitely devastating on consumers that this year, for which they had paid far below 9.0 HUF, is not even available for 100,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 100,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and living fish remained nearly at the previous level, however, strongly increased the prices for Putenbrustfilets, Nuss and Mohn.
Prices for meal and bread comprised the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, however, there were 1kg bread vessels for 139 Forint.
There was no competition-related price in the product at less than 200 forint.
Also surprised here was the price of a two litres of Coca-Cola Pfand bottle of less than 200 forint, so the drink included Pfand was only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping comparison Also at the most expensive, and Cora is the most affordable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" basket compared to Christmas prices last year by 15 years, while Tesco and Evenan increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the past year and the expensive rate of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1.206.00 forint in the previous year, but the VAT increase in prices was noted at last Christmas.
This process has made trade arguing: it seems that the goods houses could not be justified to decide the price margin they should apply in the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were indispensable.
(If the merchant plans the speed of a product, it can fall by significant profits in the price margin addressed by transport intensity.)
In the past year, the most expensive corb exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, while the price different from the cheapest corb was just 844 forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive corb cost more than in the previous year, and even when the cheapest, there was a price increase of 1.284.00 forint.
Compared with the two last Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase showed that the price of the daily consumption items in the hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily confirm the dates of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: in some basic nutritional products, the Statistical Office established more than 30% of the tendency during the period of 12 months.
As in about Mehl as well as eggs.)
However, a look at the "Napi" shopping cart seems to be almost impossible at the last, as the price level of the product has risen by little more than 10 percent in the worst case in the previous year.
Apparently, meal suppliers are in a stronger position than the suppliers - they were able to turn the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarket is not accused; it is reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses no longer look at the prices.
There are large quantities of purchased, permanent foods go in pallets over the shoptic.
Wednesday morning morning, there were endless snakes in all three goods houses at the cass when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, it is reported by the country that many multis complain to the researchers that they could not even reach the planned sales, not only in food, but also in sustainable consumption goods.
Many places are spurred on disinfectants
Today, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals that were due to inadequate handling with antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the transfer of beds, the overloading of the staff - all factors that are not just administerable to the indulge of infections, the governing doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many places are also preserved in disinfectants.
A MRSA infection has recently been diagnostic in the János Hospital department.
The antibiotic resistant bacteria was found in a male patient who was delivered into hospital after severe accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The infringement of a heavy car accident was released from the hospital, but little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation has not been done since then because of the bacteria that is still in the body of the patient.
Until December 10, this year, the hospitals were reported 1094 by multi-resistant infected infections to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, said the governing doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many, multi-resistant infects caused by multi-resistant infects have been registered in hospitals with safety, but the dark-sciper may be higher.
Some two third of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, the resistant Staphylococcus aureus against Methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carrys about one third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as neck inflammation, male inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well healable.
However, if the means are too highly dosed or inappropriately applied, the well responding bacteria resistors of antibiotics that are quickly spreading under corresponding conditions in hospitals.
In particular, in patients with weak, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older or low body weight patients, these bacteria can cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. Sepsis.
According to János Hospital head, the MRSA infection is not special, such incidents belong to the hospital.
The infection is not changed with the epidemic, but Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is not there only where it is not searched.
Resistant against antibiotics
"Sole patients are isolated, the nurse person carrys rubber hand shoes and masks in care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment" - so Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are studied at MRSA during their delivery to hospital, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Excess of samples too rare
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are inappropriate for the indampment of the origin or the spread of the multiresistant stimulator, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and homes of age, the spitals should examine the injured patients and immediately isolate MRSA.
However, the microbiological intake of samples is not so often practiced in the Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no grants for this investigation from the public health corporation.
The most cases, therefore, are only the daylight only when the patient has a significant MRSA infection, the medical director of the Epidemiology Centre.
From the European Union, there are strict recommendations to apply antibiotics in human medicine, but in Hungary there are also directives on the treatment of certain infections and illness images.
Antibiotic therapy is intended to be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary to avoid resistence against the means, but this directorate of hospitals will not always be maintained.
Ambulants, or primary care patients include microbiological samples even rarer, says Karolina Böröcz.
The disinfectants are separated
Scientific evidence indicates that MRSA is transmitted by a patient to the other most frequently by the nurse person.
That is why hand washing, or wearing handles and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by trucky infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patients.
The rooms are even often overpowered, the beds are very close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from epidemiological view.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately in the less well-formed hospitals, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that benefit from the development of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less frequent there, and the further spread of the stimulant can be maintained where these protection measures are held, says Karolina Börcz.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infections to be handled cause the health insurance to have enormous costs, so they are fighted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their imposition in the Government Programme, was observed.
According to first signs, the programme is successful - as publicly published, the trend of MRSA infections in England is deteriorated.
The European Center for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the development of multi-resistant stimulators (i.e. MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities.
Death Lenker Police Chief wasn't drunk
In the case of the autocommittee caused by the police head of the XXII district, the official advice now occurs.
Attila Morvai, press speaker of the Budapest Super State prosecutor on Friday after the official advice was submitted.
The advice confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the head of the police had not consumed alcohol before he put himself on the tax.
The former head of police bog with his own car in XXII. District to the Kossuth Lajo's street and has passed over an 55-year-old man, who crossed the street on a not marked place.
(Laut StVO, however, this is not a milder condition - the steering driver has, even if pedestrians do not cross the street on the cerebral strip .)
The pedestrian is laying his injuries after his delivery to the hospital.
According to police reports, the Lenker suffered a shock, then put his functions back and asked for a pension.
The Budapest State Prosecutorship has launched its investigations.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former head of police had cooperated with the mediators from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister for Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three credit agreements in Boedapest total value of EUR 400 million.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund in 2006.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan contract will also be applied to the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining 150 million euros will be decided later under the extension of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, contract partners have signed an agreement over EUR 50 million, which are mainly flown into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, too, the U-Bahn Line 4 came to be language.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has cleared the details of the U-Bahn financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications are re-established.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan rates are EURIBOR, the loan is provided free of charge by the EIB with an increase of 8 years.
Bulgaria, the EU’s real estate paradies
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all Europe looks attention to the earlier rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the most cheap market in the EU, which will be more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently unquestionably the most popular plaster for real estate purchases in the Eastern European room, with cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sonne Coast", and the historical towns of Sozopol and Nessebar, but real estates around Kavarna and Balcik are ever asked.
According to reviews of Re/Max Analysten in Bulgaria, the country's intent was also attracted earlier or later investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the most affordable area of Russian.
The capital of Sofia also offers luxury offers - commercial and office areas offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is to become on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradies, thus attracting tourists in the other seasons next to the summer and winter season.
So predicting investors are already buying in large style, for example around Bansko.
Analytics say that people who acquired in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their course of life.
Most buyers are English countries, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are predominantly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to leave themselves buy either revitalized property by EUR 50-100.000 or downcoming houses by EUR 5-15.000 that they renovate themselves.
Good connection and reachability as well as communication options are largely written, but also close to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a vacation domain (Bulgaria was listed under the Top Ten Destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group creates businesses that invest with the aim of a medium- to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital will, however, become more expensive, due to the growing demand.
Within the EU the real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there was a price increase by 21 percent per year.
The cost of the real estate prices exceeds mostly the increase of the holders.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As environmental minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the Ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise the plan of Bali, where emissions reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto protocol, are determined.
There is currently a serious debate between industrial and developing countries.
The United States have already signaled that they do not want to negotiate specific figures, but they would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether industrial countries are ready to support both the developing countries financially and technically, along with reducing emissions.
There was also an agreement on the support of developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol's adjustment fund is intended to be managed by a 16-year-old Council, expected to be read by the UN Global Environmental Facility (GF) as is read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary six percent
Environmental Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its prerequisite role in global climate change measures and to achieve a new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will be able to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 20% until 2020 (as measured in 1990), regardless of whether the "convenience after 2012" will be successful or not. The Union would even be willing to apply for a 30-procent reduction, provided that other major industrial countries in the world, or developing countries are also ready to comply with their obligations according to forces and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the targets of the countries which were joined by the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 were a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, while the EU had already committed to a minimum of 8% with its 15 Member States at that time.
The standard for Hungary is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87, which will meet the country as it is read in the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The use is high to Bali - although the long-term international climate policy agreement has to be completed within two years, otherwise it would be in force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be renewed, followed by the international emissions reduction system, whose importance would also have highlighted the IPCC, the international, with the Nobel Prize of Scientific Climate Climate Commission of the UN in its recent report.
This would reduce emissions reduction, and the increase in earth’s average temperature by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, according to scientists, would be extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British army jumps on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published records on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for popularity increase on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) YouTube has discovered: Since March 2006, special units have been stationed in Afghanistan are loading videos via the network against Taliban, reports the BBC.
The miniature cameras that are tied on the helmets are controlled at the air weapon base in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed to the Internet.
Political Message Unavoidable
Soldiers of the air weapon have already controlled 139 such records, their "channel" has been considered more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces stationed in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Implementation in Afghanistan
Originally, the air weapon has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defense, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the people about the actual objectives of foreign revenue.
Such a kind of propaganda published is almost free in comparison to conventional television applications, so defensive Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, but these videos are always wearing a certain degree of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
American Raising With Game
However, the army must also fight against asmateur recordings, which, next to the carefully processed, also create certified records into the network - such as those who show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are highly spoken, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
From the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, many videos have already been loaded on the platform, but the British have discovered for themselves just recently.
The Americans, however, are throwing on the something different, with the free downloadable shooting game "American Army", in which the player can swallow into the soldier’s skin within a more or less life-satisfactory simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministry
Minister Johannika Lamperth is no meek: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organises a working conference in which her employees can suspend the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other beautiful Christmas agreements with Tombola or stirrings in the official hearts.
Some, Christmas agreement, concerts and buffet - so celebrates the power.
The Christmas fever has already recorded the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a Ministry will be held in the defense resort, but the ministerial staff will not be expected to do so.
In the "Weiachtsviering of Waisen" children are defeated by fallen soldiers, with the "Mission celebrations" family members are currently operated by foreignly stationed soldiers, but there is also a press reception.
The resort provides around 25 million for celebrations.
In comparison with other resorts, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport propose the stress.
4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economics will be held in the home of the future, some 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tobola loss.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) has held its 4.7 million Forint teure Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a festival.
The hallmiete was 1 million forint, the rest was issued for the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ department is also invited in another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU elders.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater was rented ("Vígszínház").
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information as we have not reached the constraints.
What's the attraction?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay any rent to the OIT for the use of the spaces.
Some 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a minister's speech, after which dinner there were live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], one reported: there was no ball-clothing or attraction obligation on the ball.
Ministers for Health, Work and Self-Manage shall prepare for puritarian celebration.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour's work Mountika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas celebration but to the conference for the annual era.
You are calculated with about 180 guests, which - so the press department - are only covered by coffee and pogats, so the celebration is out of 350,000 forint.
Self-administration Minister Gordon Bajnai will simply attack with his colleagues in the Aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas celebration in its own festival where 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured by 2.500 forint per head - for this money there is a buffet receipt with the following injuries.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, employees of the PM celebrate in this way each year.
However, there will be no right party vote - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was held for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites a new year's reception on the 20th century, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry is falling out this time.
The one hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the origin of the resort, the expenditure are measured with 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple steady reception to which only foreign diplomas are loaded in Hungary.
The receipts that are organised every year, traditionally begin with a short talk of the minister and cry out with retirement.
As the corresponding press sites report to [origo] request, there will be neither Christmas at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
The cost of the Christmas celebration was asked to notify the press department of the Ministry of Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration organised in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilize for giant strike
The Liga trade unions and the Hungarian trade union Federation form their coordination committee on Friday for the strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday a test-groß meeting will be held on Monday - on the day of the People's Assembly to the Health Insurance Act - the workout begins.
It is calculated with stress-related, significant transport disabilities as railways are almost totally adjusted, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are scattered up to 13 a.m..
Details on the strike on Monday will be given jointly by the Liga unions and the trade union Federation on Friday afternoon.
It is also established a LIGA - MOSZ Streik Committee responsible for coordination of actions on Monday.
On Saturday a test-groß meeting will be held, and from Monday all organisations connected to the strike will set down the work for unlimited time, provided that there is no agreement with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike on the day of Parliament’s agreement on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the health insurance law, the trade unions take immediately the call for a strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the Streik Committees shall come together to consult the further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even think that it is only in the later evening hours, or even at midnight, to vote on the health insurance law.
As a result of the strike starting on Monday, we will have to expect significant transport disabilities: the railwayers set their work for unlimited time, the majority of public transport resources are still still in the morning and more than half of Volán companies.
At the same time, there will be a direction for many locations.
The call for a strike has followed numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants will be updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations announced strikes at unlimited time, other plans for a temporary workout.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the free trade union of the railway VDSZZ, although more and more people are on the train around Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV from business starts up to 13 a.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy are putting the work for four hours, and the teacher work has called the democratic teacher work to 2 and 2-8 hours' strikes.
The Hungarian physician association is a country of alternate age at different times, the EDDSZ, the democratic union of workers in the health and social sector, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of the trade unions, keeps a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by Liga is that the government will resume the draft health insurance reform and a new concept of social discourse.
The second demand concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from the next year.
Call number three is the possibility of access to the early retirement system already before 2010.
The fourth point is, that the VDSZ’s VDSZ, belonging to the Liga trade unions, did not accept the offer covered by the Ministry of Transport, and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guarantee Increased State Risk
The Department for Risk Analysis (Risk Analysis Division) of Political Capital considers that the activities of the Hungarian guarantee established in this August have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects by supporting the "moving for better Hungary".
In the "Risikowarnung Report" of the Institute, the highest political risk is the "deterioration of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Cigeuner and non-cione population in Hungary, which could even lead to short-term forced ethnic conflicts".
The main reason for this is the Hungarian Guarantee strategy, which is likely to aim on the provocation of such a conflict, is the research institution.
As reported, this is considered as a failure from the political responsible sides: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of Roma question representatives of radical political groups, which have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Ungarn-Gesellschaft".
It is assumed that this would increase the problem, make the reasonable dialogue impossible, improve extremities, and the probability of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the Hungarian warrant activities had, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the home and foreign media pages, "the image of Hungary's foreign image significantly damaged, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since the autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been continuously in the elevation, so that several organizations called "national self-defense association" have been established since summer 2007.
"These groups are common that they define themselves as a civil organization, while they openly pleading to prepare their members to - sometimes armed - defense jobs (catastrophe protection, national defense, order protection), under appeal to the jurisdiction of the police, the army, or the state itself", it said.
And on the other hand, all this happens according to that method, which is trying to tarn different political efforts as a citizen's initiative, based on the population's policy and the disruption of parties.
Thus, the emphasis of civil nature and the association form do not merely serve the Umgehung of legal barriers that could occur during the registration of courts - it is a political strategy at the same time.
As the analysis is made, the Hungarian Garde activities represent a risk-advanced factor also for relations with the neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian garde has been quoted as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of their own anti-ungarn policy in the development of the Hungarian Garde.
All of this has influence on the political stability of the region.
As a result of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Garde is not a single phenomenon in Central East Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the Hungarian Guarantee activities are similar to the Bulgarian National Guarantee, whose founding was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the development of the Bulgarian Garde, the Roma mass excretions took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents equally to the occasion of establishing the National Guarantee, with the argument that the purpose of the organization of national protection is.
In the past 17 years, they believe that a regular "cigeunerterror" was felt in Bulgaria, but the state remained indispensable and indifferent - so political capital.
Moreover, the initiative would have come out of an intense debate in the Bulgarian public.
As stated, the increased risk for ethnic conflicts is also due to the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own garde for resistance.
Since the Hungarian warrant activities have so far shown many similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guarantee, it is not exclusive that the Hungarian Roma also responds to threats by organizing their own protection, the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said on request of the news agency: The risk analysis is one of the research institutes' activities.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published, and risk-changing trends should be recognized, public opinion will be informed as in the case of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are legally regulated, so that the practice of reconciliating working days around the holidays has now established, but the next year less such days are devoted to us.
Even in the EU and in America you can understand something different to "Feiertag".
The Hungarian legal system differs between government celebrations and working days.
Working days are usually religious holidays, or are related to important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working days - the last can alone rest out of the silvester feathers.
Over the whole year we have fourteen holidays.
State celebrations are the 15th March, which reminds the revolution of 1848, and 23 October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, the Government of State, on May 1st, will celebrate the work on November 1 and 2nd, we remember our dead.
In addition, there are every two holidays at Easter, Pentecosts and Christmas.
Since our national, or religious holidays are rarely falling on a weekend, the practice of "workday movement" has proved in the cases where we would work only one day before or after the celebration day.
However, the price of the extended weekends is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before or go to school.
When this day, before or after the day of celebration, will last be prepared, the Minister of Labour has been appointed in a separate Regulation for long years.
The legislation applies to all employers and workers, to public staff and officials of the public service.
Only companies and facilities where the operation is continued without interruption, including holidays.
Today, the working regulation is only brought through the holidays on the end of the year: from December 24, the life of this country remains formal, since most of the days between Christmas and Silvester take up time balance or take up self-repealed holidays.
In the next year, more holidays fall into the mid-weeks, or at the end of the week, so that there will be less discourages during working days than this year.
The calendar is first put "to the head" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, can be a peace day.
The second rediscourse depends on the holiday day on 23 October: On Saturday, 18 October you will have to finish the Friday, 24 October.
The end of the year will, however, be in the sign of holidays, after everything lies from December 24 and remains standing, even if the silvester falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrents to angry employers
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never receive - harmless lies that don't notice us anymore: they bring "colour" in everyday life on work.
The question is merely whether these small inconveniences are concerned, or are better challenge and try to avoid consciousness of other innocent situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says one colleague.
That a meeting has failed?
At best, it is regretting and trying to make it again by calling on the marketing department and reassured that you had forgotten to make the message (this is the less common method).
Most of all, this thing has been retired with an excuse.
Before breaking up in terrible speeches, you should consider what to make your colleague really uncomfortable moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Something out that doesn't belong to yourself?
There's hardly something more nervous than a document, officers, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the hedge instrument was still on the desk - today early it's gone?
Or will the lost believed ball writer be discovered at the desk of a colleague?
Without a question, nothing should be lending from the colleagues because they are rightly angry when they find that something has come away.
So, don't put a cuvert or post-it from the office into the pocket, because it could hit oneself: no more there if you need it urgently.
Does you get about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a Trac that has already been put into the world.
Who with whom, what?
Where and why?
You should not bind the information (or encouragements) on the social life of the colleagues to the nose at any time!
And if someone opens up and tells us his innerest secret, we should not misuse this trust!
The best thing is to swear like a grave, instead of setting up those who are currently present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Without reason ill reported?
If you call on in the office to report sickly on ill headache because you feel unnecessary, or just want to rest out, you should be aware of one: your own work, inevitable completions, projects with fixed dates must now be done instead of yourself.
So I don't care about the colleagues.
If you know that the next day you will not be able to make it into the office, or that there is something that could be between, because of what to stay at home, you should not report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly faced with the absence.
Total, chicken, phone calling
It is just deepened in his work, but is it suddenly disturbed by the loud scicher of the colleagues?
Is it unwanted to hear a phone talk that you shouldn't have heard?
You should not be able to seal the colleagues with sums, sings, loud conversations (who are led over their heads), getrampel, lasting smell, or reargels.
All this can be very disturbing even if they are not deepened in a task (write, plan, organize).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not done in time, you have forgotten to send a important letter or important messages, you should not seek the debt of your own forgiveness to others!
It is possible not to talk to the chaos in the office or to the loud colleagues!
The best one gets his mistakes and apologizes if others were affected!
The question of how to reimprove the error, or retreat the failure, is just all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training shose and sleep: Bequem for home, but nothing lost in the office!
Not even then, you should cloth so much if it would actually allow the job!
It should be respected to both its colleagues as well as to clothing themselves in the office - if desired, also nice and elegant!
Everyone wants to make it right - or how will you become an uninterested person for others?
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
From the radio a strange melody is coming: The sound of a violinary, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace changes, to the sounds before, the bass comes, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, who ceases on mr2.
For a long time, the heimical music scene has not just spoiled us with high-quality electropop.
But now you even see the stau differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearing of Yonderboi, some new and exciting production from the homeish digital underground scene, slowly contributes to a change in the overall image, and even if the garage dry is again "in" with its guitar grace, the heimical electropop proves: there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, musicided himself in the band of Yonderboi before he - perhaps because a host house did not carry two peppers - began to write his own way.
But the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, polluting elements from Jazz, Electronic, and Pop, he first created the request to compose the sound track to him (e.g.
"Szezon" of Ferenc Török.
The formation, which had occurred at the beginning in smaller clubs, was only known to the broader audience when the "wan2" magazine resigned its first album from 2002 under the Top 50 home albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to the nearly single trend settler, also in the western market.
There were doubts about Zagar and his band "trendy", but there was no interest if they would like to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album released with the title "Cannot Walk Fly instead" could open up new ways, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression is the time when Baláz's Zságer was still traveling with another band.
The airy, flying playback would also be okay, but next to the Etheric character of music the - the time spirit and the trend - louder guitar, the influence of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti has presented itself at the Millenáris première in England and with the band "The Puzzle".
A song from the album has even been a radioschlager - the mr2 Petřfi has been recorded with the "Wings of Love", which has been included under the participation of six silent singers ("Anderground Divas") with the ear worm.
So everything is okay (?).
The hvg.hu asked with Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How much does your music of a certain layer remain reserved?
Balázs Zságer: The term "Sight music" doesn't mean me much.
I think there are two boxes in the pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercieel and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be navigate and nonsenseous, but they can also be produced only for sale that makes it a commercial music.
A good pop number can also be created from a honest motif.
The listener's acceptance also works in line with this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: In the abroad, especially western of us, the pop music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twens on concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that pass around them much more attention because they also feel part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience come to your work?
Is it important who hears how many of your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more comes to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, music does not come to serve a purpose but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is mostly conveniable in the concerts where there is a mutual interaction, but they are only in the unattended changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one of my notices: If you all want to make it right, you're no more interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's going as a soloist and has built his career rather in the west.
B. Zs.: We don't really go on his way, but we're not going to see that you're always trying to interpret this into our music.
We see more than team players who are trusting in the musical presence of the other one.
In the beginning, our work was naturally inevitable with Yonderboi's work, as several of us came from his band and had taken another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petřfi, "Wings of Love" is the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a somewhat more popular style in the direction of a broader audience aware?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then be a train pair for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought as the final of the album that we wanted to solve the sound care and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just she, what was the guide principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to compile the choir from the soloists of the home music scene.
So the six-knowledged choir - i.e. Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikř Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized "Anderground Divas".
hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song, or have you designed the girls with it?
B. Zs.: The number has already been in the instrumental version, but when the material was finished for the album, we thought that this number still needs something.
The coordination has formally required a singing voice.
I've sung the melody in the same night, later they learned the girls.
It came all practically on Anhieb and terriblely spontaneously.
I can remember that I was quite electricity at that time, but it already needs the "disvas".
With my voice alone, the song would never become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate, as well as on the concert, they had the impression that the girls would be in the background.
There is no solo part (except the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, they sing perfectly together and are no louder than music, so their vocals are not accompanied by music only.
They also stood at the stage.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: That they have been behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we didn't want to let them come to Solo-Rolls.
The number also concerns that you should forget his ego a little, forgot who is coming and traveling, we simply allow us to make these specific wings that embrace the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the easiest song?
B. Zs.: No one in the musical creative work, there has been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, with "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert club, or with "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove didn't want to work anymore, but I still got together everything like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number of the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts and also now where I have the album "less classified".
There are currently "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Terrorist Makler risked because of minority feelings billions
Soilless fraudians
So his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French bankenriese Société Générale, owner of the comerční banka.
It came around almost five billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was only a great player who wanted to do it equally to his colleague, beyond it was certainly not incompatible.
In contrast to all large banking houses, he temporarily recognized the crisis on the American mortgage market.
"He is more psychologically weak," was heard from the mouth of his supervisors who showed him at the police.
However, as revealed by the statements of Kerviel, which published the French media, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a man who had achieved profits of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"Everything I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer he was able to earn a half billion euro at the American crisis.
The opportunity he had already spoken at the beginning of the year.
In February, there have been first news about the fact that so-called sub-principe mortgages, such as income-waaked customers or those who had previously had a disbursement problems, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not be influenced on the whole economy.
Ker much did not believe this and maintained right.
In the end, he had fired his profits up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I had deserved the first half of a billion, I didn't know how to explain this," he admits and continues that he definitely did not keep anything for himself.
During the whole hearing, he admits that he has false documents, so that he may not be cared for the worst.
He even managed to lead his heads behind the light even though the Eurex stocks gradually interested in his businesses.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to flee?
Not at all.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1,6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work his position gradually.
Société Générale entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after finishing his study at Lyon University.
His annual content was $5,000.
After two years, he was already the assistant of a Makler and in 2005 he became self-sufficient Makler with a annual content of $90,000.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never deserve as much as others.
"In my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was observing.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel said the research officer.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of Alianz, he deserved much by setting a half billion euro on course losses of this title in the London bomb attacks.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make profit, let's get you
"That's like a snowball," he said the policeman.
But the chefs supposedly knew of everything, and it meant.
"As long as I deserve money, you closed your eyes."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big hit came.
On one day he lost a billion euro.
One weekend in mid January, he wanted to compete.
When he came to work on Monday, he wasn't no longer an employer of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that she lost five billion euros for them.
And how did they come to him?
Suspect made him through a vacation.
"I took only four days from the previous year.
A Makler who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to look into the cards," said Kerviel final.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
The European Commission's Czech Ministers and Representatives signed a total of nine development programmes last year, through which the Czech Republic can come to EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion crowns).
It is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can be given from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "corporate and innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport development.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22 percent of the funds that Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have more than 90.8 billion next year.
The programme "Company and innovation" is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to gain money to innovative enterprises.
The company is intended to gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The previous EU funds Aquisition among the new candidate countries is one of the least successful among the new candidate countries.
Nicaraguans court confirms twenty-year penalty for expresentatives
On Thursday, a Nicaragua professional court confirmed the twenty-year liability penalty for former President Arnold Alemán, which he was sentenced to $100 million in 2003 because of financial fraud (near 1.8 billion crowns).
But later he was released from prison and lived under home arrest on his Hazienda at the nicararagual metropolis.
Whether the former Head of State (1997 to 2002) of this Central American State is behind the grid, according to the news agency AP is currently unclear.
According to the President of the Board of Appeal, Ileana P>>deu<<s, it will now depend on the prisoners, whether to leave Alemán's punishment at home, or whether he needs to be in prison.
Four years ago, a court confirmed that Alemán had regularly moved the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were phyctive, and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund launched by Alemán for the financing of his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is on
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government, which was adopted without support of opposition by the coalition majority.
The ČSSD (Social Democrats) was approved for the current year because the Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not allow him to refuse.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the suspicious application against the government this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The House of Parliament has noted that traditionally little but still very significant law in every tranquility.
That's paradox.
Everything begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget whether or not it likes or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is covered by the government's power struggle and opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay attention to him.
A conflict among politicians is much more interesting for the public than more nutritional figures.
State budgets have been disposed of three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which cannot eliminate the budget for the year 2008:
The first is the high share of expenditure required by law, not only for pensions but also for social expenditure which has decided the 'still-speaking' coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) in the last year before the elections.
The second is the defizit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the largest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
A true timebombe is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many Mayors have often issued untransposed credits for investment except taxes, taxes and bank loans, which they owed their banking homes.
In recent years, they managed to pay off these debts through mass sales of shares of the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the State's privateisation.
Now this source is already versiond.
As far as we only keep official and verified facts, we note that:
For a few years, as the rest of the world, our economy has passed through a growth phase, ČSSD is boastless.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to order public finances.
However, instead these governments blamed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed far more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a giantchand, which is primarily attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries which, in the global scale, are at least threatened by poverty.
That is why we do not need enormous social programmes, which have been very excessively devastated in recent years.
Even if it has been successful to strike part of the insanely populistic expenditure adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is not a shift of pension entertainment and a pension reform next time, practically any policy in this country ends, and no matter who is in power will remain as pure management.
It is only easy to overwhelm if we say that then there will be officials from dominant politicians who are going to distribute most of the tax revenue mechanically to pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution but can only be subject to the disruption of normal expenditure by obligation expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns planned for 2008 would be overridden if former governments had not issued what was just done in the past decade years.
If we do not want it to be true to become pure administrative officers from prestigious politicians, then we need to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the State can only spend as much as it is able to take taxes and fees in order to have tranquility when preparing further reform laws.
Only these allow a progressive enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to combat the crisis on financial markets together.
Thus, more than 100 billion dollars will be given auctions on the monetary markets.
On these auctions, banks shall increase interest rates to which they are ready to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed sends 40 billion dollars on auction, and another 24 makes it locker for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time after the attacks of the 11th September that the central banks of the individual States are coordinated in such a way as to prevent the defense, or reduce the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is to eliminate the greatest difficulty of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend," wrote in a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl by the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the Central Banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the USA from 65% to about 50%," added cotton in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion because of unemployed loans, especially in the United States.
Analytics expect additional billion losses.
"The central banks must have had a real fear of what can be done when decisive to this action," said ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks have the fear that if banks have difficult access to bonds, loans will become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and reduce the American economy into a recession, perhaps with impact on economic growth around the world.
The Central Banks decided to reject the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate used for the payment of money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid of lending each other money, and that although the US Central Banks, Canada and Britain had repeatedly reduced their interest rates during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another reduction of interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio by Tempus Consulting of the Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, the case of the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: The debates of ecologs are incredible
Global climate change is supposed to damage developing countries mostly.
President Václav Klaus again expressed the problem of global warming.
The criticism now addressed the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, no green planet", he said that the debates of the ecologs are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is inadequate, which represents a strange mixture of government representatives and such as non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the Rhetorik which it accompanied and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework that is only replacement for a real solution of present problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed the idea of his book that its subject is very important for him and that he is so engaged in it.
He also expressed his satisfaction about the fact that his book seemed in German translation, because "I often hit on my opinions on cardicatures."
Now, interested people could read his attitude indispensablely.
Klaus reminded that he was not a climate toologist, but he believed that he has sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He was finally academic, capable of understanding and assessing professional treatments, has experience with statistics, and is also economical.
As the main statement of the book, he called the These that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes were thus normal that there was no consistent opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the present changes were not too large and serious and thus no threat, and that the efforts to influence climate development were overflowing, effective and inadequate.
In addition, he considers it unacceptable for someone who has experience with totalitarian systems to force others unreasonable views, seeing it as a dangerous limitation of freedom.
He repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environment, but against militant eco-activists who do not take account of the relationship between effort and yield."
On the same subject, Klaus had spoken at Hayek Institute in Vienna for two months ago.
600000 people haven't managed to exchange their guide certificate
600000 drivers failed to exchange their old driver's certificate, whose validity expired at the end of the year.
Today, the last day, where you can apply to the exchange, so that the authorities can create it until the end of the year a new guide certificate.
The Ministry, however, does not fear that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers are driving on the streets without any valid right.
According to the authorities, mostly those have not exchanged their leadership certificates, who do not want to drive anymore.
While small places report a strong fall in interest in the exchange of feathers, the capital offices are overburdened with applications, and the interest in exchange of interest was still growing this week.
The city administration will complete around 2000 customers daily.
You have to stand at about half an hour.
In Prague approx. 140000 car drivers have not exchanged their guide certificate yet.
The exhibition will take 20 days.
But it is possible to apply the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns to it.
Carriers who do not create the prescribed exchange until the end of the year and run without a valid guide, threaten a penalty from January.
The ignorant pays up to 2000 crowns.
But the police can also use it with an exhortation.
In the case of a transgression, the penalty can rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the one of the congregation can also be given a penalty that does not go at all.
He could, so it said, threatening a punishment of even 30000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the offices to take Milde and to make up a sentence of 1000 crowns.
According to the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatens a dozen crown penalty.
The leader's certificate is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not he wants to have it.
It is not a personnel that everyone must have a valid person.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their guide.
It is sufficient to bring him to the responsible municipal office or to send him to it by a subscription.
Guideline certificates issued between 1964 and 1993 are invalid.
However, the drivers have to gradually exchange other types of guide certificates.
People with leaders from 1994 to 2000 have three time for exchange.
The validity of guide certificates issued by 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, about 2.6 million other guides are involved.
Judgment reduces penalties for detectives bound with Berdych
The former policemen Joseph Opava and Petr Kořařík, who are accused to have made the bands of David Berdych joint affairs, received 13 or 10 years of imprisonment.
This decided in a legal judgment by the Court of First Instance of Prague, which reduced its penalty for two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Amtes for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years.
Against today's judgment, there is no possibility of occupation, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Even though Berdych himself is accused in this matter, it is first of all the judgment.
In other processes, however, he had already received penalties from a total of 16 years.
Too much more, he can't be condemned.
In January 19, a district court spoke of the most important guilty of participation in robbery cases, the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the profession of 16 of them today.
Most of the accusers committed from the beginning to the complaint with the reasoning, it is a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police in agreement, including Berdych criminals, covered various robberys, and helped members of the bands to withdraw the prosecution.
The bands left Opava and Kořařík 30 percent of the suits for this purpose.
The complaint is about criminal acts of the bands from 1999 to 2001.
Especially for robbery, whose victims often suffer severe injuries, but also for offices and unauthorised arms owners.
At home tests, the police discovered illegal pistols, munition with steel cores, a laser target pipe and a machine pistool.
The bands claimed that their robbery has increased by many million crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this procedure, courts Berdych and a number of others recognized legally due to further robbery as guilty.
Other men from Berdych's Umkreis must be responsible in another process, further cases have not yet come before court.
The main negotiation is to have to wait for the final decision of Tomáš P\ta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish prisons and wait for the final decision on their release in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - invoice: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a disconnected hospital, the advocate of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, will require 12 million crown compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers ever three million, for the fathers ever two million and for the children ever one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent pair.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore unanimous with the proposal of Velebas.
"We reject such a proposal, he is to be too much high," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"In order to give us a view to this counter proposal, we need the advice that made the counterparty.
We will find out whether it is worth saying at all.
However, we believe that this should be for all together in the hundreds of thousands," said Dostál.
The amount should be moved between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jablokov wanted to get a million crown for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, as a basis for compensation negotiations, a advice worked for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children feel that specialists in the field of psychology and psychiatric damage and stress symptoms have suffered in different strengths and depths.
The men tended the stress situation better, even if they saw anxiety against them that they could have prevented the change of the newborn.
The women again come with the implications of the experienced dreamas worse, as well as with what is currently running together with Veleba.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses on 9 December last year in Tadhramebíč.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablořov.
The Vysočina District Chief (Böhmish-Messian height) transmitted at the end of October every family 100000 crowns as a replacement for expenditure created by the error of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are assured by law for liability.
In the event of doubt, they must take a reserve fund only if they can apply to aid in the carrier.
The courts have already agreed to compare low amounts of damage, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polívka came around his Kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight around the brand "Königreich Walachei".
The judge at the district court in Ostrava, although he first used the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actress.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiation today.
His lawyer, however, has probably not finished this thing, and his client will probably make a profession.
"The dispute concerns that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas," said Polívkas lawyer after negotiation.
All were presenting these actors and committees in the words "Walachic Kingdom".
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have a almost ten-year work behind us.
Money creation and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is fighting for money.
"After years, they noticed that the project is successful and that they could have something about it.
They want to win parasitary at our work," he continued.
Lukrative Business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian king" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, he was acclaimed by Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that did not go together with the intention of reasoning a diligent Kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš came to know how to spend walachic passages.
A business and entrepreneur's activity, which Harabiš then joined the establishment of the company "Walachic Kingdom".
In 1997 Polívka agreed to use his name and its signature in the Passages and even offered its owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre shows.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also argued that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" mission for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has surely helped the project of the Walachian Kingdom," said the judge.
But she added that the soul of the Harabiš project was and his team who had been intensely dedicated to him.
The collaboration of the parties today took place until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official crowning for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, between Polívka and Harabiš started hiding the disputes that were chosen in the deposit "König Boleslavs I. selected until the Sankt-Nimmerlein Day".
The role of the leadership was then used to suggest Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a king's mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka entrusted Harabiš and his company invoked the complaint today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
That should be a new king.
Details and a date he didn't want to betray yet.
"We don't want to surgery.
It should be something like the king's move in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Polívka also can calmly sign up," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: Expire advantages
To tell the truth I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not much worth, the quality of walking, steering and processing could be referred to as increasingly under average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it's a lot better.
The combi with the name SW is still a bit further, and I am just going to redirect my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the too low head freedom on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer available because the caros series of the combi is designed so that not even two meters will suffer.
Quickly Continue
I'm just going through the interior so I can't repeat too much.
It is a very successful design where I have stimulating only because of the placing medium tunnel.
There I would welcome some more designal design, where the car else makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable and pass the times where we may be damaged over too short seats or head supports.
The side content has also significantly improved compared to the 206.
As far as the space offer is concerned, you can also feel the increased dimensions of the carrosserie here.
In the combi, the lack of head freedom has also been removed.
Case in the case room
However, the main issue at this car is the charging room.
I have to call him (also because of the relapsable rear window) very well beladable and place-saving.
The honey rooms are equipped with holders that represent an ideal compromise.
They don't disturb, can be pulled out and hold harder objects.
But we're talking about the charge volume.
It is according to table in basic equipment 428 litres, which is a more average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most commonly sold vehicle in Czech Republic of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot rears to significantly sensitive 52 litres.
This value is already critical for an external leave or when a child car is invited.
But in order to highlight the position, I still need to mention the very flat charging space after the rear seats, or also the very low charge edge.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder benzine motor with helicopter 1,6 litres and a performance of 88 kWp.
And honestly, it should look like a 1600 cubic engine that attracts a family hatchback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption and gets well away.
If I compare him with his counterpart to Škoda, which sometimes works, as if his exhaust would be hiding with a lap, then I can only be excited by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just national.
But we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious inside and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine at the height of 329900 crones is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment premium of the test car will be added to booking with 80000 krones.
However, we had headair bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc-of-the-art solution, electric window lifters back and...
Thus the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but you will even expect the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision that you want to choose remains.
Integration of Slovak students at British schools is not able
At British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, which is the local fears of further development of the local school system.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has a number of obstacles.
British schools even determine cases where disputes between the immigrants and the children of the original residents take over violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants gradually increase.
Differences, canyes and pupils have been transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had hit a ten - year - old boy with an ice stange.
The accused defended that the boy had insulted her with racist implications.
After a attack of two minor girls, the police also had to take action on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had supposedly made racist comments to the man and cast him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a busho and spucked on us.
When I told him that he was supposed to stop, he throwed us with apples and pears and then uncovered his vessel," described a mother of Slovak students of the newspaper The Times another uncommon incident.
complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even called the fight with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival campaign.
The cases mentioned testify that the stimulation between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more and more stressful.
In Britain 70000 Slovakians who came to work are reported here.
Approximately 30000 Slovak students are visiting British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of Caribbean
For visitors it is really a island of freedom.
Whatever you expect of your holiday, this will be fulfilled if you only select the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea, which is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Included with cellars offering pizza, ice and delicate cocktails at the beach.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in an extensive measure.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniard, Cuba was its base for the conquerion of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that has ever seen a human eye.
Havanna was once a camp or passage camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American epoch came.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
Building made it one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was in the U.S. as crimes (in particular during the prohibition), was pleased to be seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, high houses grown over the wide boulevards driven cars, which were among the cult symbols of the fifty years of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havanas, and in Cojímar he had lie down his yacht.
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the showbusiness and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna you can also leave your car gramme.
At the bar in the hotel Nacional you mix for you cocktails for your wish.
And the cult cars of the fifty driven in Havanna until today, because the once imported shuglilis and fiats have long fallen out of each other in the salty and moist air.
May Havanna, especially its oldest part, have come down strongly, nowhere can be found as many wonderful colonial sights as you are here.
Other places are just exhausted, for example Trinidad.
With a view to making tourism urgently necessary money, there was green light for this development.
In the past fifteen years, not only new hotels have been created in Havanna, but also in Vardero, on the coast of the Province of Holguín and also on islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuva offers another martyr on the world and attracts especially railway lovers.
The sugar tube of distant plant days brought damp and the same driven swim tracks to the sugar manufacturers.
Her Fuhrpark has not been renewed over decades, and so you can see some funny and working locomotives, whose agemates are long in the museum.
Flight targets
The most important places do not allow the majority of the visitors of Cuba.
So you don't have to write more detailed about Vadero or Havanna.
Only to mention that in the presence of Hemingways, there is a museum, whose visit should not be disclosed by the writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba.
The exciting vegetation grows on cake floor.
The Mogotas, cake pillows and rocks, scattered from the valley floor, gathered in their honey rooms, through which the rock areas of dense wounds are also covered.
This valley is where the best Cuban tobacco is built.
In its final form you can meet on him when you visit one of the Havanna cigarettes.
Some may also appear interesting that there was the Chinese consequence of the television series "Major Zeman".
Trinidad
A ancient city, which was founded shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
Ruhm and wealth brought her trade with slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French colonials, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray river, is such a remote place that there was no road left with the other country in the fifty years of the last century.
This isolation helped to keep it unreasonable.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the "Tal of Sugar Factorys".
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which is looking after the darkness, and where music does not swear until the morning.
Baracoa
This town quite in the east of Cuba is known as the most beautiful of the island.
This view will certainly be influenced by the way there.
Both streets leading by Guantánamo there must overcome high and crushed mountains and walk through a landscape that has hardly touched by human interventions.
These east preposts Cubans recorded the UNESCO thanks to the uncomfortable nature in their World Heritage Directory.
There the best chocolate is produced in the church you show the cross of Columbus (in reality it is created about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present hotel El Castillo, is to see several tablet mountains of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigarans, the Sierra Maestra river, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban Patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the seeds of slaves can write about all that.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Associations in Afghanistan are passive, claiming Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States as a result of the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should, according to the words of the Defense Minister Robert Gates, delegate a concrete plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not act according to its ideas, over it were the representatives of the countries in Scotland who had stationed in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the bonds.
While the United States, by its defence minister Robert Gates, raises the NATO-Entities to more activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the Afghan government's authority and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan a pre-development can be felt, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the residents to begin a further development of the economy and security," says the British Des Browne of BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebellions has reached the highest level for five years, according to information from the American Army.
In comparison to the previous year, the number of violence measures has increased by 27 percent in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed some 400,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, the bonds have been put into a absolute limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
They specifically demand further helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today, the Secretary-General of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop.
"I am not excited about what we have available in Afghanistan to lands and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we needed, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters Agency for the end of three days with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, the countries involved are also contradicting whether all people in Afghanistan are best.
Because of passivity, Germany was criticized, for example.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
However, they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" described the German soldiers this week as a faul.
"Afghanic nonsature distargets: The Germans are making games while our boys fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a contribution complemented by photos of German soldiers to play the table tennis.
The German image newspaper went over to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a Rugby-containment campaign in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debts will be reduced to a billion in 2009
On each of the Czechs a national guilt of 84,000 crowns is dismissed.
The total debt increased by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to blame this year with 159.2 billion cone.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of the State budget policy.
The national debts of the Czech Republic increased by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June, they sank around 13,4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its information on state debts from the beginning of October.
On each of the Czechs a debt of 84,000 crowns is dismissed.
Over the past year, the State has been guilty of more than 111 billion crowns.
"But now it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we may exceed the limit of a billion crown until 2009.
Next year the debts should move between 900 billion and a billion crown," said David Marek, analytic of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analytics of the Next Finance: "To overrun a Billion we could come through 2009.
When exactly, the next budget is dependent on which we don't know yet.
If it should be shown that the situation on the political stage should change, and the politicians should be ready to save more, this could take place until 2010.
But I don't leave from such a change," he noticed.
Growing debts
State debt rises from the debts of government governments and is mainly from the rise of deficits in the state budget.
State debt is financed by estimate instructions, government debts, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic government debt increased this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debts of the state increased by 1.7 billion krones to 123.3 billion now.
At the end of September, the so-called market-like government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns and decreased by 13.7 billion since June.
The average failure of state debts increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased over the year from the first to the third quarter by 13 percent, which is really much in view of how good the economy is.
Interestingly, growth is particularly due to debt incurred, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debts rise, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform is coming," said Pikora.
Better than expected
In 2007, the government had planned to record 159.2 billion crowns from the financing strategy and to associate government debts.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the better development of the State budget policy.
This amount is mainly based on the State budget deficit, which is evidently 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum budget for the consolidation agency of 13,3 billion crowns, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government debts for 43 billion and the rates for loans at the European Investment Bank at 1.8 billion.
For her name of a Teddybear, she was presented a court in Jarom today.
According to their lawyer, the British teacher who had been accused in Sudan for the destruction of Islam was condemned on Thursday evening by a court in Khartum to 15 days of imprisonment and subsequent instruction.
The British was accused to have allowed six-up to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She'd deserve to be pedaled out.
After parents of schools had been complained several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old basic school teacher who was active at the Unity High School of Khartum was attacked at home on Sunday and accused in accordance with Article 125 of the sudanese penalty book of the deception of Islam.
In fact, this issue takes its beginning in September when the teacher invites her six- to seven-year-old students to seek a name for the classifieddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as the best first name.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a prename in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself had no sign with this name, but the problem is very simple that the rendering of the Islamic prophet is regarded as a deception of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who informed at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew them well, and she had never done anything that could near them a religious faith, I am only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, because of this it is just an innocent error.
A view that shares many students of the teacher who are very obvious to their students and as a person who never describes about religion in class.
It is note that the first name Mohammed is at the same time the second name given in Britain, for which there are 14 different letters in English.
This often selected by moslemic families is considered to be a kind of honor to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how do the rules relating to the use of this first name say?
For example, may you give him a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday there was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last meeting in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
The Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and last discussion session in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status, said the European Consumer Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With emphasis on the progress of peace in the region, Frank Wilsner Belgrad and Pristina called on his American counterpart to comply with their obligations to maintain peace and to continue discussions beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and showed that there are quite clear tensions.
End of communications on 10 December
The transmitters of the Troika, which combine the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be a last meeting in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province in Albanian speakers could be more clear when Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian median Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council until December 10.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, the sixth and last negotiation session since the Troika last August, the UN had received the order for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect to end their mediation contract on 10 December.
The Russians, which had already blocked the consent of the independence of Kosovo at the Security Council, are beyond this end date on continuing negotiations.
Russia was and remains a speaker of a negotiated solution, a unique solution, said Botsan-Khartchenko.
One-sided independence Declaration?
After the Kosovo has been under the UNO’s administration for eight years, the Western countries are considering independence under supervision by the EU for the only solution with the future.
Pristina is ready to preach this one-sided if the Security Council should not decide for its favours.
Belgrade consists of increased autonomy
Unfortunately , no agreement could be reached , the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden since Monday the last opportunity was held.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Cosovarian Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his regret.
He added, however , that the plan proposed by Belgrade on the autonomy of a past led to murders and deportations .
Domino Effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic believed that a compromise was always pursuing and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo before the consequences of a single independent declaration of the province.
Belgrad believes that it is particularly a "Domino effect" in a region that has been weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation stated that any decision would be made only in the Security Council alone, where its Russian bondant has a veto law.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the Council of Security is acceptable for Serbia, said the Serbian Prime Minister of Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
The journalists replied to Fatmir Sejdiu that the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on status and added that each one-sided independence declaration of the sides of the Albanian population will be absent in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush exhorts a agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
In opening the international peace conference, which had gathered under his direction in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive regulation of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he will do everything to help them close a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians have to destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must set up its colonization work, Bush explained and reminded the two parties of their obligations with regard to the peace plan that had agreed in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas finally seek a peace agreement to clarify all open questions without exception and including central questions .
This label includes the three serious problems which are mostly rotated by the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future limits of Palestinians, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who have been distributed from their homeland, in the context of the conflict of 1948, which is located in the state of Israel today.
After the U.S. President, Abbas took the word and claimed that the next negotiations will be carried comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the limits, the colonies, water and security.
On the other hand, Olmert took the word, he was obliged to ensure that the coming arms' suspension negotiations are conducted directly and without interruption and that he will strive to be completed before the end of 2008.
Bush has adopted the time limit for the implementation of its vision of two States , a Palestinian and an Israeli party consisting of each other for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has received a assurance in this sense by Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken by all Arab countries into the ways that Israel provides peace in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arab areas occupied during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a divorce in the history of the Middle Orient, especially because it attacks on the roots of the conflict and on its central facepoints, saudi Arab prince believes in his interview with the Arab language newspaper financed by Saudi.
The lawyer considers that the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and gentles face themselves.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the National Disciplinary Authority of the police (IGPN), a police car on the Rue Louise-Michel direction of Villiers-le-Bel went on Sunday.
He had no use, but was on stroke, and went with 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a speaker of the police.
A green motorcycle of Kawasaki brand, without authorisation, has not been released for public road transport (see below), was driven by two young people without helmet, with very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had missed its frontier from right, a police officer continued.
The alcoholic control carried out in the vehicle passengers was very negative.
The state of the car (sulted cotflügel, splittered wind protection disc, clots) proves to be of the intensity of the excitement.
Very fast, already yesterday morning, the lawyer of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Térèse de Givry announced that she has entrusted the IGPN about the "facts of non-free person killing and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in agreement with the main district guide for public security of Val-d`Oise.
On the afternoon, at a press conference, the lawyer stated that she excludes the IGPN in this stadium the responsibility of the police.
According to the Magistratin, three Witnesses of the accident, which were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small power wheel has been relatively quickly arrived on their left side .
Yesterday, a kind of rills, surely caused by the friction of the footrasts on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were hurried together until the police created it to breach.
The vehicles were taken and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The body name of the two victims was obdued yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a smell made the round, according to the police had left the accident site very quickly, and that without providing help to the two youths.
Although the IGPN remains quite careful, this would also exclude any serious error.
According to a political source , this is a difficult aspect of the investigations needed for further investigations and which must be very careful .
Libération has made an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had direct views of the scene.
We went out immediately with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to live her again, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a totally distorted policeman who was hanging down.
Two others tried to releven one of the youths, the fourth phoned.
In view of the stress that was rapidly trained for events, and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the young people were concerned about the unreasoned situation of young people, the police were taken in the car at the place of accident.
According to this testimony, the rescue forces met about 20 minutes after the road of the police.
They have also used heart massages, but forgiving.
I won't allow that the police forces would not have helped the young people.
These young people have been first assisted.
The fire fire has come right now.
All things were done to try to save them, stressed the lawyer on the other hand.
In Pakistan the tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistan police has defeated the first demonstrations since two days before the emergency was called by General Musharraf.
According to witness statements in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, some 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated the measures taken against the emergency, were injured by the tear gas granates that used the order forces there.
He was warning with stones with which they hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured.
Several would be arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstration as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositional, defenders of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.

More than one third of pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the badly planned or unprecedented births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Newwirth Act, which allowed the precautions in France, one of three pregnancys (36%) is not planned as a study of the National Institute for Demographical Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the badly planned or unprecedented births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contamination such as the pills or the spiral still show a fault rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill useers between 20 and 40 years of use of pills has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, liberalisation of receiver prevention has still enabled a better control of fertility.
In any case, eight of ten births were carefully planned today.
For one of five couples even on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the yeartime in which it seems most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and its cameras from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will need more than seven hours in the space to perform the spectacular repair of a broken sun collector, which is indispensable for continuing scientific work at the station.
A waiting exit that has reached several records by the Astronaut tools to perform the repair, due to its duration, the distance of living modules, the speed he was organized.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when astronauts had downloaded the module Harmony from space ferry Discovery, a large cylinder-shaped part that should soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laser.
But you need to be able to provide it with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5 tonnes of heavy module for electricity production over solar collectors already on the ISS in order to bring it to its final position.
After she had moved it, the crew made up to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose range is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which like accordones, was damaged by a clothed cable on a length of about one meters
The restructuring was stopped to no longer damage the collector.
The astronauts who were originally leaving the space ferry Discovery and then had to repair another solar collector, whose rotation system was wrong, saw forced to wipe the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30 meters long-lasted arms of the space ferry that were placed at the station to perform the repair.
It is one of NASA's best space walters.
Large, resistant, very sent, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old taught doctor was selected to operate the injured sun collector .
After assessing the damages, he separated the wrong cable and strengthened a kind of rails on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second space walter, who stayed near the lock, and, from there, by the other astronauts, among them, Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used to avoid an electric hit, the astronaut on board of the station had been thought and jacked .
When the action was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully enclosed before he picked his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to space ferry Discovery to come back to the earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS at the stock exchange sanctioned
After the Aviation and Defence Group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counteract the A400M residues, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline in the Paris stock exchange.
Currently, EADS will lose 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris stock exchange.
The group was forced to review its business prognoses for 2007 again with reference to the residues caused by the only slowly advanced development of the A400M engine that delayed the virgin flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in delivering their military transport aircraft are between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion, more than one billion for Airbus, the mother companies of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be obliged to present new operating objectives (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results in the next Thursday.
The Group also notes that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month residue.
To remember that the EADS business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006, significantly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
Originally, the group had provided a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of the Quo status
On Sunday it will not be exciting when the Urns tells them: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's Party, United Russia.
After a very distorted election campaign, she confirms its pursuit of stability, even according to authoritarianism.
Three days before Parliament elections, the Russian President Wladimir Putin addresses a message to the public missionaries, which have already been recorded, but whose contents are kept secret.
He does this in his property as a designer of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not let it look through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was satisfied to provide a new attack point against the West powers accused of his favourite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of truly democracy and hope that we will be honest elections, extremely transparent and openly, elections without fraud, he added.
From the view of opposition they left.
It prefers a conspiracy of suppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of demonstrations last weekend, the ex-such world champion Garry Kasparovder has been sentenced to unauthorised demonstrations to five days of imprisonment according to his lawyer continues visiting ban.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Soviet
Following these parliamentary elections without stress, two many further questions arise:
Who will join Putin's success as President?
The term of office has announced yesterday the date of the first election of the Presidency elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have the time to make known by 23 December.
Since he was chosen in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Wladimir Putin cannot come into effect for a third mandate.
And now there's no follower.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of Parliament's majority and the Almighty Party of the United Russia, the Government and President will choose?
Whatever it will be, in Parliament's or the Presidency elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not lord of their fate, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of Sankt Petersburg continues even further: the bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has reconnected to the model of a paternalist state, which was perfectly accepted by the population, as the new Paternalism did not follow terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman says of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians from free pieces rely on the personal responsibility that they have shortly put on the day after the suspension of the USSR.
What's going on for a long time?
This phenomenon concerns all the history of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands maintaining the status of Quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian provincial chairs) lead to the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new, from the West coming freedoms are often equal to Chaos, as in the 1990s.
The generality prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not also vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What about long?
Those who are in power are not so bad why they dissolve?
A hard thinking
After they have been treated confidentially over 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which were produced at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now unless it was humanitarian intention, individually and named, so on request of an former victim or his family.
The 11 States responsible for their administration including Germany, France, Israel and the United States have agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians in May 2006.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Hooky Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research, especially about the deportations of prisoners, the insassen of the concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Meistern, head of this archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were still to make available to the public due to certain information on behalf of the public.
For example, the supposed homosexuality or spiritual disability of some deportation sacrifices.
The inmate lists of concentration camps or the liability commands issued by the Gestapo were compiled for a practical reason after the war: civilians who were deported or forced to find them, and may provide them a evidence of their arrest in order to evacuate them the way to their compensation.
Today, more than 300 fixed tens of thousands of personal requests are still editing in Bad Arolsen.
However, part of the scientific community shows only limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
No basic news in these documents should be expected, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Centre for Antisemitism of the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to gain a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, the mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches the 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is the most important trading partner in India and is 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs had given the European Commission last April green light to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian nations (Asean), with a view to signing mutual trade between India and Europe already reaching 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and is 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade Pact will increase the two economic rooms enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million beneficiary Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products exported from India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European Guitars exchanged goods every year at the value of 47 billion euros and services at the value of 10 billion euros, had explained this week Danile Smadja, President of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, and regret that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India will meet their eight diplomatic in New Delhi, the Prime Minister of Manmohan Singh, and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of disturbance and provides 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England showed concerns about reducing the current restoration of credit conditions and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an unusual offer.
In order to weaken the fears that the conditions of the financial market will be particularly difficult at the end of the year and to give the banks a greater certainty about the way in which they are intended to organize their liquidity positions in this period, the Bank has the intention of providing a significant part of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase starting on 6 December , in the form of an open marketing operation for five weeks , provided it in a communication.
The Bank continues to explain that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) are surrounded on 6 December by 12th GMT, as a basic tax rate and only by 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE brings into five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is willing to take further measures in order to receive the different rates of interest rates of inter-banked Leisures with their basic interest rates from day to day.
The intermediate interest rate varied from day to day on Wednesday at 5.829%.
The rate of three months has been 6,6%, something higher since September 18th.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums brought by the Bank of England have been linked to criminal fees that the banks had kept to use them.
According to certain suffices, strengthened by the development of the pound course in contrast to euro, many preferred to sign the sums brought by the European Central Bank to more favourable interest rates and with safe discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to verify the PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday the groups of UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist Law Template on Purchasing Power, which is similar to a refusal of the text.
The text established in the context of a Socialist niche (session on an initiative of a parliamentary grouping) indicates about ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, of which the majority of 50% for employment allowances, for the re-importation of the TIPP, for a transport check or for the restriction of rentals.
UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion that offered to partially severe change of word between majority and opposition occasion, some hours before the TV contribution by Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchase force.
The leader of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the totality of its proposals as a amendment to the legal plan for correcting the financial sector, which had been examined last week by the Assamblee.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumours regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announced the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in cooperation with the British producer Melvin Benn festival.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, not more and less, served as a example for the current festival movement in America, shared Jones from C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 organizes the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campsite holiday.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August on a 500 acre of large private farms about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The leader of the Festival Republic of Melvin Benn, previously known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned festivals.
In 1989, he took over the lead of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts the 80 000 people every year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been involved in the production of the licensing concerts and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now take up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, the Glastonbury describes as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been involved, says that his company and Melvin Benn work parallelly together to provide a festival event in European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are actively working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, Charlie Jones says.
We led negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we stayed in Polit Debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly, we could discuss with Melvin Benn and meet preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will finally benefit from the population."
C3 Presents again raised the Lollapalooza Festival in the Grand Park Chicago in 2005 after it was profiled together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of festival in 2002.
The two events have been able to reach 9.8 million dollars in 2007 and 11.8 million dollars on gross tax restaurants.
These two festivals are held in urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while the ignorants take place rather on urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The same is, in some way, to melt these two concepts together, in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and a city in the US's way."
Vineland is located about half between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the last of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
Lastly said, it refuses to present the conditions of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and take up a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is very large, in about the 80.000 people at Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vienneland will offer tasteful rock, but music will be very varied in the hope of attracting all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal's on the appointment.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no minor than the Terminator is thereby.
These lock attempts include delegated tasks.
A political "heikles mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who represents Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "gouvernator"?
"You must be careful because it's the industry that decides where she goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are beneficial, they will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think the best," he says.
The run on the festivals.
For Denis Turcott, however, at the moment the presentation of the cinema has the highest priority.
The hunting for the Oscars began.
On all festivals on the west coast, although the films from Sundance, the one from Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be going to present Quebec's films to evaluate them and ensure that the producers are interviewing.
The dark age had a successful idea at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the postal in Santa Monica and is presented on the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange ahead of an end-year-Rally? Unanimity with experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With nearly five weeks until the annual end of the stock exchange, the investors are already borrowing their hands with a view to the coming end-year rally.
However, the experts cannot create a safe forecast on this matter.
Banif believes that only statistically considers that the month of December goes in the stock exchange normally with a positive market development
It is unfortunate to create prognoses for short-term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not if serious tensions determine the current market event
Although other experts do not approve such a strong rate increase in the last weeks of the year, they still note that the stock rate will be determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, which invests mainly in pension funds due to the lack of certain shares, which is significantly affected by the trend in the risen trend.
As a result, these experts believe that the stock exchange will rather be able to reflect a more lateral, market trend, especially because we cannot estimate the extents of the possible decline in the rate of interest in the US note bank, an uncertainty which is primarily due to the increased raw oil price and the risk of the increase in the rate of inflation.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the Sales Department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a waiting time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The opportunities are not very good, the expert assured.
The Spanish share index Ibex has lost a value of 4 % since its highest mark on 8 November, from 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, Analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could, because of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional, each year's grant of pensions made every year, end the year with nearly 6,000 points.
Nevertheless, the expert highlighted that this year things could develop different things, especially because of the end-year-Rally taken place in the second December week, and then directly after the bridge day on the Constitutional Day.
The Analysis believes that price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, Analyst at the Bank Inversis, the previous assessments are at a nearly technical level, which could result in a deviation of index values which are whose dimensions are depending on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analysis trusts that these are positive.
In selecting the values to advance the Ibex to new maximum sizes, the analysers agree.
Solana by Intermoney stresses that this year are the great values at the line.
As the electricity sector will be expensive at the given time, the expert would include the two large banks and some real estate companies.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha from the Bank Inversis assures that the increases in connection with the bank and industrial sector will go.
If the Rally actually occurs, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months, ACP was at the pick-up course and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same way, says the expert.
As regards the increased consumer behaviour during Christmas days, market events will be determined in the last half of the periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results even if they are represented only in lower numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only in two cases, the December has been awarded courses.
At the end of 2003, the technology bubble took place, this led the stock exchange from its crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real end-year era.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 collected by 28.17 percentage points, the December increased a rate of 6.68%.
Whether in 2008 the fifth profiting year will be followed (Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and a final year will show itself.
Popularly, his 200 credit institutions will have opened from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of his branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute operated under the brand name Popular Max, these establishments mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, since popularity as the first banking group is expected to extend the opening times of his branches weekly until 20 p.m. and to apply Saturdays from 10h to 20h.
The BBVA banking group, which also reads the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet adopted a final decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions appear to be aimed at a agreement that will close 75% of all branches on Saturdays and open them on one week afternoon, although not for the public.
Whether other banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening times will depend on the experiences of the popular bank.
And that is also the intention of pursued popularity with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening times of the branches, which can cover the purchasing community of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those covered by large purchase houses.
The Bank wants to open up the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, since it is not new but changed opening times.
To this end, the Bank will transform the spaces of the establishments already in business zones and simultaneously compare them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening times is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more modern, colourful design.
The competent banking representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require greater investment, but with an increased personnel, as a branch was no longer six, but eight or nine employees needed.
The establishments that will even be equipped with additional spaces for SMEs will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets of Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seemed to have been a wise decision.
Popular is currently directing about 2500 branches.
And more than 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized on immigrants and also show extended opening times, even on sun and holidays.
In these branches of popularMax, the model of BBVA will not be used, since most of them will offer a wide selection of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers , says Rivero.
With telephoneica they have provisionally agreed to sell by means of external bank personnel mobiles.
The Spanish Private Sender Telecinco doubles his stock value for the first time and thus overhealt his rival Antena 3.
We've done it.
With this sentence, the Managing Director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the meeting. The sender led by him had increased his value to the twice of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, fought his joy: that's exactly what is hurt me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had less losses, he found.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they are not too deeply reduced.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a Plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous this year's loss to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value is now reaching 4.488.88 million euros, while media set controls the main share of capital (52%) and Vocento is only involved in 13%.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so that its market value amounts to half half by 2.193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other stock-notified communication companies rises to 2.518.53 million in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million in Prisa (the publisher of the Cinco Días magazine) to 1.779 million in the case of Vocento.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deducted from the fact that it is two similar companies, says Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question still appears in what extent we can actually act up-to-dately, at what price and how we can make it successful at customer level.
Telecinco explained his project a week ago to rise to the first television channel with more than 1000 million gross winnings from advertising revenue. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, the Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising requirements compared to 965.4 million from the previous year by 3.6%.
In the case of Antena 3, the net sales rate increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net inclinations from television business could only increase 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco's better stock exchanges will see the analytics at the high payout ratio that the company could show up to the present time: in 2006, the company led a 100-procent dividend extraction of the company conducted by__BAR____BAR_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Vasile, however, assures that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of endmol, with mediaset as a parent company, the rate could still vary, even if it is too early for an official notice.
We are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have ever stated significantly more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we could already increase by buying 33% of the end-million shares.
According to the analytics, the market is currently showing certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% and 2009 from 5.5% to 5.1%.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: sets on its high efficiency and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Does Telecinco (purchasing) miss due to the multiple incentives and the prospering market a more favourable position in antena 3 (hold).
3.
JPMorgan: Recommends the expectations of the similar threats (saturated market and poorer economic climate) in both cases
The Congress agrees to the MIFID Directive which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with Parliamentary drafting, which today completed its meeting with the Congress Decision in the Senate on the supplementary/change applications associated with the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both the rules until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congress and Senats, who had pursued the objective in their negotiations and votes to set up the best possible arrangements to ensure the security of the investors and regulate the individual entrepreneurs' activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market agreement.
The MIFID, which sets out the Securities Service Regulation, also pursues the modernisation of financial markets, the improvement of investor protection, the increase of control claims from the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables both specialised companies and natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), to consulting companies which are interfering with the investment and mediation companies of securities.
In addition, it expands the number of financial transaction systems, so that the regulated conversion markets are added to the multilateral systems of the operation and the systems for internationalisation of trade contracts, which would eventually come into competition with the current economic actors.
The law complies with investment companies, the focuses of their company profile, the confrontation and the forms of conducting risks on the market and the registration of all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Economic Commission of the Congress saw further amendments, with the decision that the debt incurred by title must now apply to the investor as a complex financial instrument, confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and bank crisis. (US hypothecrisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the labour sectors of diplomated economic scientists was adopted; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation, which restricted the work areas reserved for the economic scientists, was adopted.
On the other hand, the Senate sets up new positions in the financial sector, such as the CNMV’s economic medicine, which works on foreign account does not require authorization and offers its services for the commercialisation of products and the customer achievement at the same time several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) has increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator that Eurostat serves for the assessment of the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price development taken in Spain in November.
Its publication corresponds to the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare local and quality data to US products by communicating data.
The indicator forecast can be created prematurely by applying the same approach as in the harmonised consumer price index but at the same time use various other statistical modelling methods to assess the information that is not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) stated that the indicator prematurely identified should only serve as a correct value, and therefore do not agree with the final result announced on the next 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of State and Ministers of Economic and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in VPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time, it assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, Solbes found in the halls of the Congress Building that even if the current number is not good , Spain's inflation difference was more or less equal to the other members of the monetary union in recent years.
He also explained that there were less surprises in November than in the previous month, where the government did not count to such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, and the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance announced the forecast today.
Virgin is calculated with Northern Rock revenues of more than 42 billion euros in the next three years
North Rock’s value stocks have fallen by more than half after the bank had crowned the British Notenbank in mid-September last year for an emergency credit, and they now only amount to 12,000 million pounds (the amounts to 16,800 million euros).
At that time, the Bank’s assets were reduced by 25,000 million pounds, a sum that was significantly reduced within two and a half months by the loss of trust of customers and even despite the hundred percent guarantee of the government that the money will continue to be safe until the crisis ends.
The Virgin firm, who would continue to continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, must bring about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks, which will be composed from the installations of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their targets of 30 billion.
The multimillionary group Richard Branson, known by its suspicious advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to flow 50,000 million pounds per year in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, who is still participating in three other companies, as his preferred beekeeper to lead it out of insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana arrested due to irradiative suspicion of participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police has arrested today morning the current mayor of the town's Murcia village of Totano (Partido Popular), due to the urgent suspicion of development in urban corruption that was detected this week.
One of the secretaries of the Council and the Chief of the municipal police was also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo, the office of Juan Morales, currently members of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the Municipal Council of Totana, and may be the original tractor of the competitor after information from the newspaper Cadena SER.
The officials continue to search out the business documents of the community and the Ministry of City Planning and do not exclude any further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the main suspect at the beginning of this week, the case of urban corruption discovered.
According to information from the Cadena SER , the lawyer of the popular , and consequently privileged Members Juan Morales have taken hold of his client's residence due to important burdenful documents that should be related to the competitor.
In addition, other sources of information from the quantitative order payments of morals to a Galician construction company which observed the conclusion of a urban construction contract in which the construction of a 200 hectare area was decided.
At present, eight persons are in investigation.
Bono agrees to accept the participants of the PSOE in Toledo and, in case of a election victorion, at the convention.
The former Defense Minister José Bono adopted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and, accordingly, he will adopt the list of the PSOE Candidates in the coming General Elections in Toledo and, in the case of a election of the Socialists, take over the Office of the Congress President.
So José Blanco, organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced at the press conference, after today the party's head office took place a meeting with Zapatero.
The Head of State believes that the offer is justified to the former minister, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the case of a victory for the socialists in the coming elections, the politicians from Mancha would be able to be chaired by the party for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, which had announced last 15 November to no longer enter into the next general elections, to finish his career in public policy and to use itself in the university area for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his return, the President of the government had continued to return to political events for two years ago.
In addition , he pointed out that the party, as the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, would not pretend the citizens who would take over the posts of the Congress President, would be a act of transparency .
In fact, if he should take the office, he hopes that the chamber should transform into a house of respect and not to breach or cry, in order to let them appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, one gets the impression as if the only place in which Madrid cannot speak quietly and leaves is the convention; the President of the government was interrupted up to 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Martín and his good work and said that he did not want to resurrect the office already, since, otherwise, his political counterparts would call this as arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since climate debates both the creators of climate change as well as those who put a social and political debate on this matter under an uncomfortable criticism, the movement must be given a strong cohesion as a whole.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement, who, as the President of the Government Zapatero, thinks that the fight against climate change is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to close a new agreement with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in the note of action, or non-treatment of its government, which has made it vital to help Spain stand at the top of the countries in the EU who have met the Kioto protocol's requirements at least.
Those are responsible for the non-compliance of the standards on which sectors are due to this, and why its government, which had proposed the Treaty with the planet, did not stop this development.
He is now forced to present the Spanish citizens measures against climate change without reciprocity.
What companies will be affected by the change of the behaviour of citizens, which individual and collective saving measures must be carried out and which economic consequences will result from it.
In fact, who has to offer himself and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and there will be no such statements in the future.
Just because it is about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be realised against climate change are inhabited.
They are costly, uncommon and threatened for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the benzine centre proposed by the PSOE appeared by Zapatero electurally so dangerous that he saw himself forced to re-establish the proposal.
Therefore it is now true to save the planet with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty Proverbs without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its agreements with the planet, the other political politicians must not speak, nor claim, nor demand, but do not comply with the challenging edition, smuggling the meetings and enthusiasm with his mildness and kindness.
This can only happen if the contract does not deviate purely virtually and therefore does not predict that the bicycle will become the only means of moving or we are only allowed to refresh ourselves with a thread.
The Mayor and Police Chief of Todana, due to a preventive development in a urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Todana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the Mayor and a hotel entrepreneur have been kept in mind because of the mutable suspicion of urban infringements, today it was from research circles.
The Council was arrested at his residence, from where he was brought to the municipal office and in its spaces he is located up to the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who were also found in the urban administration and in the local construction director Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the already last Monday in Galicien, Murcia and Madrid, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of unclosed construction ground for urban construction projects should be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction firm Nuaria. These should be established on the property 4000 apartments after the local administration is able to read illegal provisions during the last legislature period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly but were subject to an investigation procedure caused and carried out by the first Court of First Instance.
The first six arrests have been presented to the Judge today.
According to research circles, Juan Morales is also identified against the former Mayor of Totana and currently independent PP-deputed Juan Morales.
His exfrau, owner of a property company registered in Todana, as well as its current, retiring friend in Murcia, is suspicious.
The chairman and holder of the Nuaria group , who is based on Vigo lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the Managing Director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company was supposed to have served as a group of Nuaria and received the Schmiergeld.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban delicte, under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives also took 11 further tests, most of them in companies who were directly related to arrests held in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Todana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Todana: the holder of a regionally known poultry industry, who should have acted as a medium-sized man.
The Nuaria Construction Group was commissioned to establish the largest residential complex of the village of Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2,2 million square miles [2.2 million km] of area, which was aimed at building a construction project which would increase the population of the community to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar that promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which in Vigo the parking of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and preconiza, specializes the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to find a price label of other name with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to present your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains us yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat, published comment (Finland, on the other hand, is at the top of the PISA Studie), which refers to the position published in the same newspaper, on 18 November, and randomly to that day, whose edition was the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of philosophy has become the subject of the public debate after the tragedy on the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murder is an abiturant who quoted the works of Platons and Nietzsches in his news.
In an interview of the daily newspaper of the Helsingin Sanomat, the Chair of Education for the philosophy, Pekka Elo, called for the teachers to take a more critical position against Platon and suggested that Platons should be distributed from the sub-level learning plans for the philosophy of Gymnasien.

A colleague informs about the recording of illegal internet downloads into the criminal law:
A. The download of a song would be a law break that would be committed with six months of imprisonment.
However, if you retreat a music business under a value of 400 euros, this is only considered as a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
For example, if you extract the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the diet steel will be used as penalties, yet the penalty is lower than a download (Article 234 penalty book).
C. If you clause a car and return it forty hours later, the punishment is still lower than at a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a slaughter than in a music data exchange.
A prison penalty of three to 12 months after itself (Article 154 criminal law) takes place in a rebel contradiction, while the exchange of data has resulted from a free movement of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the penalty book).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the criminal law book, sexual disadvantage at work is considered less worse than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade with copyright-protected films, whose authorization has not taken place by the authors, is suspended to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film materials to minor years (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have the right, then someone has given up his claims very much.

My home doctor exceeds me one of his long, strange research articles titled: Money leads to the activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more about it.
The feelings generated by the monthly payment are thus dependent on the amount of the colleagues.
The study was created by a tomographic-magnetical reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, the writer of the study and director of the Bonn Hirn Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participants gave correct answers and, on the other hand, his competitors failed.
The researchers could recognize that the brain activities always feel very moderate when both participants were correct with their answer and thus received the same salary; but when one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure if there is so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
State lawyer from the Balkan
Carla del Ponte has been inevitably flying after the criminals of the Balkan Wars for eight years. Its office is located in the prosecution of the Court of Justice of the former Yugoslavia at La Haya.
Her mandate will run out the end of the year, and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the main responsibility of the Massaker of Srebrenica - the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - namely the Ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be free foot.
Their name is listed on the list of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's name as a template for the title of his documentary film La List de Carla (2006, not still running in Spain); a film pursued by the pace of a Polit-Triller the Swiss state lawyer from Belgrade to New York in their project, to find the missing criminals and to put the respective governments under pressure, in order to make them closeer their networks.
What insurance is the best for me?
The KFZ insurance which covers a possible damage caused by the driver includes a high cost effort, whose amount depends on different factors, including age, sex, time creation of the driver's certificate, family status, type of the vehicle to be assured, etc.
To possess a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear what we have to do here.
A car insurance scheme is an agreement between a insurance company and a insurance undertaking.
This agreement shall be held in writing by means of a insurance contract which determines that the company receives the promised insurance premium and is obliged to introduce the corresponding amount of loss in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance composed by several factors, including ages, sex, time of creation of the driver's certificate, family status, type of the vehicle to be assured or used.
Insurance companies shall determine their prices in accordance with statistics so that higher accident risks will also be due to higher contribution payments.
For this reason, over 25 years of both women and women need to pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups, thanks to their caution, have a lower accident rate.
The same applies also to married persons, since, according to the statement of the statistical values and according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to be less accidents than alone.
The benefit measured to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent use, the more likely the damage.
In setting the premium, insurance is required to take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also carefully study the situation in order to select exactly the car insurance that meets its personal needs.
We are now listening at this point to the most important points to be taken in the choice of insurance, not only in order to meet a high-performance choice, but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds take place in the choice of a price-effective insurance on numerous obstacles, such as the low driving practice and the young leader's certificate.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete a fullcasko insurance, there are still more priceless alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a full cab with self-participant so that the services of a full-coco insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay for itself part of the amount created by damage.
The amount is set before the contract and the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, the main representative of Spain at First Europe, an online insurance company.
Another option is the advanced insurance that ensures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damages created on the own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years old, it is your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate in the corresponding insurance company.
On the other hand, a penal payment includes an increase in the rates stated.
The amount of credits and criminal payments depends on society and their earnings.
If the company has a rich year behind it, it can be possible to increase bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year brand is exceeded, it is easier for the driver to conclude a contract. This is why the accident rate decreases with increasing cycling practice.
It is therefore the most useful to decide for a full-casko insurance with self-participant.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of driving, explain the Spanish leader of the European company, and add that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner was postponed.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to conclude a full-casko insurance; of course, only if it permits the financial situation of the corresponding person.
As a result, couples with children are considered to be the least accidental rate, and their contributions are therefore low.
In this case, a full-casko insurance with self-participant (at a amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended that only takes place for the third vehicle year.
They drive more relaxed and have a larger purchasing power that allows them to make a higher payment, determines Luis Noguera.
For pensioners it is necessary to complete self-participant insurance (for an amount of 150 euros) or an extended insurance which only takes place in sufficiently high credit.
Finally, we must note that the car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages, but also because it makes high costs that require a thorough choice that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan on the point for the Achtelfinale
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point at the coming Tuesday in San Siro that they lack to achieve their respective goals before the end of the Championsleague front round. The Italians need to reach the top of their group, while it decides on their participation at the Scottishs.
The Italian team has already five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a distinction in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not meet the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of the group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth round of play, as the FC Milan must enter the FIFA World Championship in Japan, where he is fighting for the first time in the semi-final for the first time to the final end that takes place on the 16th.
This group will be completed before all the others and the difference in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadion at all the way expected, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltic Glasgow that they would have in the case of a Sieges grouper and thus have a better starting position in the Achtelfinale.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be able to rely on such circumstances in a loop of the FC Shakhtar's case to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not all too much trust in such circumstances, because at nine points the level of equality the Ukraines is allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but could win at the second game (2-0).
Thus, the email countries will try to miss the Scottishs the evening. The restoration hopes to reach the eightelafinal of the transformed championsleague for the second time after they were defeated in the prescribed season in exactly the same round by a gate of Kaka in the after-play time (1-0) and by a zero to zero indispensable on the game.
During the FC Shakhtar waiting for the winner of Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the Achtelfinal and its membership with UEFA depend on his victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European Championship, the Benfica Lisbon could reach the third place and thus play with the UEFA.
20.000 people visit the first concert of Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the views of 20.000 viewers of the starting committee for their first tour after the resolution of the band in 2000.

Around the 20.000 people, the concert was able to experience in the outerated stadium where a video on the history of the band had been shown for Furore at the end of the nineties.
The reconciliation and the world tour is crossing with the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hits and two new songs, headlines and Voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls carried on the stage of golden armbands, which had given them to the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fanmas in the audience, which brought the GM Palace to glorious, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had prohibited it in the past days.
During the preparations to Schow, Victoria Beckham said that the British Star did not have any time to face our garderobe, so I'm already very excited what he will keep from the appearance.
Sporty Spice , whose exit from the group in 1998 due to the differences in mind two years later moved the group's resolution, expressed its nervousity two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world publicity had changed that the feelings had changed to the spice Girls.
And therefore I thought why not; so I am glad to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed the separation of the band that she had made nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes were removed and are now all very pleased again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last common appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
Firstly, the group arrived after reporting by TV TV in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
At their arrival at the airport, the band was received by a army from children's girls.

In Madrid they will enter the stage on 23 December.
New fears on ground gas conflict between Russia and Ukraine
A new pricing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the danger that Russian exports from fuel to Western Europe are affected.
The largest part of the Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) is guided by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is well observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow has to pay for the gas, it will take account of the higher transit fees in Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries has reduced deliveries to the EU States last year.
The recent conflict between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom try to agree on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be more calculated as the group agreed to pay up to 50% additional for gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analytics say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversation," said Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh’s Economic Minister of News Agency Reuters.
"The changing gas prices should, without doubt, be linked to our arguments on the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last large natural gas conflict between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom shortened deliverys to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which drastically drove the prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has developed the world's largest gas stocks, but much of it remains under-developed.
The result is that Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "sus foreign workers control"
The Scottish state health service must improve the controls of the pre-straf register for workers outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation by the Head of Finance Supervisor Robert Black, after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought to Zusammmenhang with the attack on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish state health service does not provide precise ideas regarding the number of foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
As a result of the attack on the Glasgow Airport, the main financial controller examined staff, which was recruited outside the European Economic Area countries.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, a Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport, after the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in October in a video transfer, and was charged in connection with the Mutual Autobomben attack in Britain.
It is expected that the state health service is conducting preliminary controls of foreign employees in order to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although health authorities use disclosure Scotland to verify pre-straf registers, the Agency does not have the power to receive this information outside the UK.
In addition to other recommendations, the report by the Chief Auditor states that the Board should take guidelines on the criminal register extract, helping employers in controls in different countries.
"Though we found evidence of these checks in some personal documents, they were not performed routinely.", the report stated.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research directives before setting up high degrees, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved in order to ensure that detailed information on the number of foreign health service employees is available."
BMA Schottland President Dr. Peter Terry said it would be "extremely unlikely," that studies in the preliminary field of the creation of potential NHS employees would identify people who could handle future terrorist attacks.
"In the report, it says that the current preliminary tests of the NHS of Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will be provided," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they have currently 1.161 foreign employees, the most important majority of these doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number of people likely was higher, even so because the boards had problems identifying those employees who have been authorized at unlimited time.
The investigation continued that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were mainly observed.
These include pass-, work permits and qualification controls.
the Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for controls before the start of the adoption of foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern for me to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack on the airport Glasgow."
It supplemented that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would reflect the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on control investigations would be reflected in the preliminary application of all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.

208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist competitor
Saudi Arabia has discovered yesterday that it took 208 militants because of their tranquility to cells that had planned an outstanding attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles.
Sympathists of Al-Qaida have started a campaign against the Monarchy, which has been a United States' bonder since 2003, as a result of the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by an foreign citizen, planned a attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, after the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 3,000 man strongly fast interceptors to protect plants after a lack of al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an innocence declaration, says that 18 of the arrests were part of a cell led by a "racte expert" who illegally migrated into the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smugg eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
Other 22 of the prisoners had proposed the report to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned to do more clergy to stop Saudis, who are struggling to fight with Al Qaida Milizen, who wants to fight the Al Qaida military forces and the US-sponsored Jewish Muslim government, which is considered by the hardliners under the Sunnite Saudis as a chain.
Al Qaida Milizen considers many clergymen in Saudi Arabia as in collaboration with the authorities in support of the royal family policies that dominate the government.
The militants - accompanied by the calls of Osama bin Laden, who were born in Saudi Arabia, Al Qaida, aimed at the prosperous Saudi government - have looked at foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy plants.
"This was a very great effort for the security forces over the last... five months," a speaker of the Interior took part in the state television.
The arrests also took place in a "Medien cell" of 16 of Medina, who aimed at acquisition of the "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical sunny Muslims, supporting violence against Muslims, who are marketed as unbelievers and apostate.
Among the arrests, 32 people who were accused to have made financial support to the militants.
The Venus climate could show a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may have been a pleasant place to live once, scientists said yesterday.
Data of a European space ship on a tramway show that the planet is more equal to a decorated force on the earth than has been conscious.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planet railways, but the Venus of the Sun is something closer.
billions of years ago, on Venus’ conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could even be inhabitable, scientists today believe.
But because of the most unbreaked carbon dioxide effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sun-inflation and a slower rotation rate, Venus started a very different development course.
Today, the planet of water is robbed and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to smelt lead and is destroyed by hurricanic winds and lights towers.
The knowledge of the Venus Express space health of the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for a year, provides a fascinating view of how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of Venus Express Mission, said: "It is clear why the climate on Venus is so different from the earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enables us to build a scenario where the Venus has started billions of years ago like the earth, perhaps with an inhabitable environment."
"Clicked Uran" by the police
A Kilo radioactive material, according to reports enriched Uran, was beaten yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said that three persons were arrested and that the material is examined.
He did not confirm whether it was an enriched uranium but said that it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
All still open
In the middle of Romey, he said that he was not worthy of a presidentship candidate to be asked by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the republican candidate for the presidency finally declared himself ready to discuss YouTube, take questions on video in the normal chooser and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions that were raised on Wednesday evening, 28 November, were as sad as the snowman, who asked the Democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party that burst in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with the choice of the next candidates to show YouTube Clips.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was devoted to one issue, immigration was focused on.
The topic is one of the most dramatic topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of unentirely electors to use a selective disc when they heard things that were fought to them: The television event observed tops of the consent as the candidates were strictly talking about the limits.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who went forward in the crucial surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake the reputation that he was in line with illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts to have illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly heavily disagreed as a questionr asked whether one of the candidates would support a "Amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility for the citizenship).
Uninterpretant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Calibernic Congress Deputy, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressor from Colorado, managed to follow this topic.
None of the two men have serious opportunities for nominalization, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have been more and harder than others to immigration.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates share the same views in large and all: sharper limits, intolerance toward illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
The debate, however, was clearly problematic than other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinking should be considered to be a torture.
One of the questionrs asked if the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa, thanks to his long-term Christian conservativeism, said that death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was urged to support Jesus, he laughed about it, and Jesus said was too intelligent to apply for himself for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally far open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Paul's latest donor and his adverse towers in the Wednesday debate.
These two are shooted out of nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to rely on one of the well-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has joined the party from the beginning and convincingly with a vigorous message of the size of America and a dancer to both of the party's wings.
This time the party has been divided and the result is far from being clear.
Labour party pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another rub to fall; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly sweating.
No title seems to be sold, no politicians of Paris's hotel accounts, no extraordinary toes were made.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has deteriorated donations for the British governmental Labour party over $650,000 for four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something without the polluted Gordon Brown.
When two months ago the President-in-Office had dealt with the demand for a choice, the intelligence of Britain was discriminated by claiming that opinion questions had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, who, increasingly sharply devoted the Liberal Democrats, developed the once feared Brown from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unsensitted rescue of Northern Rock, a coupled bank, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgment under the committee.
Bad proposals to amend tax laws have brought company associations against the government.
The tax-private loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed indifferent administrative peppers.
A General trio in peace began a retreat in the upper house of protests against reductions in military expenditure: to be minister of military forces, they claimed that they were part-time work.
Now there are the various donations of David Abraham; Peter Watt, Labours General Secretary (and her former leader) has already come back.
Nothing meant that Brown breaks up incontinuous direction.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel impossible to rule it.
Neither may nor have trust in human politicians, but they normally retain their creation when a new troop takes the office.
Once it is clear that a Prime Minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he does not need to be a long time, it is over: the public service starts to become unwise; the Ministers of Cabinet begin to plague; the press looks for bad news; and the government will become defensive and purposeless.
In one way, the position of Brown is particularly difficult because in contrast to other political leaders he cannot claim to be a new concern.
So he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his head leeutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax disclosure documents, for example, hang together with decisions that Brown met as the Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's misappropriate - as with the long "gold for adel title" research of political parties - the choosers may expect it to be.
Still, Brown's situation is not as bad as she looks like
The wrongs are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, nobody died, or was totally exposed.
And the contradiction, painful as it may, is distributing what Brown's natural stalinistic trends always promised: A reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new spirit for political donations is a good example.
The garbage Abraham, who compares his donations with his common gifts, does not wish to have public recognition for his well-beings.
It may be like that, but the decision on it was not allowed.
The laws against anonymousity for large political contributions are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Whatt, he said of Abraham’s agreement, but not that she is illegal, will of course have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial driver who was told about the unusual donations in October.
However, Brown is not involved: there is nothing that suggests that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments after his takeover was made in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He has quickly condemned the infringement of the laws by his party, but he was desperate of this determination by the farewelling by a well-known instrument, an investigation committee on the subject - to complete the measure, by a bishop in a tranquility and a judge.
In this case, the "outward teachings" are not very complicated.
When the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
In addition, there is other things that Mr Brown has to do, how to find a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in public life that has been unemployed for six months, and to progress with a profound reform of political parties finance.
This would be required by the Labour's hardliners to cooperate with conservatives and perhaps give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party partner like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in the surveys; it has two years to recover choosers; and the only way to reach a victory is through inconsistency and solid competence.
Cardhaie
Does the credit-crisis of the American credit card market ?
If blood is in water, it is only natural that flashings are excited.
Now where America's real estate market crowns, the Raubtiers have the credit card market of the country in the fisherman.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect that credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the infect of underfinanced loans spread to other forms of consumer credits.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are rises in both the payments and the cleaning rates measured the share of the loans which are not incurable or more than 30 days too late.
The HSBC has announced in the last month that she has taken a $1.4 billion from its American consumer finances, partly due to the weakness of credit card customers.
Still, it's too early to fall in panic.
Losses and conditions are still low.
According to the rating agent Moody, the third-quartal acid rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the Councils can, in part, be explained by technical factors.
An amendment to the American private insolvency law in 2005 resulted in a abrupt case of bankruptcy claims that are renewed for a large part of the chain card losses; the number of notifications (and so that the fees of treatment) would rise again, whether the general conditions for creditors are deteriorated or not.
The industry also reports of solid payment rates which show how much consumers pay their debts each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the suspension in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, calculates that the volumes of expenditure for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Directly infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are sure: it is more likely that consumers take credit cards, now drying own home credits.
However, the carriers look at the flow of money instead of capital values, therefore, losing home prices not necessarily a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even be advantageful for the card publisher.
The incentives for consumers that continue to pay mortgage rates are reduced when the property is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt will be more important among the return priorities.
Cards may also respond much faster and flexibler than creditors to more disturbing conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid reassessment of assets.
"We won't awake one day and completely re-evaluate the loan," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial referendum.
Even if a sudden detection crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustainable declining are more real.
If lower household prices and credit reductions in America in the recession, industry will undoubtedly face a worse future.
Keep them watching these hairflashes.
British bankers claim guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who were to be put before court for their role in the fraud system with the former Head of Finance of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their quests on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally had seven cases of fraud using telecommunications resources for supposed conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 in order to reach themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was set on January.
But during a hearing before court before U.S. Distriktrichter Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded for a case of fraud using telecommunications products.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, one of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during the two years of delivery procedures.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The original claims against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the aim of an investigation of the government in connection with the enron downfall.
The claims against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claim that they had come to Houston in 2000 to cut out a fraudian competit with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Koper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless misleading enron majesties, who contributed to breaking the company into the conkurstrudel.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated its participation in the subsidiary company to zero, but the three British men knew that it really had significant value.
A company under copper control acquired the shares of the bank in the subsidiary for 1 million dollars.
The bankers paid heads $250,000 for participation in this company.
According to the claim, Fastow misleaded Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its share in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, heads and other about 12.3 million dollars, according to the claim.
In January 2004, Fastow was guilty of his role in the Enron's plea in two charge points of conspiracy.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a six-year prison sentence in Louisiana's Federal Prison.
Copper is a three-year penalty and a month penalty in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot on the basis of a $1 million cheese that required them to live in the United States in the expectation of the court proceedings.
Enron, once the seventh-great company of the nation, broke down in the concurrence in December 2001, after years of bookkeeping tricks could no longer give rise to the billion debts or weakening businesses.
The collapse made thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron-Gründer Kenneth Lay and the former chairman Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year for their roles in connection with the enron collapse.
Skilling has a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's condemnations for conspiracy, fraud and other accusations were negligible after he died last year because of heart disease.
Not entirely below in Moscow
The price of a plane of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough reach to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it is for a private family or a company president."
Firer was on the Gulfstream stand on the last Friday at the millionary exhibition, a four-day orgy of the viewed consumption, which was organised in an incredible exhibition centre on the city edge of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibitions, hoping to interest newly come Russians at all, from Mahagoni-getfelt yachts to diamond-overed car grills that were appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer took care of a shiny orchanical Porsche at the next fair stand.
"This is a nice car, but it's small money compared with us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree the Russian capital seems to be overflowing with money like Dallas at its glossy times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in Scharen, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at Davis Center for Russian and European Studies at Harvard University.
As the Saudi Arab survivors of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the most visible freezing money makers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are searching for their share in the gold roast.
Anderswo in Moscow, this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the President of LVMH, has attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell high-priced goods on markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, one of the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars in total of 282 billion, according to the Forbes list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaries are the second class worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of the Russians lived under the existence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaries in Moscow - so we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a selling and marketing president of David Morris, a London jewelier.
She had visited the fair for the first time with the Russian trader of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well cared for example, and the men are all worthy."
During Sunday night in evening clothing through the halls, two real estate killers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 are called themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked after the cars, and I was trying to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing her like a Red-Teppich-Veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily to focus on the new ones, the type of marked-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand several hours in the stake in order to visit a close camphouse, which was tastelessly Cadillac Escalades, bag measuring from Platin, Mövenpick Eiskrem, customized Billardtic, Appartments in Dubai and Gund Teddybären.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning what mark is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Urath, who patrioticly sat at a fair stand of the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft before a wally imitation of a rembrandt image made of hand painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is according to Russian standards old) have already moved from largely clean logos to the kind of nutritional brands with limited numbers that would not market themselves at a trade show.
Yet, several thousands of people urged millions of millions of millions or simply tourists every day through the halls.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday, Roman Ershov said, the General Manager of King Koil Beds here, he had sold two 700,000 dollars of matratzensets made of silk, caschmir and cotton, with awesome gold vessels.
At the same time in the first night, Michail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said that a company has paid high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the grey ornate Porsche for $17,000 to a Russian millionary.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, said a company that adapts luxury cars to customer wishes that he had sold three car cooler grilles for a rolls-Royce Phantom, which similar chain armbands to each other, for 5,000 dollars.
He showed a reporter a car tyres developed for a Russian casino owner with specimens that he had overridden with colored swarovski crystals, so it looks like a Rouletterad.
The costs: $22,000 for a four-supper.
"The Russian millionary, the current leather bicycles or a picture of his wife’s face from cubic circony will not necessarily travel on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-wage garage."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the Phrase "Russic Millionary" would currently not express a lot of exclusiveity in view of the rise in the present real estate prices.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably millionary, at least on the paper if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of those than you believe."
Those who were not millions of people could at least do as if they were rich in a state operated by Allianceř, a Russian property management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells after British example that were complete with mountains of false million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the Marketing Director of the Company, said his employees had expressed 5000,000 false banknotes for the millionair fair.
Passengers stopped to throw the cabinets, mobile photographs, while rejecting in the midst of the substitute, cutting by friends, or simply to put in a few millions.
"See in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionary," said Mr. Karryev.
Prestigious operation suspects death in New Jersey
It was the day before the winner of the harvest as Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier Restaurants here and observed two doors on the white Cape Cod held down at the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the cabinet of the medical viewer," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone died."
The hearings learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was a assistant of the director of the Newerk Police Desert.
Now the mediators are trying to determine whether they died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorised cosmetic surgery that the police did not identify, and who worked in the house at the West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet detected what Mrs Arroyos has caused death and are hopefully that toxocological studies whose results could not be available for weeks will be helped to clear a mysterious death that sent a grief through the head of the newark police.
Ms Arroyo was a police director since September 2006, Garry F. McCarthy, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and hardnecking," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pistbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms Arroyo was the woman of Jimmy Arroyo, a former necessary police officer working for the alcohol control co-mission and that she leaves two sons, 14 and 11 and a step-drawer.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that mediators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorised surgery.
"This is one of the opportunities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Ms Arroyo on a sofa.
She was explained on the place for death.
More than one week has passed and the authorities have notified little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Ms Castro was asked by the authorities.
The mediators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castros House where a wooled rose strap stands in the tiny pregnancy and a dalmatiner rolls behind the house.
A blue fass described with "etyl Vanillin" - used as a replacement for fanille in food and parfumes - sat in the parking area next to a door that led to the substrate.
Two mountain bikes hanged from Haken on one side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark for the first time after 25 years with the New York police department, Ms. Arroyo was of incredible value and helped him to find up in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You must take care of this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing."
Hope of reducing interest rates will lead to an increase in the world's markets
The shares jump yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the Central Bank will try to rest the credit markets by further interest reductions, by strengthening significant comments by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The share markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the President of the Central Bank, said that flexibly and pragmatic policies should respond to the continuing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to rest devastating markets, given signs of challenging credit tensions, Cohn said that recent turbulences would "partly have reversed some of the improvements of market functions from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence is maintained, it would increase the possibility of further enlargement of the financial conditions for consumers and companies, he said.
The comments were noted by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is ready to record and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital pipes to the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The statements also helped to calm down Wall Street, given further bad news from the US economy, since the sales of US mobiles reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their worldwide workers, in a measure for reduction of costs in order to compensate serious losses from their lost goods in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the Bank is 1.500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index was spread by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close 13.289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standards.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6% and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3%.
Before that, the resumption of credit pressure on the markets was underscored after a strong demand for a auction of three months guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to the European Trade Banks had been granted 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to borrow other capital funds into the markets in London, increased when credit voltages have risen to the three months "Libor" Councils to lending between UK banks with 6.59 percent to their highest since the late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronted with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to be a number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of election, is at least under this special title, here to help the head trainer Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan, and because the table of High Morries, the English Managing Director, is gradually filled with applications for national electoral officers, if not even for those in parttime.
Whoever does not get the sixth slander position, will be unhappy, but life is often injustice and the sport is undoubted.
It is never easy to look exactly at what a person allows to reach the top of his professional branches, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest ranking, sometimes from lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult where judgments are needed that are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same may also be asked in another area whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with good bills that know the business should be transported.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricket player unless it is given the possibility to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but opportunities also have this.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the eye of the captain at the right time when he can take a Wick, and a sleeve must get regular opportunities on the order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricket player.
Starting the eyes of the selector is more complex.
There were many who were better in the last season than James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison himself explains for healthy and like the wind is in the networks.
Anderson took 32 prime Wickets with every 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same moderate average, but both had their glosses and hoped more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play in the Asgiriya Stadium can be only one question of view.
The choice could be made by both men, or it may make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was still fighting to fortify the breakthrough to a major test cricket player and who, although he pointed a double dog against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in the course of today’s network session at the Asgiriya Stadium, their conservative instincts and abdominal feelings for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara's youthous enthusiasm will follow.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his funny and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay, 43 best hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years old, and an excellent balance against spined balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his homearia as a player from Middle Sex, and this, with his immediate refusal of the choosers as Vaughan, was healthy to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing from his strokes that was still manifestly in Bombay.
On the other hand, the all kings from Essex have spectaclely life-frequent.
He was impressed by nothing on a cricket square and his position was taken on the other hand when he had overlapped a vehicle with four wheel drive in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to remove his vodafone (naturally also sponsored place) and to call on his team colleagues Alastair Cook, who had observed this from the distance, and with enthusiasm saying, "Do you see this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he conveys his mean rate with some effect here on the playgrounds, which seems to fit to him and strikes with confidence and swiftness.
To choose the right man is one thing to choose the right time to choose another.
Perhaps this is the actual art of the selection.
I tend to give Bopara now his chance, what doesn't mean that Shah may not be well there if, as the tea set of Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight Al-Quaida
The first bus charges of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Bagdad yesterday, with a current of distributors whose money or visas have gone out, and others who hoped that the city returned to normality.
Some even came back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, still before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen bush, the terminal was operated with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned to private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Bagdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a sunny doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw in TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Bagdad, and how it was now sure."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the shooting militant cleriker Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to reset at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiitean teacher from the most important sunnyt part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqian regime was not allowed to work.
His shitian neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local Miliz, supported by the United States, contributed to drive Al-Qaida from their base in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new armies from Jordan was the leader of a sunny and shitish tribe who had been distributed from his house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdads by an attack with handgranates after he had invited his fellow citizens to combat Al-Qaidas.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-al Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and those of my boys.
That's why I have returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they were locked by the growing tranquillity in the capital since the U.S. truck increase and the growth of local "groups affected" citizens, which armed and defended their district in cooperation with the American military.
But more talked about being forced to go home by visa problems and passing money in Damascus, where over 1,3 million Iraqians had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exhibitors that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Minister-President, who asked Syrian Government to rely on visa restrictions for refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the seceterian death swadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki Syria and the government urged the Iraqians to give no visa to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunnitic pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I went away."
A part of the cause for the decline in violence is that Sunnits were distributed from the diversity and reversed, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will scare sectic tensions again and will come to conflicts.
Littles Saarland, Good Education
The smallest state of Germany is leading to professional training, even with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one education field the Saar countries press the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I've explained for the 50th time of a non-saarland that we are not French" - this Slogan pastes the smallest federal country itself to his 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of Saarland, which is located on five in the educational monitor of the Institute of the German Economy of Cologne (IW).
Thus, the universities are already cooperating closely with neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can conclude their study with a double or even three-fold diploma here.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But also the national children bring Saarland into higher average number to the universities - many of them without a conclusion at the Gymnasium.
"In Saarland you are using the professional education system", says Axel Plünncke, education expert at IW.
More than every fifth youth acquires his course of study at a professional school, allowing Saarland to be more than seven percent points above the German average.
The combination possibilities of professional and academic training are also strongly developed in a comparative way.
Measured at the population number, the facilities with dual study courses are the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineers in recent years has fallen by one third.
The Saarland Ministry of Education has therefore committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering experts.
"To the general educational schools we have infringed some reforms after the first Pisa study," says one speaker of the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government launched national comparison tests.
In order to start learning the children earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is now also copying other federal countries.
Whether the performances of the students are sustainablely improved, only future comparison studies will show.
At Pisa in 2003, the share of risk schools increased from 29 to 20 percent.
On the whole, Saarland did not increase as much as other states.
The Bayerns are better expecting.
And for the disturbance of the Saar countries, foreign language knowledge is not measured at Pisa - in this area you could otherwise point.
Because the language of the neighbors is obligation to Gymnasia - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez converts the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks are then different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez lets the timers turn back in the South American country at half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to the new law, the clocks are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
In this way, the state of South America gets a time zone that is not in any other country in the world.
The U.S. hostile Chávez found his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world had set up the division in time zones to full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced the cancellation of the relationships with the neighboring country of Colombia on Wednesday (local time) because of a hostage.
The left nationalist said that as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia is staying, he will not be held to the Head of State or to the Colombian Government.
"I can't do this for my dignity alone," said Chávez, who advances a constitutional reform that the citizens of the Oilland have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would clearly expand his power in the country.
The fighter was the decision of Uribes to withdraw Chávez the mandate for negotiations with marxist rebels in Colombia, with which the release of prisoners was concerned.
Uribe had been criticized on Sunday by Venezuela with his decision.
Chávez is also in Spain in all the mouths.
A new cell phone clingelton provides for Furore in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't think the mouth) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half million people from the Internet.
Gesprochen has made him Spain's king Juan Carlos, who had been generous from the constant calls of the left populist on the latest Ibero America summit.
German threatened 2007 wage minus
In spite of the strong conjuncture, German workers are threatening a prognosis as a result of this year's loss of real wage.
Experts called a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees in 2007 could really count on the balance account less than in the previous year.
"There is the moderate wage development, the increase in added value and price rates in food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjuncture Research of the "image" newspaper.
New burdens could also benefit from workers' unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent of the annual change is properly and reasonable in the present situation.
However, if the Federal Agency did not have to come back in a suspension of asking for loans or grants, the SPD policy was quoted.
On Tuesday, the rate of inflation has been driven to the highest level for 13 years by price explosion in food and mineral oil products.
The total prices increased by 3.0% in the annual comparison.
Venus is the höllic willing of the earth
The Venus is more similar despite its life-of-life atmosphere than before: The European Space Unit "Venus Express" has discovered Blitzze in the atmosphere and wind turbulence to Poland, as it occurs on the earth in winter.
Since almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it is blooming on Venus.
Now, the European Sonde "Venus Express" has given evidence - she felt electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The venue shooting on Venus at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Rusel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen-Theory" blitzze created life on earth: wools should have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, there must be been in the very early history," said Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there should be little life on the Venus surface: the atmosphere is about a hundred times dense than on the earth, there are temperatures of 500 degrees below.
"The Venus is perhaps the devil willing of the earth, but it's a twin," Russel said.
Why the Venus, which the earth is so similar in mass and size, has embraced such a totally different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus Research, as since the beginning of the nineties no more than one was on the way to research this planet.
The latest research results presented in several "natural" articles are not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the commonities of our neighboring planet are greater than being adopted at first," the Esa tells us.
In this way, researchers found, next to the already known whirlwind on the North Pole, a cloud drumpel on the South Pole, which is still much faster.
The phenomenon reminds air streams in the earthly winter hemisphar, writes a team of Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istito di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second indent of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet also referred to as morning or evening stars creates about 225 days around the sun.
But he is much slower around himself: a venue day takes 243 earth days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds the earth, scientists assume that both planets have been created under similar conditions.
On both, waters that remained in oceans were gathered on earth, but they lost Venus into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbon stones, Venus makes it the vast part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkels Meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end of the party conflict for the receipt of Dalai Lama in the Kanzler Office.
Indirect, he criticized the SPD for their attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares for the presence of Germany and called for the great coalition to end the dispute to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation in this question," Köhler said the trade sheet.
At the same time, Köhler signalized understanding for the reception of Dalai Lama by Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the differentity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany had to realise sensitive balance in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel was protecting the preface, and it was a new China policy.
"The German Chancellor has not taken a distance from the traditional one-China policy.
This also knows China," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly recognized unmut on the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked from the Union's series.
He had, among other things, accused the Union's shooting policy in foreign policy.
After receipt of the Dalai Lamas in the Kanzler Office, there was a strong irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has invited not only the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also the so-called Strategic Dialogue of Foreign Ministers in both countries, after information from the SPIEGEL.
China's Head of State Wen Jiabao now invited Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel to file the receipt of the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
When European politicians have officially received the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The deeds and words of Dalai Lamas showed that he was trying to distribute Tibet and the other tibetic region, which includes other modern provinces.
Schäuble warns from crawalls like in France
Street slaughter with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against crams like in France.
It was necessary to do everything so that social unreasonableness in Germany should not be discharged in the street, the Federal Minister of State called for.
Barrikaden burned, Randalierer shot with screwflints on the police: According to the heavy youth crawls in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to ensure that not also our social vapour builds up and discharges in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hannover.
Not every young man comes to the rapid change in social reality.
Coincides, countries and municipalities have already worked with emphasis on reducing problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"The first successes have been shown from the integration summit until the Islam conference."
However, it is too early for a warning.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs such as in France.
During the past nights, young people had delivered severe street slaughter with the police in northern advances of Paris.
Also in Toulouse burned cars and public buildings.
However, the President of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded greater integration efforts in the Federal Government.
In the light of the craws in France, Colat warned "surgery" effects.
Although the situation in Germany is not as brilliant as in France.
However, there is no need for action.
Colat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people with migration background was "surgery high" under 25 years.
It must be provided mainly for more educational places.
Kolat stressed: "We must give the young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish community added, in Germany more than in France "a social control in the families".
Many young people with migration also did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat told us: "But yet we need to be careful."
You must give young people "feel the opportunity to participate in work and training".
In the evening, it was largely quiet in Paris's predator Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of the police were in use, a helicopter overfloged the area with lightwers.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning wastes and cars.
Since the morning, a bid of about 1000 security forces provides peace.
The police will take through as long as it was necessary, Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after visiting the town.
In the evening on Tuesday, crawalls in Villiers-le-Bel had been injured about 80 policemen.
In the follow-up, the unrests passed over on toulouse.
The crawalls were disinfected by a traffic accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
After first knowledge of the prosecution, the police do not blame on the death of the young people.
In the Empire of Angela Wolke
The realistic appearance of the Chancellor documents that the coalition is at the end - and that there is nothing to be expected by her himself.
In what country does this German Chancellor live?
After her trostless appearance in the German Debate of the Bundestag, which was worst and poor, one must say: not here - not here in the country that would have to be ruled by her.
Angela Merkel has rejected an excessive set of words that she concentrate too much on foreign policy.
This was provincial, she said and showed only that she didn't want to understand what it is the critics.
In the Bundestag, she has documented for all recognized how much of its objection is true.
There was neither a specific interest nor a feeling to feel for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented: a retired politician who flews to foreign policy and itself stays in the imprisonment.
For example, climate protection: Because it is unbreakable for the decisions of Holydamm, but does not say how to reach the climate targets to this end.
Above all, the selflob - so much impartiality would have failed the CDU-Chefin for two years ago.
Now she's whispering to the flash that the uprising gets to the people.
With this, she damaged her image as a Praguematicist that solves problems instead of talking to the world beautifully.
But in the empire of Angela Wolke, inside political problems are a edge vision.
Children's tenderness and the concerns of the low ministers?
A few additions left them for it.
It is noteworthy how often she promises when it comes to the child.
Three approaches need Merkel to bring out a half-way straight sentence.
She stolples as on strange Terrain when it gets concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican Presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Midt Romney provide a hard stroke exchange – and have to be afraid of an external candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already discharged in the first theme.
He has made New York a "spot for illegal immigration", in the middle of Romney introduces his competitors Rudy Giuliani.
On the other hand, this contemporary with serious prerequisites: "I would say that his own house was a port for Illegale," Giuliani dismissed and commits the former governor of Massachusetts to have private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blame to the attack: Because the Republican basis still has no clear favorites, the eight Presidential lawyers are using the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-draaied 30-second videos that have sent Internet users via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolation, we have let Hitler come to power," said John McCain of his competitor Ron Paul, who as the only one in the round calls for an immediate deduction from Iraq.
Romney also receives a strong reading of the Levites from Vietnam-Veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding" a hormone method that simulates drinking as a torture.
However, that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and martyrdebattes show the reactions of the Hallpublik in St. Petersburg in Florida.
When conservative values are pricesd and future tax increases are rejected, the Auditorium Approved.
It shows even more where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
"I've been wrong at that time," said Romney screaming and laying for the basis and television publication for it that he was still part of the abortion supporters in 1994.
On the other hand, Giuliani comes into the clinging when he is asked for the original interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules first in civilians
One day after his retreat as the army Chief, the Pakistan power holder Musharraf has been defended as President.
This ends military rule in Pakistan for eight years.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has been authorised for another five-year-old term on Thursday.
The Pakistan television surrounded the ceremony in the presidency palace of the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had transferred his office as the head of army to Ashfaq Kiyani and thus suffocated international pressure from the U.S.
Eight years after his forced excavation, the former General now rules first as the civilian Head of State.
Musharraf had met a core request for opposition and the West with his return as commander of the forces.
Another central demand is an end of the exceptional condition that Musharraf had attached on 3 November.
Soon after his defense, Musharraf is going to raise the exceptional status according to Malik Muhammad Qayyum's lawyer and thus meets another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the Land, which had occupied Musharraf in the early November with his balanced jurisdiction, had rejected all claims against the controversial revocation of the Head of State on 6 October.
On the other hand, in the northern tribe region, the north-Wesirists were killed in an attack on a military convoy and four more injured.
According to information of a army speaker, the bomb exploded on a street near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the cradrock return
Germany's Supergroup of the Seventies again muzired: Harmonia's three band members once again took up their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
For revival, a meant from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The so-called Sensation then occurs in the form of three appointed men on the evening table.
Everyone has his boxes before himself, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
The Moebius threw in the bleached white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed by the Auditorium, Hans-Joachim Rultius, 73, focused on the console.
Everyone contributes noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes, it's surprisingly adding to a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to be greatly disturbed by the gentlemen.
That the band Harmonia again musized has provided some excitement under Krautrock lovers.
What can be revealed here: Family demands revealed that, although the name swallowed by the collective Pope Thought but not so sustainable to miss this band for 32 years painfully.
But why should not the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially what is misleading crautrock is called in England and America has always been more than in their own country.
When the music economy lost the survivors of the Cologne Group Can in 2003 the Echo Prize for Lifework, they were seen in the hall in demanding German pop viewers.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked for the bands La Düsseldorf and New!, the surprise did not know any limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother was hooking at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage like an old club.
The problem of ignorance at home and the V-Declaration in strange is one.
The memory is therefore overreached with Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years, and in this period also a much lower power of effectiveness than was assigned to them afterwards by others.
Moebius and Ruddelius had already muzired with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the many promised name Cluster.
First played in the Keller under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label held by the church.
Redher had shortly accessed power plants and then played a reputation as a guitarist with New!, the most radical German group at that time.
By 1973, however, Redher followed the cluster musician to the exile to Forst in the Westerbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruins from the 16th century, they lived as a cityy communion.
Less ideologically than in the communion I, where Rudely was allowed to pest as a child's girl.
Previously in a splendid artist.
A wimpel of the Harmonia Ottenstein vocal association and art also found itself a name in the locking garbage.
Some of them held Harmonia.
The first album was "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because so leaves and moderates the music, the band suffered material trouble.
The rice collection did not serve only the self-insufficiency.
The now published CD "Live 1974" was cut with a concert in Griessem before a almost 50-popular record culture, as someone believes to disagree.
From Rother, then, the desire to forsake Harmonia and sometimes practice.
For Ruddelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band explained her separation in 1975.
Reder landed in the Esoterian-Spherean and secured his existence with albums like "Flammend Heart".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and is even more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Greek live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
The plate company Greenland has aimed to care for the Krautrock as a timely German contribution to live music.
New! was already buried like Ruddelius Solowerk.
Harmonia's physical recovery takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidised, in the context of the Festival of Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the Manuscript "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
Where the entire bandwidth of the influences of the scrutiny would be surrounded to the following pop music.
Harmonia is filled out by the supergroup.
The set of Brian Eno sweats with the most unique sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you are the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with Harmonia in the Bauernstube.
Legend training serves projections of further black-white photographs of wirr cabled devices.
Before that, the three veterans were again discussed with improvisation.
Not any more by dressing microphones to the organ and the beat, in order to unarray the instruments via self-hased effect devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technical deepened fertilizers.
There is no change in the choir of the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morning stars, sound clouds are hooked and desperate and sang in a beautiful place with Emphaaaaah Emphaaaah.
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were found less in the Blues than in music high schools (Can), technologies (powerwork) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whosoever calls here "'68!' does not have injustice, and Harmonia does not now bring out of rest.
Still the most natural is carefully considered on stage.
Where does music begin and when does she stop?
This can give you great happiness to the nerves or flew moments.
Richard Gere is simply not sympathic enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Morderish Peace" two more films deal with the Balkan War.
But both are not convinced.
Of course, the concepts are too much on action and balls, or they are too stirring.
There can't be Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals of Karadzic and Mladic are still hidden in the mountains of the Balkan, but counted there, in the dark country of the Bosnia war, the actress Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighties last, because all too many net-interessed roles in well-fühling films for women and all too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism thrived one to the point of view.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes hunting" (Why should film titles be always as long and weird like Lokführer-Tarif contracts?) maybe.
He delivers a wonderful augence-winking presentation: In the basic sense, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could be done out of Gere if the fate and the film industry would not be so gnädig: A man who has its very best times behind him for a long time, but who even preserved significant rest of the first charm as a ruinous monument.
However, despite this trunk, "The Hunting Party" combines with the German production of "Mortheric Peace", which also starts this week only the endless series of missing Balkan War movies.
With "Mortheric Peace" you can make a short process: The film acts by two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a serbin from cosovarian hook guards, where one prompt is still in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the serbs are not once represented as a single root of all evils, the remote flat film loses all too quickly in balls and action.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a carbahn but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be researched exactly exampleally, why there has never been a right good Balkan war film.
The history of three American war reporters, who are experiencing to feel the Serbian chief war criminals "the Fuchs", could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time, with another director and another writer (e.g. in Personalunion Richard Shepard).
Because the Storys are even more fragile: both times small teams go into the woods to accomplish something that the militarys cannot be able to do, and both times it will be a journey into the whistles.
One of the reasons for the disappointment of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not easy to let the cynnician come down with heart when he is presented at the beginning.
No, the script must yet establish him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the Bach when the reporters succeeded in the time-out procedure, what Nato, CIA and all the world's head-payer did not work in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to the just rake.
This is so bad that you would like to call the International Court of Justice in Den Hague for crimes against cinema.
The film has a deepest human concern.
He wishes to claim that Karadzic and Mladic are still free to run, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they are supposed to agree for them) not to pursue the persecution due to secret political talks all too intensely.
But the good common and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous blast density comes into mind.
It says about the wood mask of an Asian dent on the worktable of the poet: "I see the swollen heads, utterly, how struggling it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but unequivocally how striving it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the Genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq films were Hollywood's great flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film yet.
Nearly always applies: If a star runs on the crises or mine fields around the world, then something comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia arquette, "John of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamants" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts may be too close at the time.
After all, it had to pass decades before Hollywood could rotate a good movie with "Schindlers List".
Some films are still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" now have never been celebrated as masterpiece at that time.
But maybe we know today where every mass murder in real time comes to the same two screens, too simply too much about the conflicts in the world.
And this robbers ride the uncertainty of concerns that it needs to tell good stories.
"Sein or nothing" or "The Great dictator" finally became so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin were not yet aware of how bad the Nazi regime really existed.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastic artist view of the Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When the "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War asked parallels between his historical novel and his Balkan war, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terrible, people will always be murdered in a cruel way and will always rule war in Yugoslavia."
By Beust commences criticism for Olympia-Absage
The retreat of the mayor of the Hamburg application for Olympic Summer Games has been infringed in politics and economy to severe criticism.
Many want to fight for the games on the water.
But by Beust realism in assessing the opportunities.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz's head officer of the Hamburg Board of Trade was a "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently developed as great motivation forces in the city as the Olympiaidee.
"Ohne this goal would not be able to maintain the sports policy at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz called for the Senate not to reject the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "see a changed time radiation".
Mayor Ole van Beust remained in former statements on Wednesday that at least 2028 the Olympic Ambitions were unrealistic.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Association," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the sports union decision expected for the beginning of December on the application of Munich for winter games 2018.
"This preference means for us that we will have no realistic opportunities in the period we have thought up to 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not allowed for all time, said by Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This is the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build a chance by being awarded the plans at that time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A dismissal of application also contradicted the Senat Chief's statement on the part of a receipt of the General German University Sports Association.
There, by Beust, the application of Hamburg for the Universiade 2015 "not as a replacement" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had nominated Hamburg as a candidate city in the last week.
The SPD bourgeois franc SPD filed the Senate not to have used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the small grassbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate, because he put on the map of Olympia and has exposed the building of apartments," said SPD-deputed Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the small grassbrook always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of living, the CDU has set one side on the "Event factor".
The application for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games had triggered a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at that time.
However, Hamburg was failed to Leipzig.
These are not warhole boxes.
Those who connect the terms Sweden and wooden box, think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or?
Currently, in Sweden, fabricated wooden boxes throw dark shadow on Warhol's work directory.
A large part of the four and nine there listed Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" are lapses.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Express" has scared doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes in 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to an intimidating result: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former Museum director Pontus Hultén has committed the moderna Museet 1995 as a defense, are copies - and also the vast part of the about a hundred further brillo boxes of "type Stockholm", which are in turn on the international art market.
The history is inclined, a confusing chain of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue white design of the cardboard of the soap pole "Brillo".
A exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museet 1968 - with Warhol's consent - made out of Pappe hundreds of Brillo boxes: these were not originated from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cartonage factory.
It was not artworks, but their examples, just exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol has probably granted the permission to produce a few Brillo-Holzkists in Sweden, which were not issued in the moderna Museet.
Timecrafts are now speaking of about fifteen boxes, which have then been authorized as an authorized original andy warhol-Brillo boxes with the term "type Stockholm" rightly entered the art and auction history.
Some of them have reached over $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later claimed falsely that in 1968 there were about a hundred wooden boxes produced and distributed in Sweden, which then left him to warhole.
In fact, Hulténs 105 boxes were produced in Malmö until 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time war was three years dead.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three of the six museum-owned brillo boxes from Swedish private owners, two of which have been made in Stockholm in 1968: your press team plates were first grounded and shrinked off, after that white oil was produced with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of copies from 1990 advises that the colour was directed on the press team with a painter role without a basis – and not on oil, but on acrylic color.

In July, the Authentication Board has announced that the "swore accusations" are taken into account in matters of the soap powder boxes.
But then there are indispensable silence.
