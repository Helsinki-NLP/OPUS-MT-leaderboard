Anrainers were called not to leave their houses. Buildings in around 500 meters were evakuated, schools and children's gardens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical work at the base of the Hiss, additives are produced for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US-Milliard Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict security records.
In the work, around 400 people work. Chemistry factory has already provided headlines in the past - approximately when a league exposed the gas methanthiol and the environment widespreadly after faul eggs smoking. In 2015, after an operational accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil fled into the city's wastewater system.
Woman announces her job to search for 57 days after her lost fortune
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her lost dog - and announced her extra job. The seven-year-old border of Collegie was out of the hotel room during a short stay in Montana. 57 days were missing from the Hündin every track - yet Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I was crazy," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". They and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had moved dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could still stay in the hotel, Carole King went to reception. "The employee says, "She is about four and a half hours ago"," Carole King remembers "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately out. Likely a loud thunder put the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the kings searched for their loved dog, but from days the kings were. "I never abandoned. I have never lost hope," said Carole King the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced their job as postal officer to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flash"
57 days after Katies disappeared, Carole King received an call: A man reported and said that Katie was in his court. But when King arrived there, Katie was already gone. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her hindin under a tree. "I just left her around. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flews. People kept in their vehicles, rose out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them."
Losses in the Federal War: Machine guns disappear spurless
Friday 27 September 2019
Six machine weapons of type MG3 are still disappeared.
Over the past years, the Federal War has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shoes munition. Below are also three machine weapons. Stay is unclear in most cases. Opposition speaks of a "angering" dimension.
In the federal war, weapons and munition are disappearing again - many of them have been spacious. Since early 2014, the Truppe has made the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and nearly 20.000 shoes of munition. This is the list of the Federal Defense Ministry, which reports the editorial network of Germany.
According to the paper from the Defence State Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, a army part and 3474 shots are reappeared. The still away weapons and arms parts are six machine weapons of type MG3, 11 weapons of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal pissols and two pistols of type P8. In addition, 30 guns for machine weapons of type MG3 are missing.
The extent of arms and munition losses in the federal war was "a fearful," said the left-bounded Martina Renner. This was more important because in the course of investigations it was hardly found. The left-politics spoke of a "deficiency balance". Renner criticized that the list would not be recognized whether under the lost munition were also found those who were found in connection with the investigations against the federal military officer Franco A. "And that although a supporter was sentenced by Franco A. recently because of the possession of this munition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its determination by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas today on Friday. As ship surveillance data from Rdefinitely showed, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. PortMeccaM was indicated as destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was already released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he first remained in Iranian waters. It was said that one wanted to wait for an official decision from Teheran.
On July 19, the "Stena Impero" was brought up by the Iranian Revolutionsgardes in Hormuz’s Sea Road to have suspected security provisions. However, Iran was suspected to respond to the controversial, temporarily determination of an Iranian oiltanker before the Gibraltar belonging to Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important marine roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped by the sea. The voltages in the region had intensified over the last months. The trade ship was taken into the conflict between the United States and Iran. It came to several interferences with tanks and drones.
Merkel values the courage of the people in the peaceful revolution
Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel würdiged the commitment of the people in the DDR that had gone to the street at the peaceful revolution 30 years ago. In the autumn 1989, courageous citizens had brought the then DDR regime into the wack, Merkel said at a festival of Thüringer CDU Group on the next day of the German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor, among other things, reminded the occupation of the Stasi-Zentrale. "The state security was taken the shock," she said.
Musk is pursuing delivery record
The Teslas Quartal may keep records available. Despite the delivery tree there were last losses in the electric car group.
New York.Thesla-Chef Elon Musk has given its electric car companies with the view of new record numbers strong drive at the stock. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100.000 deliverys," wrote Musk in an e-mail published by the "Electrek" industry blog to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge is to bring cars quickly to the public. To this end Tesla must offer as many resources as possible.
The investors enjoyed that Teslas shares went out of trading with a Plus of more than six percent. The course has not been allowed for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 55.000 cars and thus reached its best value before.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, it is necessary to produce six-digit figures in the current and coming quarter years. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here are the profit margins low. Despite the tree there were last losses.
Puzzle solved: We can't knit ourselves
A kind of Bremse in the Greathirn prevents people from knitting themselves. This found scientists of the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments to advise how they shared on Thursday evening. It also made progress in question why children are so intensely opposed to the kitzels, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the nearness of a curtaining hand already triggers laughter before touching. This lies on a deeply lying layer in the grandhire, which already triggers the laugh during the expectation of the kettle.
According to the information, earlier researches showed that rats respond with "laugh" in the ultrasound area when they are knited by people. This "laugh" will be provided by the part of the grandhirnrind, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-consumption
Until now, the brain between self-reaching and touching can differ by others - so people cannot be able to knock themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found the experiments to the rats that the laughs of the area of the Greathirnrine concerned are suppressed during self-reaching. This is also the case when living systems were put themselves. During the xenophobian, the scientists have been able to laughen the activity in the brain and the impulse.
However, passing the self-controduction and touch by others at the same time, the laugh was also impressed. This suggested that the brain of the rat could not differ between the self-reportment and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that the people could not knit themselves because the self-reportment activates a brake in the greathire.
The rats were also trained to knit themselves, and they broke this initiation in the experiment, therefore sometimes prematurely, showed escape or fearfulness. This ambitiousness is equal to the behaviour of the children. The ambitiousness of the kitzeln is a reaction of conduct in rats and humans.
disaster used: Great fire deleted in French chemical work
The big fire in a very dangerous chemical work in the northern French city of Rouen is deleted. This was the prefecture of the Normandie of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire was broken out to Thursday at night.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances should have occurred. The samples taken do not give any reason for disturbance, as Prefekt Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. Not injured was no one. The fire war was used with about 200 vehicles.
Schools and children's gardens were closed
Inhabitors were called not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evakuated, schools and children's gardens were closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to Lubrizol company of US-Milliardary Warren Buffett
In the chemical work at the base of the Seine, additives are produced for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol from US-Milliard Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict security records. In the work, around 400 people work.
The chemical factory was already in the past for headlines - approximately when the gas methanthiol was developed by a leak in 2013 and the environment was far-reaching according to foul eggs. In 2015, after an operational accident, about 2000 litres of mineral oil fled into the city's wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his sister

The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country from the EU on 31 October without agreements, Brussels should not let its requests for amendments to the Brexit Agreement, but it is unclear.
About Cox, which had been used for the United Kingdom stay in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's thinking and to one another, would be to complete the EU's entry." Cox was murdered by a legal ekremist in 2016 during the referendum war.
Mahnmal for attacks by Oslo and Utöya is revealed

Iran releases British tanker
The UN General Debate did not solve the Iran conflict, but now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" was able to resume in the sea in Iran. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of the Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has been held in international waters since mid July in the road of Hormus in Iran. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship was on the way to Dubai, as Stena Bulk was told.
The "Stena Impero" left the harbour of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now driving for medical research to Dubai, explains Reederei head Erik Hånell. At the afternoon the ship left the Iranian waters. "But it's over," he said Swedish television broadcast SVT.
The London Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the determination of the ship illegally. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain the ship and the international law," said one release on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionsgarden had already been released to Tanker on 19 July under the preface of dismissing the laws of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in the beginning of September. 16 Crew members are right to say Hånell. They would have acted professionally in the face of the difficult and exciting situation in the past ten weeks. Reaching has now worked to bring them together quickly again with their families.
The British government suggested that the "Stena Impero" had been responded to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: there was a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was intended to have been intended for Syria, to the chain, and that the delivery was due to the authorities against EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The ship had received the British from the United States.
The Iran talked about "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Mutual measurements, it has been a dew business to release the "Stena Impero", which returned to London vehement.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped by the sea. The voltages in the region had intensified over the last months. The trade ship was taken into the conflict between the United States and Iran. It came to several interferences with tanks and drones.
According to the tensions between Teheran and Washington, the nuclear conflict of both countries. The Americans are proposing Iran's leadership to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the U.S. were out of the international Atomic Agreement, which would prevent Iran' construction of an atomic bomb and, at the same time, the political and economic isolation of it. Since then, the U.S. government forced the leadership in Teheran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a more stringent and other enlarged agreements. Iran has been resisting the pressure until now.
As a result of the dispute about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tanks in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the USA are working on a coalition for military protection of trade vessels in the region.
The Irish President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the road of Hormus at the UN Vocal Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the security of the ship in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protection.
India is ensuring a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would, in fact, predestinate the "crisis winner". In view of the criminal duties that US President Donald Trump is related to Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to rediscover. Financial heads of Asian firms who consider to relocate their production from China into another country, India calls in a survey of UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This has not only to do with the inconveniences of Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers and a single market of 1,3 billion consumers India seems to have a major role in the global production chain.
But now India is self focused in Trump's own. From the Huedegen in the Wissen House, devaluated as "Königreich der Zölle", America has distributed the trade grants for 2000 products in the early June. India prohibitively high duties and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobiles, spirits, motorcycles and others more.
In addition, the world's largest democracy also represents the security policy brilles. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's power claims in the South India Ocean. Before this background, a salve of American criminal duties against India may be considered unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Mode, which has just arrived a second five-year term, could therefore be in security.
However, the problem is on another location: the empirical heavier These that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult stand in India in the Socialist Republic of India. It is also under modes. It is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic errors that are all too long for entrepreneuric spirits. Companies now receive fast construction permits for buildings. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more stringent insolvency and conservation law create conditions to make it easier to liquidate companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant Rankings. In India, in the first five mode years, economic optics have used much to improve. However, the trade policy does not apply. In this regard, the national conservative government has made new barriers to protect internationally little competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, modes depend on the Nimbus of the energic reformer who renewed its country radically. This impression is not last due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister is only too well aware of what vocabulary western managers like it. In the core, the India First Advocate never returned from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies to be forced to endure anachronic processes and thus fit to global competition. Business, which survived thanks to the discharge of their industries, are among the tribe of modes nationalist Bharatiya Janata party and clarify these short-sight policy.
Translation by Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris

Wear the competitor into the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the lightathletic WM
The world's tip was long on the end of the time, when in the down-down Khalifa International Stadion, the men began to fall dangerously. In the first passage of the men, Jonathan Busby began to swallow from Aruba. He could hardly keep 300 meters before the target, drove into uncovered attitude, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the west African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly undergone him and supported the last half of the stadium round in the target. The forces had been enough for both to stop the passing armband clock after the goal. As soon as the scene was not enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he quite unexpectedly moved the attention of the collected journalists. Schüchtern did not want to talk about his heroic act at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he had noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only a passionmate. And he would nevertheless only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Association. Under normal circumstances he could not start. "I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this at the evening with emphasizing - and much more intense than he had thought about it. For this heroic work will remain in memory. At the end Dabo left his competitive busby even the purpose and was voluntarily taken the last place - overall five minutes after the Ethiopier Selemon Barega, who won this course. At the end, it had nothing used, because the only busby came to the end of the world lightathletic association was just disqualified.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, arrived to create a personal best time at the WM in Doha. This was according to official data at 18:10,87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes". However, only in the training, there are no best time.
Million Masch: Egyptians are hoping for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been reinforced in the field of possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Kairos, an increased police site was observed on Friday. Several U-Bahn stations remained closed, roads around the Central Tahrir-Platz were locked.
Over the past days, the police had reinforced their road controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians had been searched partly for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds have been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, it was in Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura at protests with hundreds of participants. They have been against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic corruption and abuse. A so open protest against political leader had not been in Egypt since years. The Egyptian exile exhibitors and actress Mohammed Ali, who led the demonstrations with video bombs to Facebook, has called for today's Friday to "million marsch" on central places in the country. Ali calls a "volution" for the most young Egyptians, although he is not a "grime" because he was a subject for the army millions, but his embassies arrive.
The number of arrests related to the protests increased by two observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1.570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organisation of Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. The government did not first confirm and did not comment.
Random arrests
Many people were "wovenly arrested" because they were "to the wrong time at the wrong place", and HRW made an appeal to lawyers of law. The prerequisites against the arrests are concerned by information of their lawyers of "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Kairo, Alexandria and other cities, and searched security forces in uniform form, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW's statements, to regular passengers.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. So the government blocked in Kairo websites and online services to interfere with further protests against Sisi.
Online dealer: Shipping dealer should be able to spend retours easier
For online dealers, many packages that have been sent are lost are lost. Some 20 million retours are so on the waste, but there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to spend backed products instead of destroying them.
Although companies could not be freed from sales tax on suspensions, the Ministry stated a question of the Green-Bundestag Fraction, which reported the radio media group newspapers on Friday, but the merchants could make the market value of uncoverable returns so low that they should pay no or only little sales taxes.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg have found that the federal citizens were returning any sixth package on the Internet when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the waste. They would spend the companies after the current legal situation would cost additional money, since financial authorities rated deposits like a sales tax that then affects sales tax.
Green-Fraction Shelf Katrin Göring-Eckardt requested Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear that firms cannot evaluate products accordingly and can spend free of charge to non-profit organisations. The companies should have to be able to be punished for donation, not only for online trade, but also for other businesses from the fashionload until the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be enforced at the moment.
For industry, Banksy's work stresses "the retraining of the oldest parliamentary democracy of the world into the basic preservation of animals and tribes". From Saturday onwards the painting of Sotheby's in the British capital will be postponed until 3 October. It is estimated to be EUR 1.5 to two million.
The work was first issued in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the Southwestern Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had redesigned the painting - at the time with the original Brexit date on March 29th. On this occasion the work, which was previously called "Fragestunde" was renamed into "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The image could change the owner for a million amount.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered a hard stroke with opposition at the first meeting of the subhouse after repealing a forced break by the Supreme Court. Johnson wishes to take the brexit already moved on 31 October, not least without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interfered into the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England he painted an image that represents a man who is a star of the flag of Europe. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day at the entry to the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a sport in the park
The strong verbal attacks of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-Songers in the Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. In comparison to the election campaign before the Brexit-Referendum 2016, the current controversy is a "speaking in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy this. We will come out (from the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past days and, among other things, "adjusted" to the people. At the same time, he was able to put the Members into danger because they could become a target of murder, he did as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to re-establish should be if the Members would finally respect the British decision for an EU exit, and it would not be surprising that people have been exhibited that Britain had still not been released from the EU three years after the referendum.
On Friday, even the Bishops of the Anglican Church called for retaining. "We should talk to each other with respect," said one statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's President Khan calls on Uno-incidence in Kaschmir
With an emotional appell, Pakistan's President Imran Khan once again asked the United Nations to intervene in the Kaschmir conflict with his first appearance before the Uno-Voll Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India was likely to be, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General Debate in New York. "If this is bad, you hope to be the best, but are prepared for the worst". The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kaschmir. "You should have prevented this".
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence of British colonial rule in 1947, two of them to the divided region of Kaschmir. Both atomic powers ruled a part of Kaschmir, a further part of China. At the beginning of August India had deprived the autonomy status of India and thus increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demons in Kairo call for the Sturz of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government responds with hard hands. It is strong munition to the population, over 2000 assembled in prisons to the 60.000 political prisoners who are already in place. Protesting has never been about. However, since the power acquisition of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparat has done everything to avoid a scenario like at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests was the bad economic situation in 2011. poverty, perspektiv imperfection and the feeling of being dispatched by your own government has driven millions to the street. And this is a problem that does not get the regime of el-Sisi, regardless of how hard it is against opposers. The situation has even deteriorated.
Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its values, the inflation rate is 10 percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he has financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or military. The latter is not only responsible for suppression but also for the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stations, produces food and much more. This was already before el-Sisi. With autorithic regimes, the Egyptian people has much experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critical, if large parts of the population have difficulty to afford a bottle of water.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No more "Showstopper" for capital airports
Two months have been examined whether the complex plant bolt works in the BER fire protection in the game. The operators are satisfied with the course, but the Tüv is not yet done on the BER.
After large tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is safe, said Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport Chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful trial but also said that it was still lacking in the terminal. "We have many detail themes, but we have not a real show stopper." He assured that the timetable until the operation was still buffer.
However, there are evidence that the time reserve should no longer be too large, and the construction indicator is now intended to be submitted at the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year that was intended for this autumn.
Hundreds of power cables are still to be fixed; Tüv still wants to check them until February. "To create the conditions for acquisition of the airline, it must continue to work intensively in the processing of defects," said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said, in many cases there is missing evidence, less about new cables. There is still no release for all duels on which the cables hang. The head of the airport expects that they are up to date.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the railway station under the terminal is not yet satisfactory. The problems had led the project to another crisis for three years ago. This time it is about smoking screws that run down at a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread out and it is too far down. 36 engines have to be exchanged, and then it is to give new attempts with heat gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further tree falsifications and planning errors have failed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should take into operation in 2011. The cost has risen from two billions since the beginning of 2006 to an estimated EUR 6.5 billion for opening in the next year.
As the passenger numbers have risen in Berlin at the same time, the responsibilities plan to develop the airport. Therefore, at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, the President Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is looking for two new directors. Finance Chief Heike Fölster switches to the German railway at the end of the year, Personal Chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen goes to Rente next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. They put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Automaten for Drugs - police arrested man
He needed money for drugs - and for this he hunted some automations in the Chemnitz city area! Now the deceaser finally sits in prison!
Over the past two years, the number of smelled cigarette and parking certificate automats in Chemnitz and the region has risen strongly. A million damage was created!
After two detonations, the police was at the end of May on the civil road and on the further road in Chemnitz, a 33-year-old German.
Police speaker Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of investigations due to the introduction of explosives in fact, with particularly difficult case of the thief steel led by the Chemnitz Kriminal Police, not only confirmed this suspicion against the 33-year-old."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old chemnitzer was now totally eight actions.
The police speaker: "With the prudent he funded his deceptive dependency," only four times the bomber had sprinkled on the civil road between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage is based on at least 60 000 euros!
The Automate bomber now sits in investigation, the police investigations against him continue.
Think that he was also responsible for further automated talks in Chemnitz and neighbouring districts.
AUA takes Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group embraces its strategy for the airport of Vienna. In the midst of the price campaign with cheap flyers such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA accepts "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday a press speaker of Austrian airlines compared to the APA. Before, "AviationNetOnline" reported on it.
The Vienna Base of the Airhansa Bilanzflieger Eurowings is thus dissolved de facto. From the current seven Eurowings flights, four airplanes remain in Vienna. They will take AUA from the year 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings-Person. In Salzburg, three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed, which are supposed to fly as Charter Machines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany are taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings Base in Vienna is integrated into the AUA turn cross and the network planning, said the speaker. The flight times are to be voted on connecting flights. On the one hand, it is aimed to strengthen the wind cross and, on the other hand, develop the decentral transport from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, the Eurowings in Vienna only serve as the "Production Company" for the Group's Switzer AUA. In particular, Barcelona and Rome would be used with AUA flight number, but mostly with Eurowings device. The board products should be adapted to that by Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight leaders are from Eurowings. The Eurowings flight number starting under AUA flight number will not be made in terminal 1, but as the AUA is manufactured in the terminal 3.
The Ryanair-Tochter Laudamotion announced only on Thursday to increase the fleet in Vienna next summer to 16 aircraft. The Irish Billigflieger sent four Ryanair-Maschines to Vienna as well as in the so-called "Wetlease", which criticized the trade union as a navigation structure to the Collektiv Convention.
The warrant of Ryanair-Chef Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overridden the AUA in five years, escaped on Friday AUA Board Andreas Otto: "We stay the number one at location, in five, six or ten years".

Study on causes of heart diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes a heart weakness or an infarkt? Hamburger researchers want to see the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people exactly.
As regards the analysis of the 9000 people’s heritage, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to draw more detailed attention to the causes of cardiac diseases.
The research project is the largest of this type in the German area, and the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) shared on Friday. The Cohne Foundation promotes the project with 12,5 million euros. From Switzerland, the high mountainsklinik Davos, belonging to the Foundation, and the University Hospital of Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smokes and unhealthy food include the essential impactable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors indicate the risk. However, the merger between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it has been said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with the 1000 former patients of the Universitarian Heart and Vegetation Center at UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of about 20.000 relevant human genes, possible disease-saving changes in DNA - so-called mutations - were known, it was from the clinic. Every year some 200 would be added.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the precaution, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weaknesses and heart infarcts. The data may also be useful in the research of other national diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the Universitary heart and vessel centre. New knowledge about the merger between heart and brain, heart and kidneys and cancer diseases are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is the strong will to use the data for the research of other diseases. The Clinic of the Foundation in Davos treats mainly allergies. Now, at the therein, he should be a centre for Cardiovascular precision medicine and is created a professor for bioinformatics. In reasoning his commitment, the logistic operator living in Switzerland said that he had been operated at the open heart in Hamburg for three years ago and very grateful.
The biological samples of the healthy participants come from Hamburger, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". This is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 probands, which, according to the clinic of the clinic, is the largest local health study in the world. It is strictly respected for the protection of the anonymousised data. The scientists assured a Petabyte (1000 Terabyte) to data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital of Zurich.
Today, according to UKE, the earthquake of a human being can be unencrypted within 24 hours. The pure cost of this is 1300 euros. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results have been published in 2001, has cost more than one hundred million euros. The study is supposed to begin on 1 October, at the end of 2020, all 9000 samples should be analyzed. The first results will be expected in this year.
Nigerian police liberated hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, more than 300 tortured and abused boys have been released from a Coran School. According to inhabitors, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims of the fewer years, as police speaker Yakubu Sabo told. "The victims were abused. Some of them gave them to have been raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys had been held under the predominantly to be informed in the Coran and "provided" in fact. In fact, the skilled ones were held by their teachers under "disrespected and most inhumane conditions", Sabo said. Some hundred students, including children aged nine years, were chained in a small room.
The Coran School has been aware of the information for about ten years. Individuals had made the authorities aware of repeated irregularities in the establishment. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Coran School, Sabo said. They were not inclined by the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In most of the Muslim North Nigerias there are many private coran schools. They replace the often lack of state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to the UN refugee aid, more than 400,000 people have fled over the border in the neighbouring state of Niger.
Chained and foltered: Nigeria’s police released 400 children from school
At a school in the north of Nigeria almost 400 students have freed from distressful relationships. "Many of them were chained and some of them had visible injuries that embraced to folter," said Police speaker Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after an indication at a Islamic school. The conditions there were "human unworthy" and the officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the release action.
The children, all together with boys, were held on their school like slaves and placed in chains. Some were sexually abused. TV pictures showed awaited and injured students in a recognized bad health condition.
World Football Chooser: Further Prosecutions to Messia and Klopps Kür
Signing football invalid
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa characterizes the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. It is the sixth honor and record for Lionel Messi.
After Nicaragua's captain stated that he had never voted at the World Football Wahl, from other countries it comes to the Fifa. Egypt was not appreciated – with a curious reasoning.
Many of the Fifa has proven to be an inclination in recent years: the WM agreements, dubiosis plans of their president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functionary. However, the Fifa world-football Wahl did not suspect to run unclearly - if it fails that the voice-authorised national trainers and national teamships of the member associations often more frequently according to sympathy than according to objective assessment.
But after already Nicaragua's captain had accused that he had not voted at all, there are further inconveniences now: Egypt accused that the voices of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact they do not arise in the official and publicly agreed voting.
The Fifa excuses the fact that "the signatures on the voting forms were issued in uppercases and therefore not valid" were. They contacted the Egyptian association several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's trainer also surprised
In the case of Egypt, the Sudanian association indicates that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi at place, Virgil van Dijk on three and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote had been taken as well, with signatures and official stimulus of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera also had raised an exhortation: "Do not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details about my voice are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, the nicaraguan football association was expected to have just voted in his name.
From the association now came the message on Friday: Vote, but of course was no intention. The filled voting documents were "infringably" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the nicaraguanian selection, said it was in a communication of the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had chosen. "We take the responsibility for the administrative error," said the Communication. Both Rosas as well as the team trainer Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "as it stands in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases, in an investigation, the Fifa is now being examined, but emphasised that the election process was externally monitored by the consultative company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. So long Lionel Messi remains unrestricted winners of the World Football Wahl and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine affairs: Ranghohe Republicaner speaks for official investigation
Two ribhohe Republicans have openly expressed themselves for an official investigation against the U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important", said the Republican governor of the United States of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are detected". He wants to know more about the Whistleblower-Affäre before taking action. A impeachment procedure can lead to the president.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the enthusiasm, which showed that Trump had repeatedly asked the Ukraine President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to examine the activities of the democratic President and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have not yet been able to recognise with criticism to Trump because of the whistleblower affairs, but few have not been able to detect this. Scott’s statements are now a first sign in Trump's Party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already applied several times against Trump's policy, such as against the reluctance of environmental legislation and the enlargement of immigration legislation.
As a further rankhearted Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, said for the investigation. "It is a deeply distorting situation," said Baker. "The right approach and the responsibility for the convention is now to examine the matter and go to her foresee."
At the same time, Scott and Baker, as governor of the U.S. States, have not formally spoken about the procedure against Trump, which is decided in the convention. Therefore, their statements are particularly symbolically important. Nevertheless, first Senators of the Republicans have criticized about the situation. In the midst of Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, too deeply disturbing".
In the opening of a procedure against Trump, the democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation in the opening of an office survey, for the purpose of foreign influence on their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the procedure of the Office. With its majority of the representatives' house, the democrats could seek a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on actual office survey falls in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low, so no U.S. President has yet been dispensed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Waren Folter at Board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they should have raped and murdered in libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had been charged the harbour of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Lybian refugees on board. After heavily protests and international criticism - also by Austria’s Federal President Alexander van der Bellen -, her home arrest was restored by an Italian judge after a few days.
Now, new severe presumpts against rackete are hard. So three men, who have been suspended torture in Libyan refugee camps with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been taken into an Aufnahme camp in Messina (Sicily), after migrants had re-equipped their peans in Italy. "We can not exclude this, but have no guaranteed information about it even," said "Sea Watch-sprecher Ruben Neugebauer der Deutschen Presse-Agentur.
The police stated in mid-September that the suspects were raped in the North African country, wrestled and even murdered. Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically scooped and aborted Gräueltates - by repeated and constant physical violence," said it was in the communication.
NGO and aid organisations now point out that they can't know exactly who's on the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. The people come without passes," said Neugebauer. Folter is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. Therefore, it’s likely that even taters are on the ships. "It is therefore very important that it is going to be followed."
Italy Minister of Justice Matteo Salvini called for an excuse against which aid is still established in Italy for illegal immigration.
Musk is pursuing delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given its electric car group with the view of new record numbers strong drive on the stock.
"We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100.000 exhibits," wrote Musk in a e-mail published by the "Electrek" industry blog to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge is to bring cars quickly to the public. To this end Tesla must offer as many resources as possible.
The investors enjoyed that: Teslas shares went out of trade with a Plus of more than six percent. So strong the course has no longer been assigned for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95.000 cars and thus reached its best value before.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. In the current and coming quarter years, he has to return six-digit figures. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here are the profit margins low. Despite the tree there were last losses.
US Budget dispute: Only one bridge financing
The new budget year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a budget, and the Senate is followed by the representative house on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed on an increase in expenditure limits for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States have once again agreed before the new fishing year starting on 1 October. The Senate followed the representative house on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing (continuing resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would come to a Shutdown on Monday at midnight, a part-session of the Federal Administration.
Shutdown Used
The Federal Administration will now be funded at the level and in view of the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year of Monday 2019. This is because the Congress does not have time on the 12 expenditure laws, which can be assigned to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year of 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the representative house, but the expenditure law reflects priorities of the Democrats, which are hardly dominated by the Republicans. The Senate also returned to ten of the twelve expenditure plans, which are hardly able to dominate.
In the Senat, the Republicans apparently try to force 12 billion dollars for wall construction, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The democrats are stirring at the walls' construction plans and their financing, which is actually planned for other military constructions and projects. The dispute on the wall was already scaled in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
The spirits separate on the walls
At present, it is unclear how the parties wish to draw close to this question. Probably more than an agreement to all 12 expenditure laws in the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional financing is beyond 21 November.
Before the background of the continuing inability of the convention, the 12 expenditure laws to some, and the risk of a Shutdown gaining ideas for the automation of the process to popularity. Template S. 1877 for the avoidance of Shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would automatically continue to the previous level of year, stop the travel activities of Parliamentarians and keep their wages back until the new annual expenditure plans are required.
France allows artificial fertilization for readers and singles
In France, the artificial fertilization of women and readers is intended to be open in the future: the Paris National Assembly agreed with a large majority of the government's laws for which all women can use an in-Vitro fertilisation, which will allow the demand for an anonymous seed dispenser.
The template still needs the consent of the Senat. In the three-day emotional debate, critics had warned in the right camp that many children could grow up without father in the future. The French Bishops conference is also against the newization.
The new arrangement is the core component of a bioethics company, the Minister for Health Agnès Buzyn defended as a "Chance" for society. It presents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their idea, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women should be carried by social insurance.
Prohibited further fertilization with sperm of dead husband
The National Assembly, on the other hand, returned a amendment to the widows to provide a artificial fertilizer access to the sperm of her dead man. In Belgium, Spain and Britain, the artificial fertilization "post-mortem" is allowed. In Germany there were cases in the past, in which women forgottenly complained to the loss of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the prevention in Paris argued that a so-proved child would then be "a very heavy fate".
Many Members of the Government Party La République en Marche (The Republic of Move, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and Members of the Opposition, on the other hand, expressed themselves for the artificial moisture with the sperm of the dead partner. They stressed that a widow would be a "double grief" when their husband died even unfilled by their children.
The initiativers of the missing amendment believe that a widow can befreshed in the future with the sperm of a unknown, but not with its own partner.
So far, the artificial fertilization in France is allowed only iterosexual couples who cannot witness children. They must be married or live together at least two years. Buzyn has already announced in summer that the body's mothership continues to remain prohibited.
In Germany, the artificial fertilization of all women is open - for single or lesbian couples it is often difficult.
Compensation for climate: Calls according to air fare for union are louder
At the universities there is a lot of fleeing, so the country is going to have a climate charge in the future, and the receipts say that they would not have any money for it, but now they are also internally under pressure.

The challenging discussion on a climate delegation to flights from universities and universities comes back to swallow. After the National Rectors Conference had skeptically responded to an appropriate prevention from the green-swere coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctors of six bath-wiertemberg universities and a paedagogical universities for a compensation of service flights are now being "decisively necessary" at the same time a wide debate on the avoidability of flights, says it in their opinion. The original cabinet decision is now on ice because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia takes up North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB Secret Service, the arrested illegally fed in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. At that time there was a shooting change between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fishermen later lamented his severe injuries. This time, however, there was no injured.
The Communist North Korea suffers under chronic food shortage, and the North Korean fishermen were on the road to Russian high-speed waters. There, Russia's coastal wake, according to its own information on the protection of their multies biological resources, patroles.
30.000 ink fish taken
In the renewed checks, 300,000 ink fish were discovered and occupied on the boats. In addition, the data of three fishermen and two motor boats were taken and postioned to Nachodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok.
Russia’s fishing authorities did not issue fishing licences to the North Koreans this year after complaints of local entrepreneurs. According to thousands of fishermen from North Korea, media have already been arrested in the present year.
The Chief of the Association of Russian Fisheries in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained high environmental damages by the North Korean fishermen. They fought with the close synthetic networks in Russia. These would also remove small liveries from the sea. In addition, the networks would simply dispose on the sea where they needed 200 years to be displaced.
Only 18,000 days: US reduce asylum upper limit from
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with chosen police representatives in the White House.
The most rich country of the earth is shooting against protective seekers: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the limit for the legal increase of refugees will continue to be reduced.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the historically low limit for the adoption of new refugees. In the 2020 economic year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, the limit is to be left to the country by a maximum of 18,000 people, as the US Ministry stated. In the almost expiry economic year, the limit is still at 30.000 people.
In recent years, the Government of President Donald Trump has dramatically reduced the receipt of protective seekers from all over the world, and under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, much higher recording limits had been made.
The target of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the United States as the most "barmative and generous nation in history", a formulation which reminiscently reminds the use of the language of the most renowned US President.
An "responsively responsibly handling" with refugees aimed at returning to their home countries in order to help rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he has a lot of appeal from followers, but there is also enormous criticism.
In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump has depended on the national state of emergency. Whether there is a contemporary link between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the U.S. headquarters is uncler. Trump is currently under pressure because of Selenskyj affairs and a potentially threatening deduction procedure.
The U.S. government will concentrate on the adoption of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraq who have helped the US military in the country and are thus threatened by the interpretation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, should be taken up to a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The United States want to achieve that people from this "nortal triangle" of Central America apply asylum in other countries. Before this background, the United States have only closed Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to embrace migration at the US-South border to Mexico.
Court orders release from Orang-Utan from Zoo
A Orang-Utan-Weibchen has been moved to a suspension station for human aviation in the United States in 1986, which was born in the Rostock Zoo, "Sandra" was spoken to the rights of a "non-humanic person", so its release was forced. The animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the freight room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human effin is not able to adapt to the life in the wilderness, it is supposed to live in the release of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are 21 further Orang-Utans and 31 Simpansen, among them "Bubbles", once the pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before the entry into Florida, there has to be a 40-day quaranty in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the United States of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, Sandra spent some years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process investigated by animal protection has contributed to Sandras' fundamental rights in 2014 to the Zoo of Buenos Aires to an ecopark. Until 2023, there is a research and educational site to maintain the variety of species.
Record for Swiss Extrembergsteiger: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Dani Arnold, the extreme mountain climber, has succeeded in a new Husare Ride on the almost 3000 meters of the Great Zinn in the Italian Alps.
Without network, double soil or other means of aid, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Zinn in a new record time.
Clothed with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supported the absolute free Schwindel required Arnold 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise, so that he undermined the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in Free Soolo Speed at four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sporting product manufacturer Nike has made a significant profit rate. The net profit increased to $1.4 billion (napp 1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than the previous year, as the group said on Tuesday. This is the main reason that the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", which directly turns to its customers directly.

Financing head Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to advance the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer and thus develop its advantage of competition. The investors responded pleased to the quarterly numbers - the shares of the sporting product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadion Prohibition for Rassism in Italy
Because of racist comments about soccer profi Juan Jesus by AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has been subject to a life-long stage ban against a fan. The defender of the Brazilians Jesus was impressed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and called on his club to take action.

generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcisstic, the generation Z is political - whole year courses are taken into consideration. See more precisely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective life feeling of young people?
"The Krabben are coming!" On 21 September, the crab at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun started officially, with the opening event of the 19th of China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as it was known to the Department of Public Working of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, who forms the southern runner of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent of mountains, 20 percent of water areas and 50 percent of fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
In the beginning of the 1990s, people in Gaochun have already begun with crabs. During the time, the Krabben industry has developed into a pregnant industry that ensured high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively engaged in a large, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as a technically supported crawling. And the city has funded the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has developed a reform to the "distribution of power, optimization of administration and authorities" and, with care, the service network for "acceptions under a roof, a team for criminal prosecution, a network for services, a platform for credit provision", designed to optimise the city's environment for authorisations, services and development.
Gaochun fully utilizes the advantages given locally by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and utilizes the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as an extension painting to intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedicine and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector, as well as farms for ecological agriculture which are leading in the "3+2" area, while Gaochun promoted the construction of a national, all areas of widespread tourism zones and foreign transport locations of national importance. Here, the ecological and cultural resources of the landscape of Gaochun were integrated, the condition of the buildings for civil services and the public service, the areas "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" further developed and the development of cultural tourism on high quality level.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
After his return from the UN Vocational Assembly, the Irish President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged offer of the United States to repeal sanctions. The United States had in contrast to talk with the Teheran leadership a end to all sanctions, Ruhani explained on his official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian official about Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift up the sanctions linked to him so that there is a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York, and had failed to find a meeting. "And America says that I've raised the sanctions," supplemented Ruhani. The kind of criminal measures that were to be completed have been held to debate." And they clearly said that we have all sanctions.
However, this prevention would not take place in a acceptable way, criticized Ruhani. Given the current criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with the Iran with Russia and China. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron had, like Merkel at the edge of the UN Vocal Assembly, the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Gravity Earthquake near Istanbul - nearly 200 legs
After the western Turkey was shot by two earthquakes within the shortest time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the day before, there have been almost 200 afterbeams, the Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. Thus, the concern for a disaster is growing.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons, and hundreds of buildings have been damaged, and the earthquake of strength 5.8 had been shaken by the Marmara region before Istanbul and dissolved panic in the million metropole. Now, the government wants to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Octay announced.
During the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for occupies, Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the loose danger will be ignored again. Every year, poorly built homes, including those of the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City Planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning that large open areas in the centre have been built long. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük-Beben in August, Istanbul's construction chamber had warned that estimated a million buildings in Istanbul were not incurable.
The Epicentre of the Beben of Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometers of depth, as the disaster protection authority Afad told. A smaller rebeat would provide even larger panic on the streets.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu shared on Twitter, infringements or damages were not reported at first. State-sender TRT showed people who ran panic from the houses. Students were brought out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for security reasons. Some students wounded how to see images.
Istanbul is considered to be a particular danger of earthquake. Under the Marmara Sea, a section of the so-called North-Anatolic disorder that marks the border between the eurasian and the anatolian earthquake. Turkey is always shaken by earthquakes. One of the most fatal was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbuls. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that a earthquake of strength could threaten 7.1 to 7.4, but when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. On Thursday, the earthquake has already met the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies devote emergency plans, private people have so-called Go-Bags with everything necessary packed right next to doors, and schools help children how to do when the earth wacks. When the next big beat comes, be unclear.
The Turkish president Recep Tayip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were injured. Some buildings had suffered light damage. The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul disaster coordination centre (Acom). According to its information, two minarettes of mosques crashed in the districts Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of postbeaming in Istanbul
In social networks many users report panic. Buildings were wacked. Schools and hospitals have been evakuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It was stronger than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of Turkish Red Halfmond, Kerem Klinik, warned by Twitter from the post. He called the people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The date of the occupation is indicated by the official date at 13.59 p.m. (local time) and only a few minutes after the first occupation, according to CNN Turkey, there was an afterbeam specified with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
First on Tuesday, a earthquake of the strength 4.6 has shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to feel until Istanbul. His epicentric centre was located west of the million metropole in the Marmara Sea, and Afad was already informed on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provides headlines on this Tuesday: Pakistan was also affected by a heavy earthquake.
Researchers assume that it could come to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul before or later - the tension between the tektonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will be discharged and mass damage will cause them.
Earthquake researcher Süku Ersoy calculates that the earthquake is now a warning. It would be more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "This might be the signs of a larger earthquake," said Ersoy to the sender. "For or afterwards, the great earthquake will come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the beat also got out of Istanbul. In Albania, there had been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injuries. Also on the ground lake the earth had been bored this year.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine
Two bririous documents provide for new petty in Ukraine's affairs for possible power abuse by US President Donald Trump. U.S. democrats are strengthened by the US democrats: The complaint submitted by an anonymous instructor about Trump and its controversial phoneship with the Ukraine President mountains are important significance points of investigation against the presidents. Trump itself looks more than victims of a "Hexenjagd".
USA: United Airlines air gas locked in toilet - Flyer redirected
As a passenger was locked into the board toilette, a flight from United Airlines has been redirected. The toilet tour was blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the Airline reported that the US-Medien.
At an explanatory interlanding on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the close cabin. At about an hour she had been imprisoned in it, US-Medien wrote to other passengers. To continue flight towards San Francisco, the passengers had to switch the machine.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which according to US media of flight 1554, is to see how several people try to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, Ma'am. We soon get you out, OK?" says a man. The airline has excused all the passengers. The first time the woman was to get a compensation.
The Cakerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is uncertain.
Inspirated by Franz Kafkas, the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Cakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on 27 November, the Diogenee Verlag (Zürich) shared. In this, it is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or gehazed in his former life, but now is the most powerful man of Britain. He sees it as his mission to actually implement the people's will and is wildly determined to leave themselves from nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When the Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers are shamelessly lying like once the Soviet leaders, if Brexiteers in high positions have to make the disaster of a no deal right away - then a writer has to ask what he can do. There is only an answer to it: write it". By McEwan was only published in the spring of the novel "Maschines like I" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas 1915 first published story is made by Gregor Samsa, who awaits one morning and looks "to be transformed into an unleavened ignorant" after and after family and society. "Ian McEwan is inclined by cafka to describe a world that stands the head," said Diogene's publisher.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 carons in Austria and Hungary receive flight brakes in order to reduce noise burden by freight trains. Furthermore, sections of railway connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna's New Town and Sopron are modernized and elektrified.
This is intended to make more comfortable travel from the EU authorities and reduce CO2 emissions, which come from the EU Infrastructure Summit "Connect Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels until 31 October
The German travel organiser Thomas Cook has resigned all the trips until 31 October 2019 after his insolvency contract. Travel could not be entered "for insolvency reasons," the company informed on Thursday evening.
These were also affected by bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Bookers Travel and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As it is about traveling from 1 November 2019, the company was released. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further approach was examined.
Thomas Cook in Germany was advised in the sole of the British mother group's pledge and had launched insolvency on Wednesday. The company, among others Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bookers, has occupied about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels immediately again money
However, since this Friday hotels in the abroad, which are still hosting Thomas-Cook-Urlaubers, will receive money from Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are, according to Zurich, linked to the condition that holidays are no longer invited to pay extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and no separate accounts, hotels in the holiday locations are now to receive 50 percent of the outgoing payments, as a Zurich-Sprecher of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and under the prerequisite that Thomas-Cook-Reisende from these hotels from immediately to be invited or otherwise required for individual payment of hotel accounts", said Sprecher Bernd Engelien.
Insurance responded to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their own accommodation on site. Some had to put over 1000 euros on the table, and the German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had so much criticized this.
As many hotels are affected, on Friday the insolvent travel provider will vote, the insurance producer said. According to information from Thursday, there were still 70 000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschalurlauber from Germany. The Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return of the Thomas-Cook-customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels through Zurich will only help the travelers who are still on the road. For Thomas-Cook guests who are still trying to fly on the holiday, it looks bad. On late Thursday evening, the company shared all the travels until 31 October, which would also be paid for those bookings which have already been paid.
As it was about traveling from 1 November 2019, the company was released. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further approach was examined, and in principle the insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform the Kaera website about the possibilities of repayment of the travel price and apply their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys Sprengmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry continues the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he is now walking directly on the tracks of his mother.
With a blue splitter protectionwest, the British prince Harry has sung and destroyed a spray mine in Angola.
During a camp of the British Halo Trust at Dirico's place, he produced the tv cameras running on Friday morning. In the safe distance, the sprays exploded in the Savann landscape without harm. Although only the Halo Trust has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the century’s bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mine fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African trip, Harry wanted to walk directly to the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same speaker, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to relocate the way she went to. The pictures on which princess Diana went through a clear mine field in 1997 were about the world. She also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, starting in the South African tourist metropole Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a No deal remains acute
In fact, Premier Boris Johnson had clearly stated: it will give a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements are already made by the polarizing Britain of eternal duration. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Britain shifts like a damocloth value over the blondop. His suspension of the Parliament to be able to perform its Brexit course until the date of entry, was aborted at the beginning of this week, and a law adopted by the Parliament is obliged to bring to an extension of bilateral discussions with the EU until 31 October, but that has always excluded Johnson.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass on Johnson. In the meantime, he made a hospital remedy that he supports an extension of the negotiations in the event of non-enterprise until the end of October:
You know, we'll keep the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU to 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm careful optimistic that this works.
And the time, the Brexit dealer in Brussels gradually runs out of it. The EU and the British entrepreneurs have still been able to prevent an exit from Britain from the European Union without agreements, but the recent discussions have not reached any breakout again. A agreement until the end of October appears rather difficult. The British Prime Ministers are not currently able to make the law again shift the date of entry. The opposition is trading with the words of the Prime Minister but does not. It fears that Johnson could actually pass through the Brexit in the case of a no deals.
U.S. members: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. In the meantime, there have been confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the U.S. Health Authority's CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were already more than 900 people affected, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lungs damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lungs damage has been known. The complaints appear to be restricted to users in the United States.
The fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. Construction entrepreneurs and actressors in Spain call for a "Volksrevolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military whose critics are corruption and abuses. Ali hopes that mass communications with a million participants in central places of the country.
In any case, security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Kairos was already a stronger police site. Several U-Bahn stations stayed closed, roads around the central Tahrir-Platz were locked. In recent days, the police had reinforced their road controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrations also gathered around the Tahrir-Platz.
During the last weekend, Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura came to protests with hundreds of participants. A so open protest had not been made in Egypt for years. According to this, security forces responded. According to the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were randomly arrested - only because they were "to the wrong time at the wrong place", HRW was participating on lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. So the government blocked in Kairo websites and online services to interfere with further protests against al-Sisi. The general ruled the country since 2013, after he had crashed the democraticly chosen Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands Islamists, government winners, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially sentenced in the past years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
On Friday, Arved Fuchs was returned from his Greenland Expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg Harbour, among other things, by the Skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had examined and documented the consequences of warming in the coastal islands and Greenland during the last few months on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen".
The Fridays for future movement are a blessing, said the polar researcher. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to report a word. It has been aware that the earth warms up. Yet many have acted as if it were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often taking place under public exclusion," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of the warming and calmness of the seas. In the expedition, among others, it was measured with a drone of greenlands galleries and fed with networks to microplastics.
For his "Campagne for Sustainable and Respectful Use of the World Seas" the Polish researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" under the Hamburg climate week. "For us all of which the survival of the Oceans is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the price distribution. "He is a witness of changes that have been made in the last decades in the Arktis."
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for nests 430 Euros
430 Euro for two tellers Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Englishburg in Rome: this seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The invoice with 80 Euro drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the exit on Facebook, which has been hot reactions.
"Solche cases are harmful of the view of Rome. We call for the police to question whether it is a fraud here," called a speaker of Federagit, the association of the travel leader in Rome, according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The response of the restaurant owners was proposed. The Japanese women had ordered not only Spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified. However, this is not to be taken from the account. Also a drinking fee of up to 20 percent of the account was normal, the guest's business.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could, after the turbulent enthusiasms in recent days, have actually been confronted with a democracy procedure, which democrats want to check this as soon as possible with their investigation at the representative house – the talk is from weeks until a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the Scandal, the calling office with the Ukraine President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is monstrous: the President has misused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an impact on the 2020 election. He has explicitly used the dependence of Ukraine to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also compulsory in the now published couple of discussion with Selenskyj, although it does not return the full text. The phone office of July 25 is only an epide of a much larger history, in which the centre of Trump, above all, is its personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
In May 2019, the history takes its beginning when the New York Times reported by Rudy Giulianis travel plans into Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the just-elected president Selenskyj, and the lawyer knows very precisely that his intentions are humiliated. "We don't mix ourselves into a choice, we mix ourselves into an investigation to which we have the right," he says the newspaper. You can think it is inappropriate, but "theran is nothing illegal". Giuliani wants us to be pursued in Ukraine investigations for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information is very helpful for my clients and can be expose as helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seemed to have infected with right conspiracy fantasy that are fixed on Trump's counterparty in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine at that time, critics said to build an occasion for Russia mediating in the United States. However, this preface was never serious to take.
The version of Giulianis and the President-in-Office: The former Vice-President and the President-in-Office of the President-in-Office of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has been the Ukraine officer of the Obama government of the former Vice-President of the Ukraine Director of the Ukraine General State Victor Schokin. Although, in order to stop the gas company's investigation in which the Supervisory Board was active his son Hunter Biden, Ukraine was financially pressed to interfere with the corrupt making of his family.
In fact, the process was quite different. When Joe Biden called for the Ukraine General State Anwalt to go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. In addition, Schokin was suspiciously suspended even to corrupt signs, the US government was not the only Western partner who urged his release. In addition, the Obama government was even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Distortions at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report enormous disorders with Instagram and Facebook. Thus, especially Germany, Britain and Spain are affected.All disorders are reported on the website.The user reports that Facebook has not loaded again since about 15.30 pm. Instagram also indicates that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disorder even if not in the same range.
Instagram and co. frequently affected by disorders
It is not the first massive accident this year. In March and July, the services were taken out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also take this time back on Twitter to make their worry air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been saved from the chilenic air weapon from the ice of Antarctica. They were traveling with a smoky boat and several miles away from their base when their engine was prohibited. They had luck in the unfortunity - less than one hour had the Chinese rescue suppressor for the mountain.
Eduardo Mosquera, Communicated door of the 4th chilenic airbrigade:
"To 9:30 p.m. we received the message just before ten we were started, and good 20 minutes spàter we were over the smoking boat."
Poland has been working on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station , 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NOT upload cablelessly
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used yet.
Since, as last, several new smartphones have come on the market, supporting cable-free charges and selling very well - all ahead of the new iPhone-11- models, we would like to call a study from early July to memory. The cable-free loading of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn before the cable-free shop of smartphones. This is, according to the knowledge of the University of Warwick, extremely harmful for the devices. Reason for this, the significantly larger heat development. If a cell phone is normally up by cable, the battery retains within three hours to 27 degrees. During cable-free charge, the researchers have measured even when perfect orientation of the smartphone on the charging path, however, always over 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is something next to the splee, the temperature rises even higher.
Capacity and lifetime
According to researchers, the temperature for battery sustainability is a crucial factor. It plays a role in each single degree. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery is not only high capacity, but it is also not even a long time in the total. The life span is lower. Therefore, the researchers recommend that the smartphone is always charged by cable. Since a battery exchange is always connected with high costs, it is likely to be a useful tip. Apple has finally increased the costs for a battery exchange even once again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely comfortable:Please put the device on a corresponding charging path - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is being installed without harsh cable salad and moodful straw. As Qi (stead for inductive energy transfer) uses a global standard, with which apple is exceptional, there are little limitations. However, technology should be applied only in exceptional case.
Everest grade Photography: 13 eighteenths in six months
A nepalesian mountain rising has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal within just six months of 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, shared his expedition organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: He is a photograph of mountain climbers that are on Mount Everest Snake.
The image of the mass-and-section was a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest peak of the earth. In May 11 climbers died during the surgery within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the order of the 14th eight thousand: at present Chinese authorities lock the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this is called bad weather. In the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to speak to China in order to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a dreamy elephant cow, a police speaker shared on Friday. "We suspected that the elephants were poisoned."
The four Kadavers were found in a protective area near the famous and many tourists who visited former rock fortress of Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old to the police speaker. It was ordered an autopsy to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers in whose country the animals had prematured harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year.
According to estimates in Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants are living, and theoretical death penalty is on their killing.
Containing British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the harbour city of Bandar Abbas for more than two months after its arrest by Iran. This gave the Seafare Office Bandar Abbas known according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Gulf had set the Tanker under the preface of the British flag under the preface to have dismissed marine laws in the Persian Gulf on 19 July.
Management by Thomas Cook in criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the Subhouse wants to examine the plenty of the traveler Thomas Cook's plenary, which is intended to take account of the accounts of the Board as well as of the question why the British government did not have financial contributions to the entrepreneur Thomas Cook. "Our interest applies to the company as well as the control by external accounting auditors," said Rachel Reeves Committee chairs in London. "Offentiblely we have to do it with a bad example of management.”
According to experts genes are overestimated in the risk of intestine cancer
The role of genes in the family's increased risk of imm cancer has seemed to have been overestimated. In this conclusion, researchers of the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg are in a current study. Other risk factors such as family habits are probably more difficult than until now. This has been the consequences for the calculations of the individual cancer risks.
Elon Musk allows Tesla Actien to rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees on Thursday (local time) from the "Electrek" sectoral blog. The demand was strong, so that Tesla 110'000 orders could be booked in Musk's newsletters.
The challenge is to bring cars quickly to the public, so Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible to the quarters.
The investors took the information: Teslas shares went out of trade with a Plus of over six percent. So strong the course has no longer been assigned for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95'000 cars and thus reached its best value before.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. In the current and coming quarter years, six-digit figures have to be achieved. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here are the profit margins low. Despite the tree there were last losses.
Will British Government Brexit-Gesetz surround? Johnson Remaining
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he looks at the possibility of Umgehung of the last law adopted by Parliament against unregulated Brexit.
The law suggests that the government must request a shift of the date of entry, no agreements with the EU should be reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as the "Capulation Act", which is difficult for negotiations with the EU.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the encouragement that Johnson could try to use "political canvas" in order to avoid the law. Johnson could set up a procedure to move the entry into force of the law to the time following the EU expiry.
Johnson said that he strived to draw up an agreement with the European Union. "We are confident that we leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to deal with an agreement."
Iran apparently drives Uran extension high
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European contract partner in the conflict with the rescue of the historic Atomic Agreement. "Leider shows the European States inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the edge of the UN Voting Assembly in New York. In case they were not promising their promises, he set out "more steps" from the 2015 agreements that were negotiated.
The background is the conflict of the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atomic bomb, which maintained the commitment to Teheran to normalise the economic relations. The United States came out of the agreement in 2018 to force Iran with "maximal pressure" to a course change in the aggressive nahost policy. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with harder editions and now retains to severe sanctions against Teheran. Iran finally responded to a reimbursement of the Uran enrichment restricted in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or prepared for use at least the beginning of September. Iran also prepares the construction of more than 300 other central lips.
Perhaps the Europeans were not ready to carry their part of the deal and therefore the Iranians left alone with the costs and the loadd US sanctions, mutanous Rohani. However, there will still be further discussions that hopefully breached a solution.
Rohani further contradicts Iran’s development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in the middle of September, Germany, France and Britain followed on Monday of the U.S. estimate that Teheran was carrying responsibility for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran had known to the attack, which was considered by the United States as a false confession. "We have nothing to do so," reaffirmed Rohani on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations should give evidence to it," said Rohani. However, the European leaders in the discussions with him during the UN General Debate would not have been able to find evidence, but instead they had only called on that the rebels couldn't carry out an attack like that in Jemen during the past days with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible discussions with US President Trump should first be repealed the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration, Rohani demanded. He urged the Government in Washington to rely on a policy of "dialog and reason".
Comet from other star through crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the deepness of the world all. This is only once before. The comet allows backing to other solar systems.
In the beginning, what was only a mutation is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of the space was baptized after its discovery to 2I/Borisov and has awakened the interest of astronomers around the world.
The most far-reached comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory - with a self-builded telescope of 65 centimeters diameter. According to observers of different observatories, not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that he was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 only the second interstellar object looking at our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get views into a foreign solar system before it disappears on recorder views. First observations show that the interstellar comet like our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of Canary. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is significantly above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," reported about Davide Farnocchia in a communication from the U.S. Space Authority Nasa.
The comet is the analysis of a so-called Hyperbelbahn that leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomy Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and catering of sky bodies. To the honour of his discovery, the interstellar sweifster, which was first led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was the name 2I/Borisov, and the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been looked at at the flight. Thus, the researchers remain many months for studies. "The object will reach the largest brightness in the middle of December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," stated Farnocchia. "Therefore, until October 2020, it will only be with larger telescopes to be seen".
Several observatories have already taken the visitors to the visual. In a first study, a team of Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterisation of 1I/'Oumuamua, the diameter of the sky object to 2 to 16 kilometers. Records of the Gemini-Observatorium on Hawaii show a clear sulphur of the comet.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of Canarys (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar swabbers, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to the comets of our solar system, and that indicates that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comet in other solar systems could be formed by similar processes as in our, supplemented the León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of the same two interstellar visitors within just two years, according to IAU, indicates that these objects could open up a new way to research certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often such stippvisites are, it is still difficult to assess. One of the next interstellar visitors may take a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency Esa.
The Agency wants to station the three-party "Comet Interceptor" (now, for example, cometen-devangegers), at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometers away from the earth. It is supposed to be the director of Esa-Wissenschaftsman Günther Hasinger, either on a still unreached, fresh comets from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitors such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
At this point before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is as far as: On the new Mega-Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines is landed, a special honor for Captains and Crew.
Around 45 million passengers are supposed to be manufactured by 2022 on the new airport annually, 2025 it is already 72 million. China's president Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion project. The latest prestige project China is called "seesters" because of its six poor building structure.
The complex has four starting and land stations that will later be extended to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new bus transportes passengers in just 20 minutes into the city of Pekings.
During construction, the Chinese people had made it several times clear that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the smaller capital airport since 2006 has been moved in Germany, and in contrast, a first passenger machine was already landed for four years.
New cross-border aircraft is supposed to fly 2030: 4 hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours, the British Space Agency is dreaming of the UK Space Agency. This, for the 20-30s flight in the overlap rate, is supposed to be a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company developed reaction engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the Agency. "This is the technology that could ultimately achieve it," said Agent Graham Turnock to the sender. "We speak of the 20-30s for operation, and the work has been advanced very advanced".
To advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work closely with the Australian closely together. A flight from the British capital to Australian Metropole is currently lasting about 20 hours. As far as the only cross-border air ticket for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the route from 1976 to the setting of its operation 2003 and used for three to three and a half hours. In 2000, there was an accident at the start of a Concorde at the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 insassen were killed. Last year, the U.S. Airbuilder Lockheed Martin planned, together with the U.S. Space Authority Nasa, to develop an overclock flight vehicle, the "X-Plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point-Transport", writes Reaction Engines on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the erdatmosphere and thus allow the "nächst generation truly removable rhm apparatus".
Revolution in Washington: Trump wants to experience anonymous tipers in Ukraine
In the Ukraine affair for possible power abuse of the US President, Donald Trump wants to find possible enlightened places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," said Trump on Thursday before US staff at the United Nations in New York. The affected person was almost "a spion" and with such a "a little different" in the past than today.
This was regarded as an intimidation attempt against hinters. The event was actually not public. Several US media spread audio mixtures on Friday by the speech. Democrats responded to the statement of the President.
The Democrats in the U.S. Representatives' House had announced preparations for a deliberation procedure against Trump on Tuesdays. Their prerequisites were particularly based on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service workers, which raised severe accuses against Trump and its government centre. The paintings of the notor were made on Thursday publication on large public pressure.
In the framework of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government staff, which the US President will use "the power of his office" in order to achieve that another country is interfering to its favours in the 2020 American War.
In the centre of the prerogatives, a controversial phoneship between Trump and the Ukraine President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his official colleagues to examine which might harm his political rival Joe Biden. In the race, the former businesses of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and promising efforts to protect his jurisdiction from the Ukrainian justice.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine Telephonate also to the interpretation: The leader of government co-workers had tried to keep the exact textual statement of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol was made. This was after the conversation of lawyers from the White House but removed from a database normally provided for for it and was stored in a specially protected system.
The designer's identity is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it should be a person of the CIA’s foreign secret service.
In a series of Tweets on Friday, the President wrote on the subject, among other things, the "so-called whistleblower" has distributed information from second hand, which would have been inappropriate. That is why there may be no hinter or spoon.
The President of the U.S. Representatives House, Nancy Pelosi, was alarmed and accused that Trump's statement was undermining the integrity of the government.
In the representative house, several studies against Trump and its environment have been carried out in several committees for months. In view of Ukraine prerequisites, the Democrats are now continuing research with new woeving to launch a possible method of deployment against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a plan for our investigation," said Chief of the Secret Service Committee in the Representative House, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, throwed him a false representation of the things and called for a retreat of the Committee's presidency. Trump was regularly insulting ship and had already demanded its return.
More than 300 former U.S. government co-workers from the security and foreign policy sector, which were morely active under democratic, but also under republic presidents, put themselves in a declaration published on Friday behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible defense procedure. If the prerequisites were true, the "a scrupellose power abuse" by Trump would be called it.
There is no precise timetable for the further process. With its majority in the representative house, democrats could strive to a so-called impeachment process. However, the decision on an actual office survey falls in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far no U.S. president has yet been dispensed by an impeachment process of the Office.
VW-Betriebs Council: Jobs are being reduced "sleaking"
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce the cost of production could be due to the load of production in Germany and Europe, which is concerned with the automotive board, and the brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros, which will already be distributed 500 million euros this year.
A key to this is the staff costs. In 2016, the "accession Pact" negotiated between firms and operating councils already provides for the reduction of 14.000 jobs in Germany alone. In general, a job can only be reduced by the autobuilder if quasi is proved that the activities associated are no longer required. In addition, employment insurance applies until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from business councils, however, jobs in production that are actually not in place to disposition will be "sleaking" over another way - so at the official course. This often does not re-establish regular jobs.
In these cases, the Management Council has no opportunity to force the re-employment. In the meantime, many people are missing, the labor poems are increasing, the anxiety of a gradual explosion of the vehicles would be greater. In order to increase the fear that the vehicle production could be discharged from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. From VW, it was only said: "A adaptation of employment volume is done as agreed along the demografic curve."
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide and control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and also speed up decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus increase competitiveness. The production board Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "We are well advised to make our crises firm in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China."
On this path there are already successes: For example, this year's first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would be reduced in comparison to the previous year. Before journalists said Tostmann that the production time for the Gulf 8 is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg by 1.1 hours. Exact figures for the production period do not call VW, according to information of our newspaper it is around the Gulf 7
20 hours.
In our region the family work Wolfsburg is the only VW Fabrik in which vehicles are produced. The works of braun-switch and salt-gitter manufactured components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern, VW-Interns applies the Faust rule that there must be 80,000 cars built annually so that the work is satisfactory. In 2018, the exhaustation in Wolfsburg was only about 700.000 vehicles - consisted of the sensed Diesel demand and the problems in converting to the new consumption and gas testing process WLTP.
As Tostmann has already announced last year, however, a million cars are supposed to be "pervisive" from the band in Wolfsburg. This is intended to enable the bundling of the golf production in the stemwork - because the work of Zwickau deals with the transformation of the location for the e-auto production.
Furthermore, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales numbers of Gulf and Tiguan have been deteriorated. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8. He is supposed to remain the Brot-and-Butter car of the Wolfsburgers despite all the efforts to build e-Mobility.
With Voodoo forced to prostitution: human dealer condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been occupied with swores, in the Ruhr area and have been forced to prostitution, and six malicious human dealers have to be in prison.
Six discouraged human dealers from Nigeria have been sentenced to currency and liability from up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The accused young women from Nigeria had been slandered and forced to prostitution. To force their obedience to force the Nigerians had still had to give a ritual scar in the home before a voodoo prize.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought through the Mediterranean with the help of libyanic sleeves in smoking boats. However, the dream of a better future did not meet. In Germany they were distributed to various boards to work on the supposed lock user costs of an average of EUR 25,000, so they were completely reduced.
The accused - four men and two women - had the inclusion and the next distribution of the young Nigerians on boardels in the process. "The work made women physically and psychically difficult," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the judgment proclaiming. "One were correctly answered."
The judgments are based on the inclusion of foreigners, human trade, conservation and heavy force prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
Fem Standing Conflict with the Lufthansa Group again drove the Ufo Flight Championship with Streiks.
If the company did not return to the negotiation table, the trade union will inform "on 14 October the labour campaign measures in the LH Group", the Ufo tariff Board Daniel Fohr, on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings have been refusing to carry out the Ufo tariff negotiations for months. It is also about the question whether the trade union has legally announced tariff agreements in the Lufthansa.
In this point, Ufo now looks stronger after a decision by the Frankfurt Working Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the tariff agreements were not announced. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and verified to submit the laws. "I think that a second court is totally different from the matter," said Ufo Board of Flow.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the Frankfurt National Working Court in order to make the status of the Ufo legally assessed as a trade union.The company argued that the union has not set a representative board for months and should not be able to fill its role as a tariff partner.
In the past, there was a strong leadership in the Spartenwerk, in which many members of the Board and the Advisory Board have come back, including the long-standing union leader Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had suspended a already-running original agreement on the Championship of the Kabinenpersonal at Eurowing's end of July.
Feeled arrival: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but that is to change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa destinations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. Until 2030 you want to increase international and home visitors to 100 million per year, the tourism Commission shared.

Saudi Arabia is hardly accessible for tourists. Visawers usually only for short business trips, religious passenger trips or visitors with family in the desert state provision. With the new rules, the erzconservative Kingdom hopes to reduce more revenue from tourism business. According to its own expression, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In the middle of September, several rockets and drones had taken two of the most important oil plants in the East Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery of the country in Abkaik as well as the oil field of Churai. In the line, the national oil production was drastic, the oil price shots to the height. It should last several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom again reaches its old level.

Half of the European tree species is threatened by extinction
In addition to damages, the World Nature Protection Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of which occurs to no other continent. Of this 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before the death.
The IUCN shares hazardous species in six categories: "potentially threatened" via "dangered", "stark threatened", "from extinction" and "deceased" to "deceased" worldwide, lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants than threatened worldwide.
Eberece and wild Ross kastania threatened
In Germany, especially Ebereschen (Sorbus) is threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are as small as well as through the transformation or weakening of their living spaces".
It looks like bad for the wild habitarian Rosscastania. Since 2017, it has been "risk" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN-Skala. Largest threat is the Balkan minermotte. It has been widened since the 1980s of Southeast Europe across the continent and has little natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Rosscastania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 100,000 copies. Not taken into account in this assessment, the trees in cities, parks and alone.
Types and mooses also in danger
The IUCN scientists simultaneously created new European red lists for weekly animals, streams and mooses. More than a fifth of the weekly animals and mooses and almost half of all struik species were threatened, so the IUCN. This is mainly the destruction of wildlife, inclined species, agricultural practices and climate change. Weekly animals such as snakes played a key role in recyceling nutrients in the ground and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the European Bureau. "We need to limit human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species priority".

The Super Bowl is the highest point of the American football season. The game and half-time show are among the most viewed TV transfers of the USA. Even though you have last fallen out of viewers: In this February, the spectacle in the United States had been the least viewers for more than ten years.

Cook training: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to face the plague of the travel provider Thomas Cook according to a press report. High depreciations are threatened to outstanding loans and loans. The credit suisse is also affected, writes the "Financial Times" in their release of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or credit suisse should probably make total depreciations in the range of up to 1,8 billion British pounds (and 2 billion euros), the report. The estimates of the consultative company AlixPartners were shown.
The creditors of bonds should buy depreciations from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts which are actually depreciated are expected to be found at the upper end of the bandwidths, said a expert to the sheet.
As much as the losses of the believers will be in fact, after the expiry of the insolvency process, one nearly person would not be too much hopeful. For example, the about 40 aircraft from Thomas Cook in Britain would be "old" and many of the real estates are in bad situations. Most of the money you could get out with the sales of the airport slots and Thomas Cook, it also said.
Rackete should have brought humiliate killers to Italy
The Sea-Watch-Capean Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have foltered and killed in Libya. "We can't exclude this but have no secure information about this," said the speaker of the Sea-Watch refugee organization, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have re-established the three men in Italy. They are being suspected to rape, torture and kill people in Libya. The disciplines were arrested in the recording camp in the Italian Messina. Neubauers stressed that the refugee organisations could not verify who they left their ships. "The come without passes."

USA warn Federal Government against Huawei
The Chief of the US Internet Authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," said Pai to the "Handle sheet" with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which requires each company to follow instructions of the security bodies under Chinese law.
The law applicable also prohibits the company to inform third parties about such requests," said the FCC-Chef. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to request a "trustworthy declaration" from suppliers.
Berlin wishes to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "Handlesheet" report on their own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to the latest. This software consists of billion lines of program code that change with time," said Pai.
It was "what difficult to introduce" that a governmental authority, "also where it would be able to check every individual update in real time to detect security risks", says the FCC-Chef.
The Chinese company Huawei presents close contacts with the Chinese state device:
The property ratios are imperfect. The employee company, which supposedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai to the "Handlesheet".
The United States lays out findings on which government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for conversations in Berlin in order to purchase for the position of the United States.
Chemistry factory in North France burns: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire has been deleted after hours – but the spacious work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and children's cryps remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities would not open the facilities precautiously on Friday, the competent prefectures were informed. The Ministry of Interior had invited the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to dispose of smoke. Injuries were not injured. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals into the inside, protect their feeds and first to introduce the harvest.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture told. It is still the risk that after the removal of smell, the prefecture was spread on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firms were in use at the fireplace and 90 police and gendarmen.
The chemical factory has previously risen a gigantic black smoking column. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the company Lubrizol, the additive for oil repair. The production plant is a few kilometers from the city centre.
The factory in Normandie belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations that are particularly monitored. In 1976, the Italian Seveso was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefecture of the Normandie region, Pierre-André Durand, said the news sender BFMTV, it was not first found "home toxicity" in samples. A pollutation of the nearest his couldn't be excluded. In the river, studemies were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire was broken out early morning by 02.40 o'clock, reported the authorities. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropole and is located on the Seine between Paris and the harbour town of Le Havre.
French Minister for Finance: "Germany must invest and now"
The French economic and financial minister Bruno Le Maire has invited Germany to increase investments in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest and now, ever before, better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening in the idea of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the euro area is weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation is worsened to make the necessary decisions."
Actions should be made to those countries who would have budgetary room for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these spaces, added to the minister and referred to the high State debt of his country, which is in more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French government debt must be "stabilized" and "censed", said Le Maire.
In the past years, France has repeatedly called upon Germany to operate more public investment in order to experience the European economy. In contrast, German politicians in France have always called on again to get their budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides tax reductions of more than 9 billion euros for households.
In this way, the French government, among other things, responds to the protests of the yellow-west movement, is to reduce the new debt to 2.2 per cent, expected 3.1 per cent in this year.
Is he still trying to tricks?: Johnson softens question about Brexit actics
The British Prime Minister Johnson criticizes the "Campulation Act" adopted by Parliament.
The Parliament is back to prescribe a law to the British Prime Minister to avoid a Chaos brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a sluipflock. On this basis, the Tory policyist is dismissing.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he wants to carry out an uncontrolled brexit - despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which should prevent it.
The law suggests that the government must apply to a shift of the date of entry, no agreements with the EU should be reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as the "Capulation Act", which is difficult for negotiations with the EU.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major said that Johnson could try to use "political canvas" in order to avoid the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure strike which shifts the entry into force of the law to time after the EU entry. Johnson said that he strives to put an agreement with the European Union. "We are confident that we leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the agreement".
Johnson's Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings stated, however, that he felt the political contradictions on the Brexit as "speaking in the park" and showed that the endeavoured EU performance still comes to stand: "We enjoy that, we will win, we will come out (Anm. Red.: from the EU), no concern," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph".
Cummings, who led the Brexit Campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the EU-Referendum 2016, now acts as head officer in the British Headquarters Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that led to the Prime Minister to a decisive situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood before the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Tass) is deeply awarded into the whole private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married with her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was very proud and stimulated when he presented the picture band "The Polaroid Diaries" in the middle of September in Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrated guests also belonged to Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harron and Pretenders-Frontfrau Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a thrilling glance in the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for the challenge of LindaMcCartney as engaged artist and the immediate magic of the Polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always on it. Thousands of polaroids, some hundred of them are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s until the late nineties. "They wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekov Eshun in his preface. Of course, there is always one in the focus: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him.
Since he danced with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, phoned in the bathing garment with a tissue on her head or wearing unshaped moon boats. Surely the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the light of the light of the light of the light of her farm in southern Ireland or in Scotland, there was also a very normal life. So Mary McCartney said that she had been sleeping as a baby in a bed that had bailed her father from old potato tubes. And it was not always revealed at the McCartneys.
Like hardly another medium, the Poloraid camera begins the instant moment. Linda McCartney's recordings are certainly a kind of family day book, but they are much more than pure snippets.
It's about the decision Click: You have to recognize if you're happening a great photo before you. And then you've got to cut it in the exact right moment," Paul McCartney said. "Knip one two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo," and Linda had the gift to always take the right moment. "You just knew that she had it," said Paul in the Eshun Essay.
This is true of the light, the composition, the image cut and the colors, which "The Polaroid Diaries" make not only an entertainable imagebook for Beatles-Fans, but not only an anecdotic also a large aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes work even once as abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the currently newly established Beatles-Album "Abbey Road", which has appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will buy further oil and gas from Iran"
The Turkey wants to import further oil and gas from the neighbouring country despite the US sanctions related to Iran. The Turkish President, Recep Tayip Erdogan, said in an interview published on Friday, which Turkey could not cancel oil and gas import from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he participated in the UN full meeting.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey has problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "returned from the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "is going to continue our relations with Iran in particular in this question and in many other questions," said Turkish President who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States have been following a "maximal pressure" policy since their exit from the International Atomic Agreement with Iran against the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, Iran follows an atomic programme in secret and does not respect the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the breakdown of Iranian oil exports and a heavy economic crisis in Iran, and in recent months the tensions in the Gulf region have significantly increased.
US government wants to restrict the adoption of refugees
The U.S. government wants to restrict refugees drastically, and the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained on Thursday, the annual limit of a new settlement programme should be reduced from 300,000 to 18,000 refugees from now to 40 percent, which corresponds to a section of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States would continue to see the support of refugees, but it is important to protect US citizens and serve them, and at the moment the US migration system was overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the adoption of two refugees groups: people who are pursued because of their faith - and Iraq who have helped the US military in the country and thus risked the explanation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, however, the maximum of 1500 refugees should be taken.
The programme set up in 1980 selects refugees from UNO-Lagers around the world and relocated in the United States. The limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current limit of 30.000 is a deepest. As the predecessor of the US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House, was nearly 8.000.
Helping organisations responded to the announced reduction of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. Thus the USA would further harm their leadership in protecting the most injurious people in the world.
Trump is trying to restrict immigration to the United States - legally such as illegal - strictly. The US government expects its own information for the next year of 350,000 asylum applications. These figures are separated from the new-site programme.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a spider"
U.S. president Donald Trump has observed in the Whistleblower's spionage. Whoever has always given him the informant who has given him power abuse, "come a spider," said Trump, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. It reports several U.S. media.
So Trump spoke to employees of the United Nations Mission. When he was asked for the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied: "This comes near to a spider." Then Trump added: "When we were in ancient times, when we were smart? Right. The spies and betray, we kept dealing with it a little different than we do it now."
Observers rated the last remarks on possible indication of the death penalty. Democrats exercised sharp criticism of Trump's statements and warned him intimidation of witnesses. It also tried to hinder a conventional examination of a possible deliberation procedure against him, the Presidents of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory Affairs at the Representative House wrote.
The Whistleblower presents the President's complaint in a now published complaint to have abused his office in order to request a mixture of another country into the US-Wahl 2020. Concrete, among other things, his controversial phoneate with his Ukraine office colleagues Wolodymyr Selenskyj in summer: In the conversation, Trump closed him to introduce investigations against his possible democratic Herausforder Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contested every disadvantage.
However, as New York Times reports, the Whistleblower should act as an analytic of the CIA’s foreign secret service.

Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork can quote real estate markets
WeWork has risen in New York as the largest office owner.
Within less years, WeWork increases from the small startup to drive power on the world's most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in the crisis.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens the balance on the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had set down founder Adam Neumann a boss, moved the planned stock exchange and started selling daughter companies and values such as the private jet for the leaders to win financial space for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect, among other things in New York and London, the largest tenants of the market.
WeWork accepts large office areas for long term and rent it in partly small units to members. This can be single volunteers, small start-ups or whole departments of large companies. So far, WeWork burns money in stunning speed with this business. Last year, the company entered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a sales of 1.8 billion dollars. In this year only the rental costs by the rental are estimated to have risen to $2.5 billion. To limit the loss, the new company's management will now have drawn up the emergency brakes and the renting of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now completed rental contracts with periods of up to 15 years from which obligations are compulsory of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could not only be the case for the company itself and its investors, but for all real estate markets.
According to the calculations of the Economics Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rent in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months nearly 30,000 square meters of office. All WeWork's new contracts made sure that the demand for offices in New York was larger than the new areas that were on the market during this time. Without WeWorks Expansion, the office clearance in the US metropole was increased in this time, as Alpert wrote in "Business Insider". Likewise, weWork looked at several dozen office locations in the best location.
Also in the British capital, the balance in the real estate market could be felt without further expansion of the aggressive startup. WeWork Hauptmieter, in a last year by the Sparkassen-Fond-Anbieder Deka for almost 100 million euros purchased office house in the centre of financial metropole.
Many owners have renovated their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. In order to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners should well write a part of the expected billion revenues. Access to the reserves of WeWork, without any short time, they did not have a long-term rental contracts. For the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by additionally established subsidiary companies, called special Purpose Vehicles for which the parent company is only liable in close limits.
Russia took up many North Korean fishermen again
The Russian coastal wake has been again against North Korean fishermen. Over the past days, more than 262 wild people have been arrested in the waters illegally, the Russian domestic secret service was reported by the Interfax Agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. Before, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured; this time there were no injuries, it was said that the Communist North Korea suffered from chronic food lack.
Accordingly, the North Korean fishermen were traveling to Russian high waters. There, the coastal wake of Russia takes their own information on the protection of their multiesbiological resources patrouills. In the renewed controls, 30,000 ink fish have been discovered. In addition, the information according to three fishermen and two motor boats has been taken and posted after Nachodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok. The Agency Ria Nowosti found a total of more than 8.000 infringements in 2018.
The Russian Fisheries Authority has also not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans after complaints of local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there in 2019.
The Chief of the Association of Russian Fisheries in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained high environmental damages by the North Korean fishermen. They fought with the close synthetic networks in Russia. These would also remove small livestock from the sea. In addition, the networks would simply dispose on the sea where they needed 200 years to be displaced.
In the premature arrests, three members of the Russian coastal wake were injured by Moscow, and one also wounded North Korean died later at its infringements. At that 17 September, Russian border guardians first fixed a north Korean boat and then a second after that opened the fire.
USA related entry ban on ex-president Castro
The United States have related bans against the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs founded it in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "great human rights infringements". As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he presented a system where thousands of Cubans would be arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As President of the military forces, the brother of the dead revolution leader Fidel Castro was also guilty of human rights injured by the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The misrepresentation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the lasting crisiss on Cuba and Venezuela," the American Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had prohibited entry bans against venezolanian governments and military members. In Venezuela, a bitter force fight between the government and opposition has been held. The United States have linked a number of sanctions against Maduros to force him into the knee and to help him to the opposition leader and self-sponent interim president Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is one of the most closely tied Maduros. The Socialist Caribbean is given by Venezuela oil in exchange for services. According to the United States and the Venetian opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in the oppression of government entrepreneurs.
New climate protests of Fridays for future
One week after the largest international climate tests today, but thousands of people want to go to the street for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate week, the movement of Fridays for futures will re-establish actions and communications in thousands of countries worldwide. At the beginning of the time shift New Zealand and Australia, before the protests are moving across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large public in Canada in Montreal. Also before the White House in Washington, demonsmen wanted to collect.
The size of the world's claim of this Friday after the record participation of the premature is relatively uncler. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, more than four million people have scattered for the climate. We make this Friday again!" she wrote on Twitter. Until now there were 6383 actions in 170 countries in the context of the Streikwoche.
Especially in Germany, the increase was very great last Friday. A good third of all the world's demonstrations - around 1.4 million - had been involved in the protests in Fridays for future in 575 German cities. This time a list of motions are planned in at least 65 cities. In this way in Metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in Nordrhein-Westfalen or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the street for climate.
In the age of 15, Thunberg had been set before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to encourage the politicians of their country to make a stronger use of climate protection, and there has been the Friday for fouture movement. In the climate protests, especially students and students are involved, but also increasingly scientists and other adults.
Together, it calls for more ambition in the fight against heating and the threatening climate catastrophe, especially in view of the Paris Climate Agreement, to reduce global warming to less than 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial period.
Thunberg was nearly a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-sea race in New York. There she had been participating in the United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday, she held a emotional speech to the UN in which she spoke to the heads of government and government of the earth. On Wednesday, Stockholm, she was told her to use the alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Lifehood Foundation.
Russia forbids smoke on the balcony
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoke," said a speaker of the emergency ministery on Thursday in Moscow of the Tass Agency. The ban is supposed to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, therefore, must expect a penalty of 3.000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should simplify a fire, then the penalty falls higher. According to the ban, the ministerial is also burning candles. Also to grill meat on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Schlag against Cyber criminal - Consumer has out of servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German mediators have first exempted a large server provider for illegal businesses in the Darknet.
In total 13 perpetrators are suspicious to have hosted numerous websites on the Mosel as operators of an accounting center in an former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach, through the international aggressive crimes.
This shared the General State Prosecutorship. Seven act suspects were arrested on Thursday evening at a large action. The Darknet is a paved part of the Internet.
Customers of the act suspects are supposed to have been disrupted by the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which had been in spring. The attack on 1.25 million Telekom-Route at the end of November 2016 was controlled by the Cyberbunker, according to the Advocate General State Office.
One such hoster was first excelled in Germany. A Webhoster provides infrastructure for an Internet site.
In the access action with support for special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in the neighbouring abroad. It has been resulted in almost five years of investigations. At lunch, the mediators want to inform more details.
New World Climate Protests of Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate tests today, but thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate week, the Friday movement planned for future actions and communications in thousands of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in Metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large public in Canada.
Climate protests >>eng<< Who are actually Thunberg's backdrops?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, including in the 21st century, in a world full of wars and smoke factors that warmen the climate. Is it so amazing that an 16-year-old girl keeps the powermen of this time in front of the nose. But what is there about? Is it helpful or safe marketing of a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics about his own?
On the other hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses into movement and brings young people to raise for a better climate-friendly world. It is not the first time in Europe that a young man creates a collection of children and adolescents for itself. In 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt out of herself to be used for a more just world. At that time, it has also been able to win a crowd of young people for himself, and this is about crossing the sea to get into the praised country, similar to Greta Thunberg recently made on the trip to America with a sailing boat.
But there is a shadow page about this? Why does it need an share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR manager on its side. In addition, her mother has published a book that has been far-reaching sold, thanks to the daughter of the Rampenlight. Also old-whole followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disappointed about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably put up some followers to thick. This is also not unfounded because the action came to the media around the world very well and it flows a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here the spirits are now separated: Is it morally right to reach the race of the world? Is it still authentic if certain individuals work together during the world's rescue action with stock breeders? What is the position ultimately involved, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, since democracy lives by different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can also seem to be critical about projects by certain trend settlers.
Komet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A stranger comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The mutations of the astronomers have confirmed: a strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment - he is only the second of his kind.
Garching/Washington - Lange have just thought of the researchers, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is currently doing astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers on the Krim
The said body was discovered by an astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Krim. He looked at a self-builded telescope to heaven and further observers confirmed his first suspect. It is actually an unknown comet that is not from our solar system. He is only the second of his way looking at during the flight.
The great chance for astronomers is now to get out of views into a foreign solar system. It is evident that the comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the Canary astrophysical Institute. The comet is, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), clearly intercentric origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbell train that leads him out of our system.
Comeet has been seen before flight - and can be observed several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can watch it in detail. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been looked at in his flight, which means that he can be studied from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the largest brightness in the middle of December and then be seen with medium-scale telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the U.S. Room Travel Authority Nasa. "Therefore October 2020 it will only be watched with larger professional telescopes".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First knowledge about Comet 2I/Borisov waking hopes in science
According to the first insights, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers of diameter. At the same time, the sky body seems to be similar to our comets - for like the IAC researcher Julia de León, the spectrum of the sweifster is our similar. This observation shows that comets in other solar systems could be formed by similar processes as in our, supplemented de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the watch goes beyond individual knowledge. That two such objects have already been discovered within only two years, may allow a new way to examine certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are continually engaged in researchers. A giant asteroid was just over the earth recently, and they came dangerously.
"Absolutely confusing": Rachel Johnson defeats about brother
At Boris Johnson, his younger brother first leave the cabinet, now his sister, with clear words, assembles the warrical language of the Prime Minister as "smackless". It is not the brother who she knows.
"Capulation", "Betrug", contract,: Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands under pressure and always stands on - at least verbal. During the questionnaire in the subhouse on this Wednesday, this was the subject of enormous embellion of opposition, and in the meantime there have been further critics to say: Dutzende Bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author said to the sender Sky News, her brother uses words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of a EU appearance "hanged, long-reached, celebrated, bound and bound." They think that it is very vague. They do not recognize the version of their brother, Rachel Johnsons, who came to the Anti-Brexit party in the elections of the EU Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
In particular, she felt that her brother, Jo Cox, mentioned that a EU-friendly sub-house order that was murdered by a Neonazi, who had been most honored by passing the Brexit, had Boris Johnson said in the sub-house. "It is very smackless to refer to a Member who was murdered by someone who was called 'Britain first'," now Johnson's sister criticized. The dader seemed to have come out of the right-extreme camp that was "by this type of language".
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick if Jos Name is used in this way," he twittered. The best way to honor it is, if you were suffering and determined for what you think - no matter what you're thinking. But never you dare "the other side demonize". He also accused that a atmosphere was created in the attacks were more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson had set his office as a State Secretary and his mandate as a Tory deputy. "I had been broken between loyalty to family and national interest in the past months - it is an insoluble tension," founded Jo Johnson the step.
Johnson's language also took a sharp criticism in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 Bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "does not be worthy". In a common state they stated: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside the Parliament, was not acceptable. We should talk with respect for one another."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez get up at Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: In the semi-time show of the coming Super Bowl two women with Latino worzels, promised "a explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the semi-time show when the US football Liga NFL ended on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredible and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo. Because this has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira shared in a video.
The final of the American Football Liga, which celebrates its 100th birthday in the next year, will take place on 2 February in Miami. In the Metropole at the south-Spitze Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is puerto-rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl this time put two women on stage - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all the Americans and the world. She promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-olds were born in New York after their parents were exposed from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also worked as a actress and is in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas.
Shakira became a star of a telenovela and singer in Colombia. She created her first two-speaked album in 2001 and the single "Whenever, whereever".
This year, many of them are also selected as political gestures. Finally, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is divided deeply.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided Furore. In general, look at the NFL finance far over 100 million TV viewers, it is now very popular in Germany.
Last year, there was political conflicts in the past. Reason was the fight around the Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused from protest against police force against blacks to raise themselves when playing the national hymns and, among others, had been hard approached by US President Donald Trump. From solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians rejected a super-bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the Rock Group of Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
An actress and Youtuber adds Egypt's ruler: First, Mohamed Ali remains rather abroad.
The two men who have influenced whether on the streets of Egypt float blood, have spent the last week both abroad. One of them rejoined on Friday at Kairo Airport. State President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The Ex-General, who in 2013 lost the Muslimbruder Mohammed Mursi, the first freely chosen state head of the country, had brought a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump praised Sissis action against the political Islam and did not lose silver about human rights injuries at the Nile - in a week, in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds because they were waiting to protest against the President. He said "He has no reason for concern," said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of the state's. "The Egyptians are not going into the iron."
According to the President of the other man, who is currently determining the events on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he was trying to withdraw from the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him when he tried to enter Egyptian soil. For weeks the 45-year-old as actor was only known as a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tonant voice that governed the political discourse in the cafés, the living and theestubes of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets" Ali calls his people to raise against Sisi.
While the people hungry, the President in the luxury and let himself build new palaces, says it. The army leader, on which Sisi supports his rule, represents Ali corruption and enrichment. Because he made it for 15 years with just these men's businesses for 15 years, he seems quite precisely to know what he speaks – at least the impression of many Egyptians, how the just to explode clicks are shown.
After last week, since Sisis handle had been demonstrated by thousands of people against his rule and nearly 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians who had been arrested, Ali called a "million marsch" for this Friday. That really would be so many people watching the streets, was unlikely. But it came to integrate small protests, for example in Giseh at Kairo, and in the place of Kina at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests whose participants were al-Sisi corruption and demanded for his abstraction. At these protests, the police also included tear gas and rubber shots. These videos did not be independently verified at first. From security circles, the police said.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonsarents last week were Banner with the portrait of the president in pieces, was reported on Friday enormous police website. Security forces built in the city and on the outer streets. In Kairo several bus stations in the city were closed because of "conservation", most streets around the Monteirplatz, the heart of the Revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, on which 2013 followers of the crashed Muslimbruder Mursi sent off until the arms took it under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent unequivocal gathering: Sisis future party was expected to hold out a large condition for the presidents.
Mohamed Ali gave these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrirplatz," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us collapse with police officers". However, as a retreater, it is not to understand, "Gant Egypt is the Tahrirplatz".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection is always much slower than the provider, there are different test options.
Anyone who closes an Internet contract does not need blind trust in the speed specifications of the providers. Customers can check the amount of it is actually achieved in the case of suspicions.
Finally, the priorly promised transfer rates are a contract component and should therefore be achieved, explain the consumer central Bayern.
If the connection is always much slower than the provider, there are different test options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The supplier's tests are, however, carried out according to the specific requirements of providers and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively", gives consumer central Bayern to their side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set an appropriate period of 14 days from the provider in general to produce the promised performance. This is best written by invoice.
Does this also affect nothing for multiple requests, customers can announce and may also require damages. However, in excessive success, only the complaint path is still helping.
First Ranghoher Republican for Examination
As the first Ranghoher Republicans, the governor of Vermont has expressed itself for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think that the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from here, will be determined by the facts that are detected," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about Whistleblower-Affäre before measures - a impeachment procedure can be taken to the president.
Scott said that he was not surprised by enthusiasm that Trump repeatedly asked Ukraine President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to examine interventions by the democratic president and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump observed "seat years".
Rev. republics have not yet been recognized with criticism to Trump because of the whistleblower affair; few have been able to detect this. Scott’s statements are a first sign of it in Trump's Party. Scott, a moderate republican, has already applied against Trump's policy, such as against the reluctation of environmental legislation and the deterioration of immigration legislation.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: Next Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all the Spider-Man-Fans: at the end of August, it was known that Sony and Marvel will go separate paths in the future. Tom Hollands Spider-Man would therefore not be more part of the "Avengers" universe.

I and all at the Marvel studios are most pleased that we can continue working on ... He is the only superheld with the ability to play in different Universes, as Sony continues to work on his spider story. You never know what the future will bring."
But what is happening to the sudden good news? Seriously, Sony Marvel should have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Group of Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate in the revenue of Spider Man movies, but the message is not active.

Ägäis: Baby and four other children drink with boat unhappy
A baby and four other children are drunk in a refugee boat in the Aegeans. Overall, seven people died, as the Greek coastal guard told on Friday. Nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Currently, hundred migrants from Turkey pass to the Greek islands in the east of the Egyptians. Past year came on this route after information of the United Nations refugee aid (UNHCR) for 174 people. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the competent EU Commissioner, he would like to “inform Turkey about how it is about the refugee situation,” said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards he wishes to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help tackling.
On Friday, a speaker of the EU Commission confirmed the planned sea stationers with the EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, many migrants from Turkey continue to arrive unusually.On Tuesday only 654 people left to the Greek islands, it was called by the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Does Turkey deal still work?
The increased figures have arisen from doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016. This suggests that the EU can send all refugees and migrants who are illegally across Turkey to the Greek islands. In contrast, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each of the outgoing Syrians.
However, the processing of asylan applications is only difficult because of the lack of staff on the Greek side. Readbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Citizens, are almost 29 400 people. The worst place on Lesbos is: In a camp with capacity for 650 people, 5200 miggers are currently available.
Since the entry into force of the EU-Turky refugee Pact in March 2016, it had been so many, reported the Staterundfunk.

Green Policerin must be responsible for embarrassing photo pan
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, was manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green-Chefin holds a multi-way becher on a photo, but now came out: The becher was manipulated.
Ottawa/Kanada - It has been quite long staying - and finally never noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, had never been in hand. On the party's website, she was on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens.

Influencerin wants to increase free: lifelong flight ban at Cathay
A upgrade was provided by Cathay Pacific via mail, but when she asked for the check-in, she was not allowed to fly on board - and she should never be allowed to fly again with Cathay.
Spontan get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream. Sometimes they have luck, and the employees at the check-in offer free exchange from the Economy Class.

The writing wishes to have received the influencerin by an airline marketing employer. On the other hand, the Airline accused Jaqueline to have infected the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried to get an upgrade for the long-term flight again. This time, the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they were imitated at the central. And in fact, the employer, from which the mail, is supposed to have devoted the mail contact with Jaqueline. That also confirmed the mail system where the messages were not raised.
Airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and attached a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (and 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencerin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company who represents consumer interests, for Cathay had paid the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the costs for the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline is not receiving the mail metadata, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the Influencerin Betrug has committed, it remains locked for future flights. The business conditions of the Airline also claim that they do not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied - and now enter an advocate.

North Korea holds third summit of Trump and Kim in question
North Korea has doubts that in the nuclear conflict it will soon come to a third summit of power owner Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and success of such a meeting are in question because of lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, Spitzendiplomat Kye-gwan said on Friday according to the KCNA.
The United States had not yet done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the advisor of the Nordkorean Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and also criticized US sanctions and the common military manoeuvres of the United States and South Korea, but he hoped for a "wise" and "mutige" decision Trumps to bring it back to a closeness.
Trump said on Monday, he wanted to know what a third summit meeting should bring with Kim before he was ready to explain. The negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean Atomic and Rocket Programme have been administered in Hanoi since the missing second summit meeting of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June both met in the enmilitarized zone between the two Korean States. They agreed to re-establish the discussions, but far without great success.

Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the first director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the Lightathletic Association.
New details about the Doping Scanal in Russia will come to the appearance of the Leichtathletic World Cup, and they destroyed the little of the credibility of the Russian sports at the beginning of the year and had only been able to return. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Labor finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now, it was found that they were false.
In December 2014, a systematic fraud has been revealed in Russian sports. On this occasion, the Wada had locked the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian sporters were not exhibited by the world industry. The International Olympic Committee reads after individual testing during the summer games 2016 in Rio around 270 atlets of the country under neutral flag, in the winter games in February 2018, were 168 Russian sports leaders and sporters at the start. They were also allowed to be held in the various sports in the summer in Russia even the fusssball World Cup with the host as participants.
Positive found missing
In the following September, the Wada reappeared the Rusada bank, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples called. The data should give inclusion on the extent of the interfering of doping folks at the state doping. They should help to punish atlets and atlets. Three months later they were finally delivered.
The chairman of the independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Lightathletic World Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data were manipulated from the Moscow Analysis Labor. "Yes. We received the data 9 months ago. We should check if the Task Force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurt General Zeitung" of Friday. "We have detected numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada has received from a Whistleblower, and those who have received them in January". Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The WM is not affected
This confirms the position of the IAF: The Lightathletic Association holds as the only organization at the Bann of Russia. At the WM, 30 Russian sportsmen start under the neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put manipulations in the room and Russia called to answer the prerequisites within three weeks. Russia now threatens the rest of Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion of the Olympic Games in Tokyo.
