No free Novelle for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukraine Parliament today refused the application to decree those paragraphs under a novel of the criminal law book, on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was sentenced.
The new scheme, which could have been able to eliminate the prisoner's exrematory minister, rejected the Members in the second reading of the application to migrant penalties for economic delicates.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment due to the conclusion of an alleged disadvantaged contract with Russia.
The judgment is not yet legal, in December the appeal of the judges is to be negotiated before court.
Timoshenko himself describes the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and also in the west, the process caused the suspicion of the prejudice of the court.
The application, Paragraf 365, on the basis of which the Minister of Expreme was sentenced to remove the criminal law book, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary to adopt.
Libyan Sieg
The history of libyan libyan libys or libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is located in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As it is commonly used in the elections of Islamists, the question is only that - the moderate or radical.
The National Transition Council was known to the right of habit of the Sharřa, from which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would be a country without crime, because for theft, you're just hacking the hand.
Women should also quickly forget emancipation thoughts, any abbreviations of faith, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be given from each other-related tribes in the future from the Coran.
Shortly - in Libya there will be a order that would hardly be predictable and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only – our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned libraries.
So it's more strange that the Muslim warfare forces were at all helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To their excuse, only the fact may be that NATO's air attacks were guided not by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose power was praised after any successful results.
The winners in Libya?
We only participated in a shooting change, served the interests of Islam and our politicians in the person of the dictator of a political bond without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred a military occupation of Libya.
This makes the Heavens anxious, namely the treachery of the cruise drivers.
But do the mineral oil companies get the black gold to spot price without Okkupation?
It is hard to say that the West can finally rob themselves with the right of selflessness in matters of protection of human rights.
If they do not ruin the Sharõa-vertreter.
Start of a new crisis-Era
France and the rest of Europe focused on the investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm deepened through Europe.
The individual States published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy was based in comparison to the prequartal, Germany and France.
But today, the obligation market is rising all records.
The investors keep not only Greece but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries in mind.
The Statistical Offices of the European Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
The GDP of Germany expected to grow by 0.5%, which from France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded a higher growth than was originally expected (wachstum was 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decline by 0.1% (surprising information only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, as compared to the prequartal, the gross domestic product was stagnated, according to Tsch. Statistical Office confirmed the trend in growth slowing up economic performance.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of the analytics.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this third quarter compared to the previous year, but compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy increased by 0.5% in the third quarter.
In the euro area and in the EU, the economy between July and September, compared with the previous quarter, was 0.2 percent, which corresponds to the expectations of the analytics.
In comparison to the previous year, the Greek economy rose by 5.2%.
The profits from its 10-year-old government bonds clarify the value of 28.45%.
The profits of the Italian and Spanish government bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also start feeling problems...
The Rendite in Czech state bonds is less than 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czech authorities qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The soccer selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-covered Čech and a magnificent gate from Petr Jiráček she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of happiness, the Czech football could defend his luxurious preface of the home game and will not again lack at the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rise in a detailed reportage.
Few excitement in the first half time and a giant sport of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also looked forward to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day of Jiráček in Montenegro.It has thus dissolved its ticket for the football-EM.
Also because of the exact defense game of the Czech team kings, they put the Montenegrines more pressure on it in the second half.
Damjanovic and Vucinic were the pearls of the party who shot two giant dances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will also be mixed next year with the European Championships, and it is also rejoicing that the Homeish football will add a premium to about 200 million.
From the first few minutes on, right fighting football was played.
Both teams combined long-term and so was played mainly around the central line.
During the second half of time, the pressure of the marriage team remained out, and the wide deposits before the penalty were successfully rejected by Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear program of their country.
They formed a living sign.
Some hundred college students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the nuclear program of their country before possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday afternoon before the object and then announced death to the USA and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Iranian Isphahan formed a live sign around the core technology center in Isfahan, where Urran was processed.
In this way, they wanted to know that they are ready to protect the nuclear program of their country, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report, the Iran seemed not to give up any nuclear weapon for its efforts.
Israel also speaks of possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed to the complex on the afternoon before the entrance and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack conducted in the intention to put the Iranian Atomic Programme widespreadly, the Israeli press would also be the target of the atomic enrichment plant in Natan's attack.
The food card of a fat child: it doesn't matter and eat to the evening bread Wurst
More than one third of the children of 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Current surveys proved - adept children are usually from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important for the healthy development of a man is the environment in which he grows up and are the examples surrounding him.
On the tables of adept children, worst goods are up to half more frequently on the table than in families where normally weighted children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had the elevation action under the "Adipositas" motto had no chance for the evening bread.
In families with dickerchen, sports also does not include the favourite employment, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents will find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey under 900 children
The survey took place last year by the end of the school year, with almost 900 children from basic schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This has already been the second year of the Action "Adipositas is not a random", supported by the General Health Kasse and the Society Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy cost and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors responsible for the intimidating number of children with overweight or even fatty.
"Only half of the questionned children, for example, led to eat five times a day, in the mode of breakfast-two breakfast lunch feeding food - one of the main prerequisites for healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and worst to the evening bread
Experts point out that relatively smallities, such as the regular family breakfast time, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families.
And - in most families, everyone starts to be alone.
The worst thing was the finding that in every tenth family is not at all freaked.
Breakfast is considered to be the basic stone of healthy daily diet.
The survey test, among other things, made it possible for overweight children to use many more frequently unhealthy pommes in the families.
And almost every - without consideration of weight - drinks sweet limonads every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the asked children operate sport, only less than half of their parents do this - only 15 percent.
Merge your own menu
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own food plan from the possibilities offered by appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer 12 to 15 in puncto food is far away from the ideal of healthy diet.
Among their favorite spices, many meal spices, meat dishes and natural sweets spices were.
"Alarming is especially the great popularity of sweet limonads," is highlighted in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main court, defeated teigwaren just before poultry.
The children nearly didn't like dwelling fruits and also the popularity of fish and vegetable courts as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite ready to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of the survey participants, which the questionnaire after the end of the clearing lecture "Adipositas has not been filled random" was in many cases a clear shift of preferences to principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project were set out.
This was obvious to the sweet limos, where many children began to give normal water priority.
The children crossed in the questionnaire also many more frequent poultry or fish as the main court of the day and were ready to eat less knees or sweet foods.
Profis claims - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introduction article on how Stylists learn, I had a bit melted that this was a bit too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know what's going on.
Lectures of three professionals from the industry, clothing problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the place" runs.
It's supposed to get worse.
Depending on the test, the more information and practical tasks are available to us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with director Alena (not participating in course), as one attracts a woman who has no ideal proportional figure.
And that's the most of us.
The one has one too short neck, the other are a too young figure without orderly curves and others are molly.
It is the matter of the stylist to visualize wide shoulders, extend the neck or to smudge the necessary curves.
We also received tips of how to attract a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - so with big buses, broad hips and narrow waist - beautiful and figurbetont without being provocative.
For example, if the difference between taille and hips is so large that the rock or the honey do not really fit, you should make at least one piece cut by measure.
You will surely not repent that because good sitting clothing is simply unpaid.
In such a customized rock you feel much better than in one of the Stange, which is always too high and resting, in the waist, etc.
Boying figures can be allowed again to wear clothing with folds, constructions, applications, embroidery or refining.
In this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to leave everything thoroughly through my head.
And yet, I'm afraid it's almost not to be created in view of the raised house task.
Each of the course participants was given a promise for which they should think about appropriate outfits - day dress and evening robbery.
We should take into account the present appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I'm supposed to attract Miranda Kerr, who might know you from the campaign Victoria's secret.
Inside I jumble, because this is far better for me personally than for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred pounds in recent times (now good, that's a bit overwhelming), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the clothing pieces from magazines or search on the Internet, print out and edit graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our whole personal style and our relationship with graphic design will then be expressed.
It is very important to reflect on the graphic side of styleing.
The stylist, however, attracts the models not only physically, but also designed the so-called product page in the journals (with concrete prescription, such as trend handbags, males, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about that.
But it's just Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture filled with information on figure types was equal to three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pocorný, by the fashion creator Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is Illusion and that a stylist should be able to utilize this.
And one-speaked stylist can work with a single dressing piece in a very different way.
The magic word is called Variability.
For example, we can wear a trunch coat like used on the Jeans, such as a T-shirt or mantel, but you can also wear it on the naked body, dressing paragraph shoes and wearing it as a dress.
It's enough to get the sleeves or the cranes high and the whole look looks quite different.
"They play," he stressed.
Most of them, however, found me the following Council: "First, you must know the rules perfectly."
"Then you need to hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally, I will see why all these teachings must be preserved, what can be combined with something and why, even if you often get quite different in fashion journals.
From fashion views to swear.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist needs to have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you need to be prepared for a Fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo looks very different in combination with other accessories at times than in reality.
So with all this you need to expect in the design of the outfit.
The image and style sometimes make the half of the success, which also confirmed Jan Pocorný.
There you only need Madonna to see a not just brilliant singer made a world star from the image and marketing.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities think this is often for cutting money (the main thing is that I bring something like I see is two-third).
And if somebody already gets a style of us, then we should expect that he or she forces us with great probability to a very different (less) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to googlen to make sure that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding promise has taken or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario insisted on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only focused on the fashion and then the outfit needs "to build together".
In his work, he must communicate primarily with the people he styles, and he must be a wiped psychologist.
People appreciate, without being insisted, and stand on his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to look at their clothing cabin and to supplement beautiful pieces, we can't clear her all the wardrobe and say - my God, that's terrible."
"One must find at least a few commendable things to which you recommend what you can wear," Mario says.
He also showed us exactly what such a "Platztasche" must include.
So a pocket that you knock on the waist and wear all the necessary proprietaries.
In addition to such clear things, such as screws, abrollers to hair or safety needles, they also contain such utensiles, such as a nylon fibre (for example, the stylist helps to photograph products such as handbags or woods), special clips with which the back of the clothing is refined if it is too large (slots or other sticks are prohibited so that the substance does not go down) and natural nutrients.
In order not only to listen but also to something practically, we learned how to clarify shoes correctly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the shoe sole, swear outward.
We slipped and we cried...
With the shear, you must not touch the shoes once so that you can't damage them.
So you really have to go for it.
Mario enjoyed me by praised my "creation" without restrictions.
The ability mentioned is not just my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we got to hear during the second weekend continuation course.
One has become clear in the meantime - to wipe the styling at professional level, is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race cross through America
Review
The original careless ride is completely avoidable by a series of dilettant errors to the early history.
Although the ambitions were largely fulfilled, what does it use, if no one seems to like to do a bit more.
Before he came to the shoptic, the new part was awakening high expectations with the subtitle "The Run".
He promised to move the already-old series of games "Nod for Speed" again a piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed not only to be one of many action races.
We were also curious as the passages corrected in which the main protagonist rises from the car and continues to foot.
But as you're already used with NFS, it's very different in the final effect as you expected.
Surely - potential are it quite adherent Arcade races, but in total the game is smiling by some overflowing errors that are present in this series more or less for a few years.
So there are no mistakes anymore, but rather signs of a principle of unfavorable faculty of the game developers.
The adventure begins very good.
First, one will be introduced into the history, whose main figure Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be participating in an illegal logic cross through America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you are at Lenkrad - with the task of being first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is carried on another route and that individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have the impression that game would always offer the same one again.
Some environments are still quite beautiful, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the drive through the desert, through herbal landscape or above through deeply shattered landscape works visually very pleasant.
In addition, untypical elements bring a little differentiation into the individual races.
In the wilderness, for example, one is surprised by a desert tower, which restricts the views strongly.
In the mountains, you need to be politely careful that you are not swept by a law.
In addition, the individual races are quite well built behind each other.
It was just a few, but they're enough.
A while you are trying to get the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have to pick up time (class races against the stop clock), then one more personal shower is expected with one single contrahent.
And there's still the police who wants to scratch the whole thing.
A news are passages where Jack leaves the car.
It's rather about some interactive animations where Jack flee somebody before and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprised, however, that there is much less such passages in the game than you would be expected (concretely only three).
Finally, this is the advantage of this thing, because this element has at least no chance to become boring - it belongs in context to the above-mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The ride model is screaming in the foottaps of the previous parts.
That means, from today's point of view, it does not erase trees, on the other hand you couldn't claim it would be bad.
If you look for realistic simulations, you need to look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded racing ride will continue to be quite justified by this driving model, although it could be better for competition.
Until then, everything's in best order.
Real problems appear after a certain time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
Of such a game, it is hard to expect that it calculates complex deformations and collisions, but if you practically don't have any object knowledge about how the car maintains, then it seems not all is okay.
Typical example: When you take a close retreat or arriving on counterfeiting cars, the other car is only easy at some points, in other, nearly identical situations, but you come into the sleuder and turning wild pirouts.
Or the carre is equal to screaming.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn't make any further, since it's all the time.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the route, then you will turn the game back to the last point of view.
Only in every race you have only five restarts.
If you have exhausted it, everything goes from front.
So the restarts are rather something like a tool, in the case that something does not succeed but should be left on it.
Sometimes, however, not even helps the restart, there is nothing else than learning out the critical section.
Explained is that the same things are often happening at the same points.
Some curves, for example, need to pass through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
In other words, you will always meet "civilen" cars in the corresponding position in the same configuration, regardless of whether you come as the first or fiveth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially angry in situations when you see that the contrahent passes from a playing on two matching cars, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you need to drive or burn them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is so designed that this situation is always close to your nose.
The contrahents have further advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always picked over the same place from the same opponent and also here again without prejudice to the time.
This is to finish the game on the long bridge that you happen in contrast.
The contrahent must evidently get out of here on the devil.
And if he's before one, then he's taking a view of a naturally, so that you start driving your car a few times in Klump there.
Clear - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it avoids the joy of the game quickly.
And this is harmful, because despite simpler driving model, the game is quite entertainable and, in fact, so doing so, that you can almost no longer know where one is the head.
And in principle, no matter what "guilty" is about it - the concepts with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of races in a way that no longer can come up, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change in cars in the course of the races.
You must not overlook the tank stations on the route, because just here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have just reached.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suitable for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight cars and exotic super sports cars for the technical riders, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (requirements) - so the races in the individual localities you know from history.
There are not only medals here, but also experience points for the own profile that are common for the tasks (requirements) and history.
To reach the higher driver level, different objects must be locked up: starting from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously linked to the autolog online function, which, among other things, compares its own results with other players and also ensures further collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible snitzers is a situation in the last race of history.
With the car you will come here into an Metro tonel (meinetways), where you are racing long on the rails in the dark.
On the Tacho looks at numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (mineways), but once from the back there comes an U-Bahn and drives a compromiseless to scratch.
In our editorial action, we will probably have been fighting about whether this was a blackout of the game designer or whether the authors think us like this.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite profound and brilliant here and there is even brilliant.
It is even more angry that in some exciting moments, the frequency of the video will slow down and this sometimes quite dramatic.
This concerns, however, the accidents with larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not use anything.
The sound playback is as far as O.K. and the sound track is taste.
In pursuing to address as wide as possible young audiences, a sound track a lá "of everybody" created - but who already buys such a game for music?
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would not be contradicted by the total unnecessary mistakes, we could have claimed with the breasttone of the conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But this way the game works somewhat unfinished.
A class of pleasure for itself, but you should be prepared to see that this error with the power of airport licensers in the eyes.

EU-Botschafter Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and euros creatures
"The Lisbon Treaty has brought the balance between the individual institutions ill-being out of the lot."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to escape."
"It will last five, six years until the wounds are glued and all of their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador in the European Union, quite sharply their lecture on the legal faculty.
As seriously as she takes the motto "sustainable and openly about Europe", she has already shown in the first part of her lecture in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such an overviewable and understandable way that they could have benefited some lecturer of the Karls University's jurisdiction.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism became loud that he was too unreasonable - a grievous official who had not grown such a role, but I must say that it has defeated all the breath, how well he accepted the matter.
"He is a man who is ready to listen patiently to seven and twenty Member States, to communicate with them and has the clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as a response to the question: Who is this? Who is this? What number should I call??", so as an important step towards the agreement and better readableness of the EU policy towards countries, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our oil-proofer quargel
Ms Vicenová also dedicated to the European Union's agenda to live and live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the summit meeting for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the presidency described it as a great negative point which has been severely harmed by the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently full of all hands.
The Ambassador stated that it was not only the Presidency but also the subsequent crisis that has not yet been overwhelmed very much.
And there is still acknowledgement of the EU’s seven-year budget, which makes things much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a small and spacious budget which will give priority to sectors which countries are more and less promoted - all this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also remembers her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels, "Restablical about Europe".
"If I don't like something, it's great shortcuts, strangers and specialists that no one understands.
In fact, I should like to know as a citizen whether we are really crowned in Brussels or round straps and different large bananas, or whether someone really wants to forbid the quargel.
She would also like to use the EU’s ground to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of the two or different speeds in the prospect
The EU Botschaftsman believes that the Czechs are called to be European creators who are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weaker representation of Czechs in European institutions is thus more angry.
There are many factors of debt, including the retaining of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Please believe me when a Pole or Hungary comes to me and is a Slovak near, then the Franzose says next to me: "He, what's your heads together - is that already your V4?" and there's a pretty sacred miene.
Ms Vicenové, in the future, the EU expects particularly hard rules for the budget policy of the Member States.
As much real, as a "European Federation", she looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro area and the countries apart from the euro area.
"We have the Schengen room and we already have the institution of strengthened cooperation."
"First, it was said that only the countries who want to work together and those who do not want it should be quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will lastly go beyond a strong Europe of different speeds," Mrs Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcement of the principle that all topics have to be discussed by all Member States throughout the EU and not only by the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters into the second century of his existence
If you were looking for an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM is most characterized as well, this would well be the word "Lang life".
For the broad public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although since its founding has already been a century.
The basis for this long-lasting has already put her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he entrusted the Slogan, countless global problems were easy to solve when people were ready to think a little.
His Slogan "Think!" became a brand mark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the firmsintern magazine, which we started to release at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis for the business culture prepared by Wats.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also a whole century successful, because it remained faithful to its principles and did not scare back to change all other rings.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society throughout our first century.
We hope we create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company from the occasion of the Jubilee.
Monitored system
Whatson has already operated in the thirty years of social care of his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur in the Czechoslovakia: the IBM lessons had been paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as a job dress and a thoughtful discharge system for best new and traders.
Similarly, the long-term relationships of IBM with their customers have also been clashed.
The company was invented as one of the first companies around the world from the beginning of genial in talent promotion, and was able to look forward to any discrimination.
In accordance with this antidiscrimination strategy, the current plan, which is also changed by a woman by Virginia Romtty at the top of IBM in the next year.
It has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she took the position of Vetriebs, Marketing and Strategy Chief.
IBM makes so-called online brainstorms in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - ideas are enough, the company is almost half a million people busy.
An institution with good reputation
Their inevitable position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this after inside and outside.
"In the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps to solve business problems with technology," added George Colony from Consulting-Firma Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logo for family "Big Blue", has grown to one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product wide - from servers to nanotechnology.
All American technology companies have most patents and five of his employees have been awarded by the Nobel Prize.
Its most well-known inventions include, for example, banking machines, credit cards, financial swap, line code or the diskette.
This year, IBM was the second largest technology company (also in Apple), with about 220 billion dollars of stock exchange value (mark capitalisation) while Microsoft overridden for the first time since 1996.
Looking forward
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today - unfortunately, for example, the attempt with its own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so don't be emotionally bound to the past," Samuel J. Palmisano says.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its basic walls on various platforms - and if they don't work to leave them again.
In contrast to the competitor Microsoft, who stands and falls in principle with its Windows operating system.
Promising technologies
The profits of IBM take part in most of the services, software and hardware.
In 1990 hardware was represented with a more than fifty percent share of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has made little profitable assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in future technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008 when the modern financial crisis fought over the world for the first time as a storm.
Here too, IBM remained faithful to his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment capacity in the middle of the major world economy crisis.
So far it seems that the company IBM is unschaded about today's crisis.
The value of IBM activity has risen by 120 percent since 2008 and the purchasing of the company grows continuously.
The IBM company log is: everything can be changed - only the values are not.
It is also necessary to expect that this flexible gigant also masters the next crisis.
IBM History: From cheeseneider to world-all flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded a hundred years ago in New York had a very complex name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over only 1924 - originally a brand description for a office in Canada and South America.
The basic stone to the later society IBM put the merger of four companies whose history was returned to the 80s of the 19th century.
They included technologies such as the famous stech card tubes for registration of the work start and end.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who also had the chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint, who set up the Chief of the Competitor Thomas J. Watson to help him with the management of the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadow - on Watson's ideas based on whatson's ideas until today the unforgettable culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, started, as already the name suggests, with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade – from worst and cheese cutters, up to bags.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and expanded the company to all continents.
Whatson was so indispensable for the company that he had been sitting in the Chiefsessel for 40 years, until then he was dissolved by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under it, IBM started working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first program language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers helped IBM to lead flights to the whole of the NASA - the Merkur and Saturn and the famous human flight to the moon in 1969.
In 1964, IBM developed the first host family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC, which set the computer standard for that time, came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM made up his computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand she bought the consultant part of the PricewaterhouseCooper company and went into the business with consulting services and services with great added value.
The strategy that IBM pays out over the last three years is the concept "Smarter Planet".
It emphasizes the intention of use of technologies in some areas which have not yet been planned, e.g. to improve the situation in the transport and urban administration.
In the trade sector, IBM has recently launched the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which should help distributors to guide the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM founded a branch in the Czechoslovakia - as a first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brünn.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-level research team, which is the technology of vote identification.
Darina Rychtářová about their unfaithful holes:
Iveta - You can keep this donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now's final!
After her wife Joseph Rychtář (53) was become a lover from Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still kept the hope that Joseph was awaited from his rosa Red dream and came home.
But now it is final with patience and for further life it has set itself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no longer than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová was commanded by the singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she wouldn't even be in the dream as it was with her husband.
When Iveta retired after 30 days and moved back to \íčany, Joseph went right away.
Yes, he even publicly knew that he loved them.
With the time, Darina resigned, yes, even as if she wanted to reconcile her unfaithful husband, but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytá-- it doesn't matter who his wife sleeps.
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will surely not receive open arms.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not challenge him."
"Of course not as a lover old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have some bonds," Mrs. Rychtářová said, but she also said that she already had emotionally separated from him and only devoted to mutual independence.
The fact that Darina has disinfected him the back door, Joseph has to be dignified.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing is changing."
"My wife wants a paper before and I respect."
"The company continues, I care about the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina, I'm quite normal, only we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he wouldn't want to prevent them from it.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who's this.
I know that this is my guilt, I loved myself in Iveta and therefore I take any responsibility.
The worst female disadvantages: What is it with you?
If you encourage the men to call some typical female insults, then they shake outlessly some instantly out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognise in the following lines, in which we can pass a few unseen revolvementes that let the men wall the blood in the Aderns?
Purchase
Does they prefer to be a buying?
Should you buy at least one Hader weekly?
Do you like to go shopping and may it be even a little more in the case of actions?
Then it's really a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least aware of it and try to control their shopping desire halfways.
But hand to the heart, what woman does it already pretend to test on the search for a well-suited upper dress only through a dress business and not all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times they said to her husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Sustainable satisfaction
"I don't be too thick?"
"I should take up at least five pounds - I should start jogging or making gymnastic?"
"I'll fall to you at all?"
Does that happen somehow known to them?
Yeah?
Then you may also be among the women who are regularly occupied of what they look like.
That doesn't long says that you should go, but many men react allergicly to it when her wife constantly sorrys her appearance.
The stronger gender is unanimous - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are always indifferent.
Order and cleanliness in first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Fold windows, tiles and dusts, shooting the wake - and this at least twice a week.
Simplish with her partner, because he is trampled again with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you shake the children because the just smelled washbeck is already terrible and because the glass door has already fingerprints on the living room, where yet the polaring makes so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of 'deviance', you should know that nothing can be transmitted and the order and cleanliness of family life is not at first.
This measureless purity fimmel can also harm mutual relations and, above all, rest in the family.
Tiles
"Happy tourhosen come into the laundry basket."
"Will you really attract the old socks tomorrow?"
"A wet handwich doesn't just throw on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a Tirade, you should not wonder that it brings it to the palm.
Clearly this isn't bad meant, they just want all that has his order.
When the men knew this, the women may not have to melt so much.
Clay and Tract
Some women clown and like to join, there's been chickened behind the back or even slumbered or smelled bounds.
Women are now focused on relations, so they like to go through such topics, such as - who, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us has a little harmless cloth and tratsch on camp.
Hand to the heart - that's probably all women's own.
However, this is not to change with clothingst calibers, who are nothing and nobody holy, who is probably despised to everyone in their surroundings and, especially, a significant danger for women collectives.
Jágr and Voráček half Philadelphia with their assistances for victory
The Eishockey Turmer Jaromír Jágr had a large share in the ice at the ice in Carolina at the Monday game of the NHL with two assists on the 5-3-sea of Philadelphia and is again productively Czech players in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistence and was called out to the best player of the Matche.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's competitor Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed after the game of journalists that Giroux had a great evening prophesie.
"Show before the game, I tell him that he is able to get a Hattrick today."
I had somewhat in feeling."
"Hin and again get such a feeling," said Jágr, after his action, Giroux had already reached a gate at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later also had the second results "a Czech trace".
Voráček was struggling behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented him between the circles to the successful max Talbot.
A second before the receipt of the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer reached a short hand, but the second third was again the Flyer.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he achieved his third hits, and then Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he is the best player of the Liga, but he certainly belongs to the best three," Jágr würdiged his center.
"I wouldn't be aware that I play together with such a iceockey player as with him at the end of my career."
"That's awesome to me."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL, my competitors put their game on me and now the spider turns around," Jágr murmured.
Carolina made play for the drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who went through a criminal office, it came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in overnumber two against one.
"Excellently acted prongers still in our zone."
"He faded the puck, I took up and (read) moved to more distant phospits."
"I tried to meet him and am glad that it had been folded," preáček described the last match of the party from his view.
Due to this victory, Philadelphia went to the top of the eastern conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured in the game against Buffalo, and in the second third, shaking the upper body injured.
In addition to her experience, the canal service also busted their leadership in the penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the criminals was unable to change Tomáš Placeanec.
More than the lost points, the trainer of the crew probably pained the high disease-related loss in the defensive - the game played only with five defense players.
"That's bad."
"The encounter we played only with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to do so we need to finish," said Jacques Martin.
"For every change, a wave of attack after the other one, and we had nothing against it."
"We had to make the game easier and bring the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here", said P. K. Subban, one of the players.
The Czech Torhüter Ondřej Pavelec refused thirty shoots from Tampa Bay and contributed to the 5-2-Sieg over Winnipeg.
On the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five precipitations, five different shelters were shared.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five government travel offices in the ČSSR at that time: Čedok, athletes, CKM, Ccreea and Autoturist.
The travel offices were sold above all to travel to the Eastern Block countries, in the West only to choose.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the East Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Shi on the Peninsula Krim on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when you were allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a prosperous course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were strongly restricted.
A large paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the East Block (also the Czechoslovaks) to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizens of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a such invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
At that time the travel offices also offered travel offices to the west, but they had to buy huge snakes or also stay in the sleeping bag before the travel office, or at least "good knowing" in the travel office.
So, too, the thing has not been running for a long time.
The so-called devisage - the condition for a tour to the west - was only granted "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czech currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, therefore, without devisory commitment it would have been impossible to drive the necessary financial funds (west currency) for a journey to the west.
The most Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates – a habit that lasts until today.
The joint revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs at the foot.
While a holiday in the DDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign vacations in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which is no longer conscious today, is the fact that there was no travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia to 1989 because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
As from the beginning of the 90s of the past century, devising obligations were repealed into the neighbouring Western European countries, which resulted in a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakia could simply not get enough from their journeys to the west for long time, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
The Czech holidays were so sleeping in the park when traveling to Paris, because they had already had the money for a accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature in the foreign trips of Czechs was then a full-packed case room with conservation, beer and permanent worst.
A further important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech Krone - after decades our tourists could finally buy the western currency free.
Our level of life and thus also the average keepers increased, which came in 1997 in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demands for travel, the travel offices began to prepare regular travel by charter flights after 1997, allowing flights to negotiate incredibly incredible compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, with the exception of the United States, the Czech Republic had already devisitless payments with all high-developed world countries, making travel easier.
At another interesting moment in the history of the "post-seated" travel traffic it came in 2000, thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, every year, direct charter flights fly with Czech passengers in far-reaching solar countries; this year you are flying directly from Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
Every year to the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
A further important moment in the epoch that marked our "postrevolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17th, 2008, the United States raised the visa duty for Czech tourists, making our country definitively under the highly developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs first spent more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%) and first in their history gave them for a single holiday stay including the costs at the holiday site more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head.
The General Assembly is to find a new president - and again a Patt threatens.
For almost five months, the Czech football has not been chaired by the president and threatened that the successor of Ivan Hašek will not even be known at the top of the Czech football association (FAČR) after the extraordinary main meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is no agreement until today on which the voting regulation should be chosen.
And without this, there is no vote about the three potential followers possible.
Three interested people want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek returned from his function, calling for his colleagues to find some and a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only in the era to Hašek, the old crossings broke again between the two association chambers, which cannot be able to take part in a common candidate.
This was shown by stonep and clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People's House at the Prague Quarter Smíchov because the negotiation led to no result and there was not only the choice itself.
It is not even possible that some who are actually voting for the complete collection - only the steady representatives or the functionary equipped with a full power.
At least partial agreement in this single point, which also contributed to the Recommendation of the State and Law Institute, whose opinion was not in full power.
However, the disputes on the voting regulation continue to take place.
The Executive Committee also did not make any clarity in the matter, in whose meetings - regardless of whether ort ortainable or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the opinions regarding the choice changed a few times, the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is, how should one take place in the 3nd rounds to avoid a Patt situation?
"The dispute concerns whether to deal with the statute, or whether a different model must be found," stated Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who acted in the management of the professional football.
According to steady model, in the third round of the candidate who receives greater percentage support in the chamber for which he candidates.
Mährers are supposed to be ready to take into account the compromise that the candidate wins the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, again, consists of the condition that the winner receives at least a double-drittel majority at this percentage vote.
"The two front rounds have no sense anymore, this mode would question the entire two chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objects of the male side, which best finds it not to add the electoral order, but to choose according to valid statute.
It is surprising that Tomáš Paclík agrees, even though it is noted that the steady electoral order of all candidates meets Pelta.
"My wish is that it is widely chosen after the statute."
"To this end, no inconspicuous replacement variants, as in the last General Assembly," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeć, who first qualified and restricted itself in his opinions mainly to Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
His opinion is that Nymburk will be known to the new chairman in Nymburk, and he believes that candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The potential qualification of the national team for the soccer-EM today would certainly contribute to the rest of the mind."
"If the soccer is only traveling at the euphoric wave, then also the willingness to collaborate is greater," says Jablonec functionary, who brings the greatest experience of all three Adeptes and this at professional and regional level.
Rajchl's back there.
"I hope an agreement, but the situation is unfortunate."
"This is not a matter between the people of bohems and mummies, but there are some efforts to "require" the rules for their own purposes.
"For this reason, again blocking is not excluded at the General Assembly."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human understanding last wins," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to accept all sides is no longer.
Some negotiations should be supposed to play directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the soccergency will be complete until the skills game is at all.
The charter plane, with which, among others, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague because of a technical disturbance, so you were looking for a substitute variant as to bring part of the Exekutive Committee to the location of the Barrage Heinplay.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level is crucial to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Joseph Dobeš, the Minister for Schools, Youth and Body Education, would like to move the divided parties within the largest sports association of the country to a agreement.
There is much on the game: state uses, confidentiality of the Czech football and also the ČSTV's main meeting, which should show the new direction for Czech sports following the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is fighting for the President's position because he does not see appropriate candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the Chief of the Pilsner Soccer, could have made a strong candidate before the extraordinary General Assembly, who had fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Republic Football Football Association (FAČR), he would not have left himself at all on the fight for this top position.
"If it would be a good lawyer, then I would fight for him and leave the choice."
"But in the present situation it was not possible to find such an adept," Paclík ČTK said.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, so it is to prevent the supposed favorites of the election, Pelta, to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the case of his victory he remembers the function of the chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the appointment of the core General Assembly.
In the position of the chairman he would like to have seen an experienced Top Manager who is not too much in the football events.
"With some people in question, I have spoken personally."
"To believe that some told me that they weren't currently trying to identify with the Czech football.
"Sole views would like to have changed," he suggested.
Most of all, Paclík assumes that the connection of Pelta with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, which is considered to be a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegated agreements on main meetings.
For Paclík it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta had the position of the President.
"By his victory, today's state would be preserved, and in Czech football it wasn't at all ahead."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, was subject to a double bad football", stressed Paclík.
He also noted that Pelta's name was some time ago in connection with telephone hearings for the investigation in a corruption army, but was free of punishment from the Pelta.
"I don't know what Prestige should bring a victory of Pelta to the football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Michiganecl Paclík, who said his former statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club, when Pelta becomes chairman," yet something more.
However, if Paclík was vigorous in the Thursday election, he could present himself a future cooperation with Pelta.
In the same way, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the General Assembly in October, who ended with a Fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would go."
"He has great capabilities."
"I could well imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to guide the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters of which I don't understand," said Paclík, who had been able to look forward in September, that he was replaced by the suspension of the Schiedsgerichte Commission with Luǒěk Macela at the top, the Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he is growing up the role of the association chairman.
And he is calling on his skills in the management of private firms since last summer he is also head of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the Liga with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"To limit the influence of certain stakeholders, which tend to influence disciplinary and occupational commissions, which are experiencing in distressful situations," paclík suggested, who does not make heal from his antipathy, for example, against the Sparta-Chef Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he observed the solidarity of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Commission, with which he would help the political top politicians to lobby more money from the lottery tax into sports.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote".
"If it comes to taxation of gambling games, as the political parties declare, then I grip her argumentation, but they also have to be stonep and clearly say where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club does not also look at Paclík as a handicap, although he itself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "transpartial".
Pelta again is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not really ideal."
"It doesn't make my opinion much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third-party person to return to some other half years," Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will expire a Patt-Situation in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chair, namely Miroslav Pelta, he will make himself strong in the event of his choice that the FAČR will receive new statutes that are exclusion of disputes on the presidency regulation in the future.
The functionary of Jablonec is confidential before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will be safely deteriorated in a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the non-realized election in September to focus on the national team and the profit of financial resources in the case of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last General Assembly, so the two-month break allowed him to help defend his ideas about the lead of the football and present in a broader context.
"Leading at all levels devote itself to the soccer, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to know on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is guided by someone, the man who is primarily connected with the Jablonec club, but who also acted for many years with Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience in order to guide the Czech football.
He is convinced that for today’s problems with the choice the Euphorie, which was in the times of Ivan Hašek.
"Leiders were approved at the General Assembly in June statutes that were not as perfect as they were all accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we had already had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
The revision of the most important document of the civil union was used as a locking tool for the delegates.
"If I be chairman, then I accept it personally and am ready to wear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a principleal thing without which he cannot be," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to limit his contrahents.
Earlier he had announced that he could introduce cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, who he acknowledges for his legal education and knows well that his opponent would be his first representative.
Tomáš Paclík also did not attack for a long time, which left no dry fade on Pelta again.
In the soccer, he already moves over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
"His attacks were, however, devastating and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Then, therefore, many doubts about his real character," Pelta addressed his contradictor who probably remained faithful to his proclamations that he has already said in September.
His strongest weapon is the knowledge of the soccer from the lower games classes, to the national team.
And this should be the pencil of Czech soccer balls.
"I would also strive to finish all the affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the seeds of the corruption scandal last year."
"According to onderhandelingen with the private and state sector, I would be able to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the six-fifty-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleanings.
"I had to get to know with the working content of all employees only once," he said towards Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is a profound nerve.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the next main meeting, he believes that the delegates do not go to Nymburk on Thursday.
"If really the only strike point should be as you choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The soccer needs credibility, and it only wins back by being a new Leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possible decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts to work hard under him
If, on the Thursday General Assembly, the former vice-president Jindřich Rajchl should be elected to the new president of the Czech Republic’s football federation, many people in the association would probably miss the laune.
Rajchl promises that you start working hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual soccer areas.
In addition, he promised the case of Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the soccer and, otherwise, continue the work that began by the previous president Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I want to wipe the soccer as a whole."
Beginning from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, professional football, to the performance football for the youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the competences in the Exekutive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the soccer will progress with milessteps in each segment."
Many would not be disappointed because, instead of criticizing the work of others, they should now really start working hard for themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the soccer movement, it has considered to no longer be able to.
"I know that I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who don't throw me unreasoned knoble between the legs and question any step I am doing," he said as a statement why he had sweared.
"But many people told me that I didn't give up because it would do others else."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
Apparently he also motivates to continue his work under Hašek.
"In two years we have managed a big piece of work and I don't want to just throw away now."
"There have been launched processes that may only come into a few years and I would only see that they stop someone," he said and thus expressed his concerns that in case of the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would choose to return the situation to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that is something that Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"Hinter him stands above all people who would make the soccer so that he would only be there for exalted."
I can do some things, but I don't think I'm participating.
"I am trying to be objective."
"I want soccer for everyone, because it's all going well and not just the chosen," Rajchl observed.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a president of the Czech Republic.
"Ask if some people claim the opposite, I really have to do the best possible for males."
"For example, it is time to consider whether you should not distribute the Liga into a Czech and a nutritional part whose winners then risen to the first Liga."
"Then it could not happen that today only three malicious clubs play in the Liga, which is particularly a problem for young players in male," says Rajchl.
Because now the Chief of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the fight for the function of the chairman, Rajchl does not trust to estimate his chances that he is chosen.
"I felt strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to their deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes stand behind me," rajchl also suggested the saving of twenty million crowns for unprofit agreements, the agreement of television agreements and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he partially blame that the association does not strike a single step.
While he says of Pelta, "he was disqualified by before to help the Czech football to rely," he thinks the second Rivalen - Paclík for a strong candidate who has really offered the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he was chosen, he would probably continue the things which Ivan Hašek initiated, and also the personal occupation in the Commissions, he would evidently not change in principle."
He surely wouldn't want things to go down to his favours," judged Rajchl about his rivals.
Europe’s most beautiful Polish
Bubble to the Blue
By Julia Stanek
Plantbecks in Ufo-Optic, Prunkpools in Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience its blue miracle - and, after a city tour or hiking, rest the tired legs in sprout baths.
A book shows where Wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip over the last one and a half years, one could not miss in her bag: their bathing approximation.
She looked high in artificially designed caves, swimed marble pumps that waited for them on the basin edge, and stared over acrybianly restored youth style swimming halls.
She enjoyed a bath, took it up flights into her notebook - as well as knowledgeful details about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 swimming baths investigated architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presented it in her book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore-Betonbauten" in Taunus.
She led her "reise to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" through 13 countries: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and each a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiastin.
With sports they don't have much at the hut, Meder - just in the water is that different.
Worstly only that swimming fans have to be found with blue tiles and chlorides, while Jogger can breathe the disturbing fragrance of fight forests or bird wizards in the park.
"I asked one day why swimming baths must always be so harmful," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"I also started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Pleasurers in the lounge and athetic sauna oil - the wellness factor in baths is so large because all senses are used, says Meder.
And if the builders have made effort, swimming halls can be a true eye-face: "Satt of a floor you have a water surface in baths."
"They is transparent on the one hand, but, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high wool, colored tiles, jumpboards.
The small-formated image band "Badefreuden" gives information on 190 pages about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but especially makes it a joy to a jump into the blue.
The Polish-Sammler Meder discovered remarkable copies in her accounts in Hungary.
In addition to the 100-year-old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest, she found a nitrately water in a surrounded carsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose baskets are filled with alkaline water and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, spectacular views offer many heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in the eye of the Zurich Dachbad, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool in St. Anton and: In the steam pool there is a window where you can watch the brewery on the ski piste.
The most exceptional pool design may expect bathing guests in long field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a just landed Ufo in the Alps.
From three to top open scales it damps in winter, while in the background the mountains of the oeztal rising into heaven.
Alhambra in Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the Polish sammer Meder of the smell of Chlor went to the nose.
Many thermal baths are calling for sulphur, in the Árpád bas in the Hungarian Békescsaba it is so strong to heat oil that you hardly believe to be landed in a health pool.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenic carbonately healing water that is almost black and its sleeves on the skin as soon as you can go into the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
On one place Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing sites: when she wanted to visit the free and sunbad in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrace.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic was now closed in 1902.
When Meder threw a glance through the wounded windows of the red-white yellow youth style, she saw how unkraut between the tiles grown.
On the other hand, the loss has been inflicted in a beautiful swimming pool in the Black Forest: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three construction phases have already been behind this bathroom; not only neoromanic elements that come from times of construction in 1844 but also a maurial hall in the Alhambra style, which was added by 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of the Polish-Kennerin Iris Meder - and this is not just because it is originally from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to melt different design styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, the diving in the thermal pool is apparently only an additional case.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank allows raw material gases to be bleached
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up their business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann has assigned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January the Chief of the Group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of the Germans are not acceptable according to a study that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the interviews even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions rise out of this business because it enhances the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on a report presented in the middle of October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets of the global raw material stocks drive the prices up – and the banks are therefore carrying a co-debt of the global famine problem.
The campaign of consumer guardians is directed against Deutsche-Bank-Chef Joseph Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw materials laws were intended to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the Zockers have disconnected from supply and demand - and do at the worst cost.
In contrast to the US competitors, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to check the prerequisites and said that no business is "valued to set the good reputation of the German Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the prerequisites from the Foodwatch report.
Until the end of the year, the test will be completed, then the results will be presented to the Board of the German Bank, as well as the recommendation to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank's top wants to tell what consequences it draws.
At the end, a reduction of raw materials could be possible, or even the complete deduction.
Ackermann basts on his image
Foodwatch-Chef Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism at the financial sector: "The bet on increasing food prices is particularly dramatic, how deceptively banks are harming the general place today."
Ackermann now is the top bank lobbyist in particular.
"The Deutsche Bank has to scatter all the plants from their portfolio where money is used at food prices," said Bode.
"Even if Mr. Ackermann is about hunger suffering or about the call of the German Bank."
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Chief of the Group wants to give a perfect picture for a few months before the office exit.
On Monday, the German Bank announced that the Chief of the Board will not change to the Supervisory Board other than planned.
With a deportation of the entrepreneurly agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible influences he hard to swallow, so he would have to do his followers at last.
Each second would announce raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30.000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
Just once 11 percent therefore think it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers plants that are used for food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learn that their banks participated in such businesses: each second would suspend the survey of all plants in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 per cent would rate renunciations from such a bank, 49 per cent, thought about an account and switching to another institution.
21er House in Vienna
The surrounding pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
Architecture history with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition pavillon of Brussels in 1958 gained prices, became a museum in Vienna, standing empty and obtained.
Now he's being opened again as an exhibition house.
When weakened by modern afterwar architecture, clear forms, glass halls, muddy sweats and new construction materials typically for faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavillon of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brüssler World Exhibition 1958 is a fitting and famous example.
Schwanzers Pavillon at that time received the Grand Prix d'architecture for its light and sweating steel glass construction.
The construction is considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture until today.
He made the architects known so that he also built in the next world exhibition of Austria's Pavillon.
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus committee-like sidebuilding in Munich, he was finally famous internationally in 1973.
The pavilion planned as a temporary exhibition was established after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Railway Station, rebuilding and opening a museum of the 20th century in 1962 - the "20s House" was called it.
Gignet was the building but not spacious and technical as a museum - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
Yet it was used so long until the contemporary art in Vienna received a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now, the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the pavilion, now called "21's house" and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Museum of Belvedere, which belongs to the house, opens the first exhibition - a case of luck in every respect.
The newly started Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted art historian with respective career, among other things in the youth as an ice art course, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of the Modern Salzburg, surrounded the reconstruction with politicians and monument guards, provided public means and private sponsors and set the use.
In addition to present art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the same name foundation, a café and a bookload should be available, and a office house had to be built.
Strong Supervisory, Small Eat
Then Krischanitz was the ideal place for the implementation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's second session was sensitively transformed and extended and gained competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was a "unintelligent important place" for which he saw the exhibitions "fast every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building that already lost in his suspension to Vienna and his use of greatness and lightness.
During the present transformation there were much larger problems: the building was "a energy runner," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade have been alternated, used glass fiber strengthened isolier glass and replaced the glass roof by special safety glass.
Cold bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestofilled ceilings have been sanated.
Two substrates brought place for the new use, a declining light grab between house and street ensures the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the light tailor pavillon.
The original outdoor doors are staying, the house is stripped in the old red brown red color.
And the cinema is even quite exactly as he was before.
And all of this under strict supervision of the monumental authority and with small estimation.
"Oft had to be found a material that is good and cheap and also like the Memorial Protection Office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough soil in the substrate.
Despite all twins, problems and reconstructions, the building has been flexible and easy to stay.
There was difficulty with the pavilion, "who came from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City story".
Thus an architecture stands "every in the wrong place" and still wants to arouse "a proper consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21nd house is not in the wrong place, because it is a city-building case of happiness: To the Swiss garden around, the entirely newly planned "Main Stationsquartier", with office and housing homes.
And another case of luck may still occur: The 21st house could get reinforced by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and as you hear, it has already negotiated with the city around a neighborhoodal location in the Swiss garden.
Train plant winter crisis package in million height
The railway has designed a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
According to this year, in the fight against winter-related tractor losses and delays, the Deutsche Bahn provides over 70 million euros in addition to this year.
The "image" newspaper reported prior to calling on a group-internal crisis plan until 2015 investments of around 300 million euros were provided.
This aims to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks also in extreme whiteness.
Among other things, the internal and external employees are planned to disrupt the snow on railway stations and train climbs to 16.000 people.
The aim is to free rail-steige until the start of operation and 90 percent of operational weeklys within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago Bahn-Chef Rüdiger Grube had warned after a top meeting with government and industry before tractors and delays in this winter.
Last winter, the railway had significant problems in the traffic of passengers, as it was, among other things, lack of reserves in difficult weather conditions.
Thus many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorisation from the railway Federal Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE tariffs.
The railway has also made it for years that they have to make axes more frequently in the workshop after a ICE at the Cologne Main Station had an asset.
German Bank pays million penalties in the USA
After the Tumult around the head of Joseph Ackermann, new uncommon comes from the United States: The Deutsche Bank has to pay a million buses there.
As if the problems were not already enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry is still taking up its past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison of EUR 145 million to add disputes because of the plague of five large co-financing banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The NCUA financial market regulator presents a number of large banks to have conveyed the joint banks with false promises for the purchase of financial products; they would have played the risks.
Such papers lost during the financial crisis are strongly valued and the banks are in deepness.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the issue without leaving the parties before the court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not confer blame with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citi Group, which has been required to pay 20.5 million dollars.
Debbie Matz, NCUA chairman, welcomed the adventure of the two coins.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. community banks and is launched in Pleiten to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to be replaced by the mallified damages.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also prevailed other large banks and accused in summer JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The hypothetic papers in question are called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are underlying house credits.
When the U.S. mobile blossom was held in 2007, this became a lot of financial firms for defect.
In September 2008, at the highest point of the financial crisis, the U.S. Investmentbank Lehman Brothers killed.
Even if the events have been lost for a few years, the banks are currently wearing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made numerous complaints to receive reimbursements or to avoid misunderstanding.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest complaint wave.
It presents 18 international large banks to have transmitted the two US real estate financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to mortgage operations in volume of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to put a complaint of the FHFA, which is the value of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires that the Frankfurters stand just for "substantial losses", but not to mention a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims without delay and explained to refuse.
Warren Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Financing guru Buffett invests strongly in IT company IBM.
Since March he has purchased shares in value of more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies only causes bad prognoses.
But now he has read the IBM business reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM has mainly provided services and computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a cater for the financial world.
Accordingly, the IT original IBM can now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed in the US Economic CNBC that he had bought IBM acts in value of 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway has risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a percentage of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM knew something about the commitment.
He praised the management, which even had been in the economic crisis for good profits.
"You have made a great job," Buffett said on the strategy.
IBM has been focusing on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of account centres.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful business computers.
Buffett had technology companies to date rather missed.
He says that he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett took part in a freight-driven train, in a mechanical manufacturer or machine-builders.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway has a number of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back, in addition to about 80 own daughter companies.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and developed it to one of the most valuable companies in the world with clever investments.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
It is therefore a cul-figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unthinkable sense for money has brought him to the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the Buffett investment was known, the IBM act predominantly increased by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth over $220 billion at the stock exchange, together with Apple and Microsoft as the most valuable technology company in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said he wouldn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is vigorous
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell" doubts that Turkish media are in the German state of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blood ideology", which now re-learse.
The murders of eight Turkish strokes and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a legal extremistic background.
This message will respond with anxiety and anxiety in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
For many German doors, a longest believed person returnes: Since the fire attacks in Mulln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more similar violence with right extremist background against doors.
The fact that there is hostility in Germany has never been in question.
However, the detected right-extremistic network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet available.
"Are back up the bloody ideology?" titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the "Sabah" newspaper stresses that one of the daders should have been a V-Man of Constitutional Protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the legal radical fluctuation.
In particular, the Turkish municipality of Germany responded: she remembered the victims of racist violence in the weekend with a wake before the Brandenburg gate.
First two weeks before, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a festival of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish contract.
In joyful colors, it was inszenated each other as a story of success.
Like an ear festivity, since the reporting of some Turkish media: "German gift to the Fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hurriyet" is also unable to take this thoughtful connection.
"It begins to stink," says the Column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people were murdered, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
First criticism is discussed in German Turkish Internet Forums the police' action and their later success.
Why the German authorities were not already much more pleased to look for suspects in legal exremistic circles, the authors are admired.
At least one shows rhetoric to drastic means: "We continue to sleeve here, the migrants will remain nothing else than self-defense and arms."
"They will probably be the best self-protection."
"From the goodness of clarifying and thoroughness of punishment of the whole network, the inner peace in Germany depends very strongly," writes "seele".
What it means if inner peace in Germany is in danger, explains the attacks of male and solingen in the nineties.
The photo of Solingen fireruns is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event, the doors living here showed more clearly that there is a tremendous threat, and the Germans that wrongdoing and distance could be in right violence.
However, the attacks sharpened the Wire feelings on Turkish side.
Do not repeat the past errors
In the Turkish press, the failure of German policy was particularly breached after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of malls.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a substitute to the Turkish President, but was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at that time in his speech, as many charges were offered by the doors.
In fact, the value of a man according to the level of his tax charges is reflected.
The current reporting of the Turkish media again shows how deeply the infringement of many German Turks is in this state of law.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive enlargement and reassessment of the legal extreme terrorism in Germany, this time open words need.
The Scandal Bank of the Zürisee
The most absent bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt and slandered from a crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
That's why Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular finish from the top of the Bundesbank, in July he was known that he would enter a almost spectacular new job in 2013: Director of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland whether her beauty and the UBS were of her newly gained solidity and made friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the tournaround".
"I am looking forward to collaboration with Caspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would come quite different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had surrounded all bank security systems and defeated about EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS Chief Oswald Grübel, one not only in Switzerland's famous banker, had to go.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS is also considered attacked - and all questions: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It was already known that Weber may advise the bank from February 2012.
And the Board of Directors already takes over in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
It's hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, instead of economic professor and note bankers and had certainly needed a working time.
He then takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has proved once again that it deserves the title "greatest Scandal Bank of Europe".
Because the UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the world's largest property manager - and, on the other hand, slandered from one scandal in the next years.
Nothing, so it seems, the once so proud Swiss bank is disparting.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also exhausted Swiss property managers had combined with ambitious goals: it also wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
Thus, the UBS managed more money in 2007 than any other bank in the world, on the one hand, with 1.6 billion dollars.
On the other hand, she was a investment bank in the Liga of the world's largest banks.
That's what's been impressed.
The one-fold banker and later bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "My students at that time I have always set the UBS as a pattern of a good bank."
"With today you ask yourself, how could I just mislead myself?"
He's wrong.
In 2007, it was revealed that somewhat much was in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, director Peter Wuffli came back surprisingly, who became a highly intellectual and also gentle banker.
A few months later, he knew why he had gone.
The bank's investment savings had diluted subprime papers and had to write billions.
In order to train, the UBS announced an increase in capital and wrote 13 billion francs.
To that end, she found investors, however, who, about which some had yet been in the nose before, had been an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund that was so silent that one could not even learn his name.
But that was only the first hit.
In April 2008 it came worse.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, in 2006, still the second most paid Board of Directors of Switzerland.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: The UBS had to be saved by the state in view of its lack of investment in the financial crisis.
The National Bank purchased the UBS for 80 billion problematic securities, the Swiss Eidgenossenship gave six billion francs for a forced change bond which they could become co-eigentaining the bank.
The entire Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it stores so large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphics).
"Only we couldn't save the UBS," says Bankenforscher Geiger.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months after that, the UBS created in the tax conflict with America and declared ready to issue the data of the ability of customers that might have deducted taxes from the bank.
In addition, she agreed to pay for $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these shops as well as penalties.
Thus, the UBS knew more or less open to have helped tax discharge.
At the same time, she lost something that has ever been their capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of the Differency.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the withdrawal of the Chief Board and the Board of Directors.
And the Exodus of Customer Dealers.
So within few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: the investment banking through the lack of speculations and capital management through the aid for tax discharge.
And just as it became somewhat more quiet, just as you thought, the UBS will get it back now, following this unsafe dealer story: A single dealer is exposing €1.7 billion before the bank notices that something goes wrong.
And it seems that the risk management in the investment banking does not seem to work.
"With the case of Adoboli, you must have found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economic and Financial Professor at the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of UBS is that it does not handle risk control."
It was exactly the idea of caution with which Swiss bankers had arrived long ago to become guardians of the world's great wealth: no too large risks to make money safe – even beyond the Alpine Republic could break the world together.
The Tresore of the Swiss Banks had become a symbol of inevitable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for special noble chocolate.
The Central of the UBS in Zurich still fits the clish of the envy Swiss private bank - it is just a bit larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters at the Zurich Train Station Street, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Sea, which is surrounded by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the store rentals belong to the highest in Europe.
You will find jewellery like Tiffany's here between Swiss tradition businesses like the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Since centuries, the Swiss banks are retired here: from the National Bank via the Portal of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy turn door.
The walls are marble clothed, which stands thick leather cell, next to the bank logo, a great sign of the "Safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss Grand Banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometime disrupted - or betrayed how the Chief finds a small Swiss private bank.
His name does not rather want to read in the newspaper, he eventually makes like all Swiss bankers, also with the two large banks shops.
The UBS had become much too large, he finds - especially in the investment banking, where the fishing axis had expanded.
The Swisss had nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted the seeds of the fishing saxes."
In fact, it was the German investment banking that changed the UBS, deteriorated its high profits and then the debakel: No European financial institution has lost much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the largest rescue in the history of its nation," writes the author Lukas Hassig in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros allowed politicians to save the large bank in front of the bankrott.
How could it come?
Speaking with Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined a huge group.
It created a bank that was too large for the small Switzerland - and continuing to grow.
As a result, the two different preliminary banks of the UBS added: a rich but sleeping bank with the focus of assets management in Zurich and a poorer but even more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers received a great deal of money to rotate a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says Bankenforscher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high intellectual, modest, which understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the Bauchmensch, who has worked up from the banking teaching to the top."
But Ospel left to the end of Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive error at the end: "He thought that his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, overmut was the case.
UBS employees reminiscent of the leadership meetings on which Group Chief Wuffli repeatedly issued the same parole: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She launched the "League Tables", the ranking lists that documented the success of the banks of that time.
Then the UBS wanted to get upstairs.
Some steps have already been successful.
In the fishing business and in the share trade, she played upstairs.
However, firm consultants who were commissioned show a weakness: in the international interest business, in the "Fixed Income" language, there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has holes with American mortgage products.
To close these limbs, UBS showed her to an adventure that she almost cost the existence.
The Bank itself and a hedge funds founded before it in American sub-prime investments were hungry after growth.
It developed into a huge machine that packed securities on American mortgage credits and continued - but also maintained risks.
Also, when other banks have long been looking for the exit.
"Only in summer 2007, when the American real estate market standed in Flammen, UBS bought there," says Bankenexperte Geiger.
So big the Euphory, so deeply the case.
One manager had to go after another than the attempts to make more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become a luxury seat and are wakely up until today.
Who leads the Grand Bank now has a almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has come from all close business models.
Bank researcher Geiger has already an idea: conclusion with investment banking, concentration to assets management, return to Swiss roots.
The Bank does not want to go (now).
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
On the next Thursday, the new bank head of Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to introduce its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Schweizer was in fact only as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from predecessor grips.
In the meantime, he continued: He is supposed to lead the businesses of the UBS, and the Zurich Bank shared on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank in the middle of the nineties.
He stresses 3500 places.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already making.
He's only saying that he's just going to be looking for a home in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens US stocks
The threatening recession in Europe has taken the U.S. Investors the courage for the week.

Europe will not be able to free from a recession, and there are also further signs of weakness in the banks.
The Warren Buffett confirmed this caution only: it was not yet clear that Europe was strong enough to do everything for an end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.

Intelligent crowns spread in cities
In many places, seed crops are considered to be "people": but out of the cities the highly intelligent animals are no longer expelled, experts claim.
One might be they who want others to get rid of very quickly: herds have been a city picture since centuries, but in many municipalities, residents have been inflicted by drag and noise of the animals.
There is no means against the "bleemvogels" in view of this.
Seed crowns were no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crystal symposium in the East-Friese empty.
There, specialists from the entire federal area were referring to possible routes.
They are searching for alternatives in the cities
Nature guardians also led to the refuge of the particularly protected seed crops in cities: the chemical intake in agriculture is increasing the traditional habitats.
The hunting, growing cultivation and the case of typical brown trees made the birds difficult for life.
Crowns are under natural protection.
Large colonies with more than 600 brute pairs are included in the western Valley Soest, in the northwest of Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen and empty.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crowns in the district of negative coup lines had provided.
Criticians had described the catching of animals in bird falls and the beating with knews as particularly brutal.
"The normal turbulence, the magnitude, brings nothing," found Werner Klöver's city and landscape plane from empty.
Nesters sprinkle with water or fall trees, often have unwanted consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals softened, large colonies split up and distribute in other places."
Grime is merely perceptible to hospitals, age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we no longer get them away."
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities has not been solved, the mayor Wolfgang Kellner said of empty.
Recallablely, a combination of excavators of animals from sensitive living areas and locking offers to retreat them in other places.
"Info tables instead of chainsägen" were the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta Maria Jürgens for a whole different handling with the animals: "We can finally end up with a pepper in the face."
Jürgens had founded the ashberger crown-leaving path in Schleswig-Holstein to inform the indication of the life of the high-intelligent seed crops.
The project is already accepted by tourists.
Also to criticize the noise of the birds, Jürgens had a own opinion: "There is every lot of communication that have much to say."
The intelligence and ability of the animals are legendary: seed crops are not only utilised in order to get to a leaker but even to produce their tool as a tool.
Behaviours of the University of Cambridge have recently tested four seed crops, as far as the intelligence of birds is enough.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they had to bring a taste with stones to an instortion in order to get to a mottenlarve.
Without a lot of training they realized the size and shape must have a stone to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the preserved crowns then had to solve a more kneasy problem.
In a vertically established cylinder, researchers had placed a small embroidery with a mottenlarve.
With the snatch, the birds couldn't reach their pants.
However, researchers had put them on wire pieces.
From this all four animals formed a hake, with which they then charged the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crops have even reached anhieb.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the doors on a coup remained out.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are involved in EM 2012.
Portugal, Czechia, Croatia and Ireland have dissolved the last tickets to the European Championship 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.
Introducted by the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal struck Bosnia-Herzegowina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM partition perfect after 0:0.
The Czechs had a 1:0 (0:0), after playing (2:0) had already been a clear thing in the Play-off game at the outer part of Montenegro.
Nothing more burned in Croatia also left 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland took a locker 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) achieved the further results for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic had shortened twice for Bosnia with a transformed trade meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow-Rote Card (54.).
Bosnia has already failed in the Playoffs to WM in South Africa in 2010.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a measure of start.
Ronaldo was hunting out of about 30 meters for early lead to the machinery.
A good quarterly hour later, Nani showed its high-resistance quality and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians who did not take place in the first half hour had their first clear chance through Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English table leader Manchester City put a headball on the bottom of the late, but the ball did not exceed the Torline (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, Schiedsrichter Wolfgang Stark was focused on Ergolding.
After a attack against hero postiga in the Bosnian penalty room, strongly decided on sulphur and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade firm after a action by Fabio Coentrao, which was safely changed by Misimovic.
But after the break, the Vice-European champion of 2004 made all the clear with four results.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended in the 81th minute also the last doubts.
Thus, the European Chair of 1976 leads to the EM for the fifth time.
However, the team of Trainer Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) had luck and had to survive a terrible certificate in the early phase.
Finalmann Petr Cech prevented with a reflection at the last moment a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the criminal space border just just just passing on the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crosslating had to rescue for the already killed world class driver of the Czech, again the storm of the FC Seoul (50.).
The gate soon before the end finally made everything clear.
The Turkey now missed Zagreb’s football wonder.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the doors in Zagreb did not exceed one 0:0.
While national trainer Guus Hiddink has to reach its place on the bank of the WM third of 2002, the Croatians may welcome their fourth participation in a EM round.
31.000 viewers in the Maksimir City had almost wandered the doors to a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance committee only the pounds, the attacker Kazim Kazim Kazim couldn't send the abpraller in the gate.
After the fears, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from the VfL Wolfsburg, who took place for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62th minute, the Bundesliga-Legionary Danijel Pranjic (Bayern München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Each Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni go to EM
In Dublin, Iren celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of Trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken care of a pre-decision with the 4:0 success, in the 32th minute.
Constantine Vassiljev (57.) looked like guests.
Ireland pressed from the start to the tempo, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment, the Estonian back team prevented the possible leadership.
But in the 32th minute it was far.
After a ignorant defense by Finishmann Pavel Londak, Ward was at the place and pressed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
Empathy and greatly, Peter Englund's new book begins "Schönheid und Schrecken. A history of World War I, tells in nineteen fatsals" with a long list of main individuals going to heart.
Here a tip how to do: Cut this page carefully and make it to your bookmark.
They will get to know these people in Englund's romantic story very well. And these main individuals will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments, in which you are lost like Englund's men and women in the nephew of war and your illusions are robbed.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book, which he does not describe inappropriately as "a work of the anti- story".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is "feel, impression, experience and mood".
"Happy and terrible" almost the experience of wars of 20 more or less unattended men and women together on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanists to mountains, doctors, car drivers and offices.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some will be imprisoned to war, lose memberships, get crazy or death.
Everyone of this life swallows up like the Votiv Churches in a church, some come add, while others are removed.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that World War I was only the devastating political war on the Westfront.
"Highness and terribleness" is surrounded with expert views of other war views: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers fall into this book, a feather Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefly is an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moving book.
The war overwhelms the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, such as a Hurrikan Katrina, who crys to Cordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and canon fire hear in the distance. Do you stay or take the escape?
Who's coming?
Almost someone understands what happens or why this war is all led.
"Featuring facts", says Englund, "were accumulated with mutations, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, Alpine rooms and gentles."
"Security and terribleness" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship matrix.
Their stories were mainly taken out memories, letters and other materials already published.
Their life reports may be terrible or fascinating, but they are extremely alive in Englunds of the small moments lost in detail.
Many of them act by lack and Sich help.
In the history of a German school girl, he relates: "Substitute, everywhere."
"Procurement coffee, false aluminium, wrong radiergum, paper bundles, wood buttons."
He tells more about the replacement in Germany.
He describes "Fleish that was made of pressed rice and baked in hammel fat (and was last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco, made from dried roots and dried potatoes, shoes solely solely with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food additives that were allowed in the production of worsts, 511 registered coffee sales."
Some stories act by honor and floppy.
One American recognizes his own urge for wildness and says about the war: "You feel that, despite everything that was rather intended for men than sitting in the Lehnstuhl, with the evening sheet, the bestseller, and a cigarette and a Whisky in hand, and so to do as to mean such a fascade civilization and as if there was no bariblei behind the own strengthened and beaten Hemdbrust."
In turn, a British soldier recognizes that he probably dies and nobody will notify or care about it.
"If you take a distance from the thought to give yourself, you want to think that this happens before a audience," he writes.
Rather, it is as terrible as a man who was imprisoned in the secret.
Other perceptions are of the old Europe that falls apart and about new types of terrorism.
"The conflict became increasing as a economic competition," says Englund, "a war between the factors."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiory of the still young century": "The word applied and ideologically convinced mass killers in the measure of slaughter while sitting behind a desk."
People act unprecedentedly and there is just as free behavior like Heroism.
Englund refers to the soldiers who actively tried to interfere with a prostitute with a gender disease in order to escape the front service.
"The great expression of this can be discovered in trade with Gonokokken-Eites, because soldiers bought and smashed their genitaly in the hope of coming into the hospital," he writes.
"Your who were really desperate, called him into the eyes, which led them to blind the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englunds Poesie is devoted and yet inevitably adapted to his human task.
In thousands of small scenes, he starts the way the war "in a unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start to ask why their leaders bring them to fight.
The best books about World War I were mostly defected like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romans such as Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" as extensive history books.
Englund's band contributes to an unconventional ruhmeshalle.
His book has the most devastating end of which I've ever read in a bagbook.
I don't give it anymore.
But it is as if he had scraped us with his book this side with the main persons in front of the nose and knocked with a wood.
After an early failure, a minutely planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved in some of them carrying use helmets.
One had decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday because there are few people in Zucotti Park at this time.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All others believed to participate in an exercise.
Police president Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the last weeks like the introduction of Pfeffersspray against protesters, which violates the rules of the denominator, and the housebessetters made an enormous increase in public sympathy no longer allowed to repeat.
And so, after two weeks of planning and training, the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park.
Officials had prepared them by observed how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view to Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
The officials strengthened the chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deposit of a large number of police officers - to concentrate on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to join the park came "in the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the commands which spoke for a declaration as "prising".
"The few police who were involved in my knowledge didn't know that it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only who knew that it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-level officials of the Ressort."
A reason for secreting was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then returned when hundreds of protesters came together after they had experienced these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the Tuesday operation, including mission commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually used in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day many people go in the park, almost like Pendler, so that 1 hour in the night is a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people staying in the park," he said.
Sales cars with jupiter lamps and speakers were ready before departure at the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the previously recorded news that were boasted from the speakers seemed to scare many protests.
When the public officials ended in their light blue wind jacks in the park, many protesters simply accumulated their things and left the place.
The police said that no tents would be taken up to 1:45 p.m. to give the protesters time to pack their hab and well together.
Other teams of officials have been seen how they gathered in the environment to take action should be arrested in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, speaker of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claimed that they wanted to stop watching police operations in the park, and they said that the officers were very rough.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in Church Street could have made photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west by the great intercourse on personal matters of protesters, including bags, art breeds and cloths, followed their employees of the city cleaning which had been abandoned.
Some protesters who refused to go have been slapped outside. Images of this have been published shortly later on the Internet.
A main core of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodic arrests.
Caca 10 people in the Epicentre of the camp joined their arms.
And two people ceased themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Officers of disaster protection were called to cut them off.
Mr Kelly said that no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
The rumor was completed after 75 minutes after statements of the police.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, as he said, because of "inappropriate acquisition and resistance against a arrest".
The most prominent local officer was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the highest uniform official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of criminal officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly did not "do the operation," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of officials waited at the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, Barrikaden were built.
It could be observed how these locations from the police continue to expand the area around the Zuccotti Park.
One place was observed how several officials, many of them with protective paintings, driven people outside.
Approximately 28 persons were in the northern surroundings.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
By 5 p.m., south of the Pine Street a protester protested on the roof of a police vehicle and other demons left the air out of the maturing of a police bus.
In one place the amount threw a piece of block wood.
At the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
The holder's trade union will be advocated to the city because of dismissions.
The universities, who have lost their work last month, are planning to complain the city on Wednesday, as the dismisses are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on schools that are poor students.
The complaint is probably the last possibility of the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to undo the releases.
Six hundredth-seventy school helpers, care coordinators and other employees who were among the poorest paid employees of the city and had lost their work on 7 October, the trade leader as a political racing to refuse the access to a health phond under the working groups with which the budgets should be closed in the past year.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the Council of the City, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, last month, the releases were part of the budget that we had adopted in June.
A member of the Council of the City was shot back and told him that in the budget nothing specificer would be that employees would be released from school aid.
Officials of the Council of 37 said that they had and warned the Ministry of Education before a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the application of the complaint is formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will bring up Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as an accused and bear eight dismissed workers as complaints who are all over colored or latein American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the City Ministry of Justice, said that the city does not charge the complaint and thus could not be commented on their individual claims.
According to a complaint draft that the New York Times is present, the union focused on the number of dismissals in the city's army districts to support a complaint for inequal treatment. They claimed that poor schools would have lost more helpers as they were chronicly underfinanced.
She suggests that while there were no releases on States Island and only a few releases in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school helpers in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in the districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five of eight school helpers who were appointed at the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of devoted parents who can organize donations to capture budget shortages."
P.S.: The 36th District budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. Moreover, money was lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each Armenian school inscription.
The trade union also accused that the heads of high schools were guided by the language in a memo into the irre, which approved the release of care coordinators.
The memo uses the English word "excess", to describe the action even if "excess" (Germanly: transmit) in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from the balance list of a school to a pool of available workers who are paid by the central centre.
"Sechsundsechic care coordinators were released, not transmitted", says the complaint design.
Mission Finished, Congress ready to comply with Libya
Finally it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already consultating with regard to the restraints in Libya.
All that was necessary to do was the success of the revolutions, the arrest and murder of the long-term dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Senat Committee decides a resolution understanding the President John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conticut), lobling libya for the successful rebellion and US troops for their "mouth".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya, who have started the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.
"She is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but until now nothing was simple in the Libya Debate.
This summer, lawsmans of both parties and the White House are engaged in the choice of a series of resolutions on the approving or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya Mission of the NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approved the restricted use of military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected by a wide marginal group of both parties in the Senate, and there was no vote.
However, on the same day, this law took place in the Senate. In addition, the Chamber adopted a decision to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
This means that the US mission took a kind of legislative feather - with a convention that was raised enough to criticize Obama’s approach within the mission, but not angry enough to take away the ground finally.
Then the determination of the convention was overridden by the events.
Tripoli falls under the libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO Commission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "greats the people of Libya to their enormous courage and its extraordinary persistence in their self-freeness" and "lobs the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also confirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition to Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support by the Office for Foreign Relations or will they divide the legislators as it did in June?
The last version stood on the resistance of the Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indian Police), the top-republikan of the Committee.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol it is at the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every conventional period of the Republicans and some democracy.
The measures under the ruling of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or other areas that are currently coming to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have yet tried to vote their amendments, although they often tried to do so.
Good leave change is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to this convention and include a whole bandwidth of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented both to the Congress and to the Senate - others are only slightly soft off each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget alone in the Senate and another dozen that would control "fund expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - in particular beginners with the Republicans who want to politify their course of life - the possibility to speak of having such a measure "written".
The budgetary control law adopted in August requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budget compensation.
In March 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that may be presented by members of the convention, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to retain the limits to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits a marriage under equality is, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, an ongoing template.
Some legislators also want to allow the withdrawal of federal laws if the twodrittels of the States reject them.
As active as members suggest amendments, they are more quickly moving as in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers submitted 77 such amendments in the 110th Congress 66.
In comparison with the early 1990s, Members regularly held more than 150 changes every two years, the rate concludes the figures made available to the Senat library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment that is added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Furthere but not defeat," says Enterords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after a armed man from the next distance on her shot during a election event in Tucson, the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) opened on the national television Monday evening. She sang alone to the Broadway station "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to the convention.
When she came up with Diane Sawyer in the ABC messages "20/20", she ran by words and needed help in walking.
The mission showed the heavy slow restoration of the damage that the ball shared its shelter, crossed the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to the Congress to give her voice to blame brakes.
In their first television interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Enterord smiled, laughed and sang - and described her genesing as "swore".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Enterord (41) answered: "Good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the Astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a unanimous "20/20"-Special that was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The Specials pursued Gifford's curse since the attack of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, she was seen in the hospital bed, with crocheted head and a long scarf over the front.
She can only have one or two fingers if her husband encourages her.
Months later, Gifford's sitting in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nick with the head.
A suit with the lip.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Gifford's flüstering another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Enterords' genesung: One sees how the congress officers sing together with the therapists on Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Casein".
In interview with Sawyer, Giffords who spends two hours daily with therapy said that she cannot remember the day of attack.
Her husband said that he had read Enterords on March 12, when she interrupted him and asked him for the first time after the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The Mutual Schütze Jared Lee Loughner is siting in a prison in Missouri and is usually treated medically while waiting for his negotiation.
"Many people have died," gave Enterords Sawyer.
"Hard, heart, heart."
During the healing of his wife, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I was hit."
"Well, I would say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated"?", said Kelly.
You're just hit.
And you will stand through this, and you will recover you, and you will come back more than ever before.
Trupping feels more compassionate than respect
The event was a Wall Street Gala that gathered millions of dollars for obdachless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a tag, hundred soldiers, matroses, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The amount in black smokings stood up and applaudated.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation operation in the spring.
An ranker military officer on the Gala, which was observed by the Chief of Stab and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were imported like Waisenkinders," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it was not respectful, really not. It was compassionate.
The contradictive impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between military and most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are exhibited with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise has his prize, say servants.
The public becomes increasingly as if she did the people in uniform suffering.
"We were not victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded forces in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who are not unthankful or in the conflict with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger, the returning forces against the war of Vietnam in recent years, was far worse.
As a result, talks about compassion will take place in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons have returned from fighting with the marines, Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would consider them with a feeling of reverence as they were victorious and traveled to exotic places.
Others would ask if a "greater, violent veteran under the surface" disappeared, Cancian said, who had fought in Iraq and took over a retired state post in Washington after his return.
During his work, he said, he felt that some of the questionrs were subtlely wondering whether he could have been able to keep the pressure of a demanding post in Washington just after his return from the fight.
"If you spare about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian said his sons.
The missing lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of the interest of the Americans in the war.
Services in the battlefield are seen only rarely by a country that has little experience with military and only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroes as it was absolutely common in the Second World War," said Leutnant General David Barno a.D., commanding US forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of the politicians and the public focuses on the suffering of a servant.
Truppen find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military pressures are being made to tackle in rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of non-incidence in rape before the military court.
If it is not possible, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Upper-free Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her cassette in Miramar north of San Diego from the dinner with a friend when she met to a male colleague who carried a 12 pack beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her at a drink in her room.
"My alarms went on," said Lyman.
But the Texaner had their concerns on the side.
I thought, "Is something, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard of my abdominal feeling."
A few minutes after leaving Lyman's rooms, the man behind her, pressed her down and raped her, claimed.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other military servants are anxious to a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a complaint that they have been authorised against the former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not been against the widespread rape within the military and under the infringement of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer filed from Washington, D.C., the complaint was at the beginning of 17 complaints, which increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military had failed to determine, judge or to provide an appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership as the problem starts there.
"The military is built herearchically," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the cultural compensation of the to eradicate? The leader."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: instead of saying that all applicants will put their eggs into a basket, they will, if necessary, provide many further complaints to get the pressure upright.
The team of defence for the Ministry of Defence, led by state lawyer Neil MacBride, has requested a request to reject complaint.
The acts of the Court of First Instance, which existed in Newsweek, set out detailedly the defense strategy, in the first place that the military cannot be accused of present or former soldiers for infringements to which it has come into forces.
Due to a law of the Supreme Court from 1950, called Feres Doctor, the government is not liable for infringements which are added to soldiers in the active service.
"The mutanical damages were created during the military service of the applicants," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this history.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in war negotiations.
It's time that military is modernized, says Burke.
And they do not stand in their battle alone: three other complaints besides their steadfast.
At the Yale Law School, veterans' Legal Services Clinic presents a complaint against the four most important military academies because of mutatisfactory promotion of a female enemy atmosphere.
On the other hand, Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military in which we concentrate on the diagnosis "personality distortion", who received rape victims to release them from the service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the veteran administration (dt.: Managing of the War Veterans) in which she warned their discrimination practices in handling power claims for persons who have been sexually abused in the service.
The new laws were presented to the convention independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of points of evidence.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (dt.: Office for Prevention and Reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defence 3,58 sexual abuse.
However, most misuses are not reported at all and, according to the own estimate of the Pentagon, this figure takes account of about 13,5% of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded were in the military court before court, only half as much as civil law.
The applicants in Burkes case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the moderate rape of military police less than one hour after the accident.
This night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of its rape of a number of police, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker who came from a cut to his arm was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked for the sex she had before the attack with her friend.
Six persons said as characteristics in the name of the discreet deceaser who was finally freely spoken.
"I remember the day when the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the wheat would take. I ran screamingly out of the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department, and I remember that when I came back, I said to my commendator, that was not his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to look at a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it inadequate for service.
In January 2010, she was firmly released so that she could not receive any support.
Whether the complaint, which Lyman and the other complaints submitted, progresses, is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of legal science at George Washington University Law School.
Yet, he notes, "After my view they should go ahead."
What is between them and a jurisdiction is this doctor, who is criticized since she was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctor in time.
The military hacks a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and the same terrifying that brings a liability.
He adds: "The opportunities stand against them... but it is important for them that they try it."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the lawyer of the applicant, will begin with its hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue fighting the military in this respect until reforms come," she says.
Or until we die what is always the first thing to happen.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are watching on Facebook
Before being a new face of legal ekremism in Europe, Anders Behrening Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-migration opinion online.
On Monday Breivik, who had been able to commit an amoklauf in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, his first public hearing before court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is not only in the Cyberspace alone: He has spent a lot of time to his attack before his computer and chased with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-extreme groups on pages of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find her?
This is easy - you just need to log in at Facebook.
"We have detected that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report from the British idea factory DEMOS about digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's Hidden personal data is so enzycloped, says Bartlett that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the site to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found a half million fans of right-extreme groups throughout Europe and then shared them with adds, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users invited a survey that asked for their educational status, their attitude towards violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 100,000 members of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving their office.
"It's a very new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are barely surprised. Online leaders of right-extreme groups are usually young, male and angry about immigration .
But in a sort of surprising twist, "the ones who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is only an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideasers, medical researchers and politics use the site to study everything, from health issues to society trends such as in "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, which add three content per day, Facebook's "Datsupernova" generates a research tree that caused the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title of the last five years to increase by nearly 800%.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is the fact that you can study people on the street through this site that you normally don't reach with its clipboard.
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and that had never given them access," says Bartlett.
"In Facebook, all this is going away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to detect and solve social health problems.
A current study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full-run on Facebook are more significantly looking towards the drink of problems than students who swear over this subject.
Moreno suggests that equal students, for example, monitor the website and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you didn't know it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and Head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We have found a possibility to identify dangerous children that were not found elsewhere."
Facebook also constantly adds the data of his own population.
The data team of the page has created statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's day, election participation in the intermediate elections 2010 and a national luck index (who were primarily used information that only Facebook access has - master of digital freedom has long been aware that the page should make its large data found rubs accessible for other research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the site they observe whether they want or not. To play Scrabble with a friend that is thousands of miles away, you can allow the page to issue your personal data.
But what if users will be part of a survey that they do not even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined directives as they collect their data offline, all is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, at a study from 2006 where he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participants is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years, Selwyn thinks as a technology researcher that a clipboard and a pen is still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no replacement for going out to the real world and to talk to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of socially - and every amount of social life still takes place offline."
"Colt and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who standed two amok courses in which 77 people were killed in this summer in Norway, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistant" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple driver of Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I raise objection to the court, since you have received your mandate from organizations, supporting hatsideologys and thus being supported by multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I don't know me guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monology, since he did not want to give "breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who presented a prescribed speech, the permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the Breivik police will remain in investigation for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will monitor all visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he was staying behind castle and Riegel.
All participated in the objective that everything runs on a trail.
"I thought he works cold and inhuman," said one survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian sender NEK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it continues after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark attraction and a blue scratch and worked quietly and professionally during the whole hearing. He looked to journalists and survivors when he betrayed and left the building again.
Despite Breivik's bizarrem note that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he wasn't mental ill and said that there was no evidence that he had complicated.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But it automatically facilitates the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he does not,' said the family of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons of interview with the dead Steve Job, which was shown in a theatre this week
After Steve Jobs died on 5 October, some compared him with Henry Ford, and there was a great modern inventor of technology.
What Apple-Fans may find the most explicitly discovered job interview, which has been discovered in this week before special film presentations on the important markets, is how much this creative headwork has understood business processes and working processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acrybian organizer who was actively bastled in diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffered "a illness of thinking," "that a really great idea is 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of handicraft between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph der Fachidents" about the breakdown of the personal computer. And he sat longer than an hour with jobs in which they led one of the rare, detailed discussions.
At that time, as 10 years ago, Jobs had been moved from Apple, and he already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and rejoiced to the wide-ranging of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in professionals, he says that the copyrights of the interview were missing in delivery.
Only after Job's death, a complete VHS copy was discovered in the garage of the director.
This easily revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The lost interview", which comes to the Landmark Theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
Jobs is surprisingly surprisingly appearing for someone who is known for his detailed interviews in this area in explaining its technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredible thought.
During the interview, it comes four times to longer break between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds after consideration, where Job's clearly considers his thoughts and strives to accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs' Perfectionism will come to the day when he seems to respond unduldigously to Cringelys questions and encourages him to take more quickly into subjects or interactions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview appears somewhat indispensable when Jobs rate what other companies make his opinion right or wrong and represent his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read post-human words of the career Jobs. But here Jobs as the greeting dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and how things should be.
Soon after he had done all this, he left and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to lead a company:
"Why are you doing things?", "Why are you doing things all over the years in business?", and the answer you always get is, "Oh, it's easy to do."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in the business really thinks about things.
I found that.
Jobs continues his efforts to rationalise the booking at Apple.
Remained how costs were recorded - mostly they started with "standard costs" which were merely motivated and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed a automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined until the least.
As the Pope was specialized:
Jobs relates to the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could lead to the telephone society and otherwise lead to remote talks.
About the device has been written a lot, but Job's enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a charged phone, operate an call and then connect from an AT&T network to another, while they run as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things a half dozen time around the globe and when you grilled into the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next to the phone," Jobs shaking.
"We were young and we learned that we could build up a little something that can control billions of dollars on infrastructure all over the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be no apple without them.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike, the Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they cried through the Vatican through Blue Box in the middle of the night, and they wanted to talk to the Pope while they were able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomats, the two had to be laughed before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he loved himself in the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett claims):
At the age of 12, when he looked for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phoneat, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen in age and it formed my views about what a company was and how well it treated his employees."
Later Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labors in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computers ever made".
He was as big as a bag, had a little screen with Braunscher Röhrene and I loved me in him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview Jobs talks about how to find spontaneously new products.
Early in his career, when he built some plates, he was asked by a customer to build up the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the cooperation and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later at Apple, he remembers the problems he had during the development of a computer wall:
"I remember arguing arguments... you shouted me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was unbelievable.
About large companies leaving:
Long before he released Apple, Jobs saw the paths on which so many industrial ignorators, with their visions, have been in steady and forgotten control over their shares.
"We're saying you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're making a better copyer or printer, to and?"
They have share monoopol, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, i.e. [since such people] that eventually lead the companies and the product with which people are motivated from the decision.
The product genius that has led to this monopolation is necessary by people who have no concept regarding good products for bad products, eliminated handicraft.
That happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have had the whole computer industry.
You could have been ten times larger, Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You've fought the defeat of the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"It lies a lot of art of handicraft between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his fans.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electronics, glass, robots, factorys.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and they all bring together...
Finally, it's on the taste, it's going beyond trying to get out with the best witness that people have created, and then try to gather these things together to what you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists are copying, great artists cling.
We're always shamless in the steel of great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh made great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zomerologists, historians who are randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it was not the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinate with opponents of health laws as court accept case
On the day of which the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically shared question, whether one will be addressed by President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner that was sponsored by the office that the case was represented before court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met a meeting in order to consult the petitions for examining.
One of the cases to be treated was a complaint that 26 States have raised against the far-reaching reform of the health sector, which had been decided last year by the Congress, a law which was the root of the conservative activists throughout the U.S..
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, in March, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion will be expected, which is likely to curb its result to be in full progress to the presidency campaign in 2012, which will be at the time when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who is on court and claims that the law is to be dressed will probably be Paul Clement, one of the General State lawyers under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's Kanzlei, Bancroft PLC, was one of the almost two dozen companies who supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-sense group dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company that represents the dinner sponsorte, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which fighted the law.
Another sponsor was the Pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc. who is extremely involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took a few hours after the court had consulted the case in a Washington Hotel.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the President of the Republicans in the Senat and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been visiting events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that doesn't understand moral rules.
In fact, Judges are free from the Code of Conduct that governs the acts of the Lower Bundesgerichte.
If they were to be subject to principle 4c of the code, which states: "A judge can participate in the laws of beneficiary events nearer and other organizations, while the judge cannot be a spokesman, honor gas or no guest of such events according to the programme."
In fact, the extreme vicinity of Scalia and Thomas was two of the cigarettes related to the case as well as to a company with an enormous financial interest in this in order to alarm moral and governmental activists.
"This abounding break with morality and the contrast to the code is punishing the complaints of some judges lying, the court holds the same rules applying for all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil law movement in the USA.
"The judges won and dinned during a beneficiary event with lawyers with sweating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and their support of a donation action for this event undermine any claim on inevitability and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas do not show little consideration to critics who say that they would mix court affairs too easily with groups leading from the agenda, such as the Federalist society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives claim that the judge Elena Kagan, who has a moral problem, is not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a lawyer of the State under the Obama government when the first law attacks came before court.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw themselves from the hearing of the case because of predetermination, as it was too much engaged in the defense of the law to be unprecedented.
Kagan doesn't make any events to do this.
Boeing draws record record of 18 billion dollars to country
Airline Emirates order 50 two-way aircraft of type Boeing 777 with one option on 20 other aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business in value of more than 1 billion dollar.
It is really a rare message that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business if the company is the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the listing price for these 50 aircraft is totally at a record sum of 18 billion dollars.
The client of Boeing is also unusual: the Middle East, an increasing gold mine of future airplane orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, Chicago's company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need 2.520 aircraft to be worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced his biggest task for commercial aircraft on the weekend, measured at the value of order: 50 two-usual Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer contract came from Dubai Airline Emirates.
The airline has also announced Boeing at Dubai Aviation View in 2011, an option on the purchase of 20 further aircraft that allows the whole listing price to rise to $26 billion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8 ordered, the so-called Dreamliner, who greatly improved the gas consumption and comfort of passengers.
The listening price for six of these aircraft lies at more than 1 billion dollar.
"That's absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Börsenfachmann of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are owned by the oil production countries.
So they don't only have the money to pay the aircraft, but more often, an increase in oil prices, which usually harm the airlines, because this is one of their largest cost points, is not so harmful because the country deserves at a higher oil price.
This is important because it tends less than other airlines to cancel or move aircraft orders when the oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"You have a natural insurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitor SAS in Chess, which attacks the pre-office with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the airline view comes four months after Airbus announced that you would move the introduction of the largest A350 that was compete directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction is scattered to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher cost of business and a wide range.
The Boeing activity increased by 1.5% to $ 67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President seems to be voting in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer opponent Fausto Vallejo supported the PRI in race around the governor posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost its application for the office of Muchoacan's governor during the violent national elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race for one of their opponents.
According to the provisional results, Fausto Vallejo won the race around the governor posts in the Western state by the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The attack of organised crime during the entire election process and especially on the stirring day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates to our employees in the survey ... you have occupied election cabins, build up road blocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost the Presidency in 2000.
But they strive to return and win in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidency election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just snatched Claderon that had been in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to acknowledge Vallejo as winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutions Party PRD, who is currently an active governor, came to the place three, a heavy deposit for the split and luckless left leadership for the presidency election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the provisional results.
Vallejo, former Mayor of the capital of Morelia, liables connections to drug dealers and encourages the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been governed by drug cards specialized in Marihuana, Heroin, and Amphetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a militaryly led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence still lasts.
A PAN citizen was killed a week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have gone out of fear of the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how decisive the elections in Michoacan also appear.
The man who is probably represented the PRI in the race around the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, the Vallejo from Washington, and said: "I think that this victory will give us a courage to watch the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help the euro area's salvation
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the euro area's rescue in its heavy debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will breach the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB seat in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economics in the world must "all in your power" do to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either by the International Monetaryfound or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned the problems in Europe before the BRIC countries (Brasilien, Russia, India, China) and said that financial support of European leadership and European resources help prevent a long-term breakdown of the global economy.
"We all sit in the same boat."
"Also, everyone can help Europe from this crisis," he said the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asien may be protected until a certain degree, but it's not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all means."
Europe’s currency union has been in a serious debt crisis over the last few months.
In recent days, the cost of interest increased hazardously and the Prime Ministers have fallen down both from Italy and Greece.
The challenging guilt crisis in Europe is anxious that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calling that leading threshold countries should be together to support the euro area.
Mr Nag said that any support for Asia is channelized by the IWF but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of the EU Council Fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiation power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister for Trade, said that "if everything is going to do in his power," to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering under the falling exports and foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the euro area to remain instabil and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to get a high level of growth."
"It's no option, it's a task, for where we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Other arguments that developing economies such as India do not have the opportunity to help the rich Europeans if they face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the US Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1,2 billion people in India help for Europe, of which more than $800 million or less live on the day.
"On the occasion they will find out that the Greeks are going to rent with 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to maintain the numerous and well paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly led, losses incurring institutions such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the crisiss in the euro area will have "significant Domino Effects" throughout Asia.
The ADB forecast with an economic growth by 7.5% in Asia for 2011/ is now "the risk of auction" due to the threatening risk from Europe.
He said that harmful threshold markets should create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital reduction of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon before possible cuts in the defense system
Defense Minister Leon Panetta rejoiced the convention on Monday when he warned that automatic budget shortcomings would weaken national security, so that he dismissed a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls until the war views in Afghanistan and the civilian rivers.
The Pentagon is already thinking reductions of $450 billion over the next decade, but now fears that further reductions will be made by $600 or more if the Congress cannot finish in expenditure.
"The effects of these reductions would be devastating for the Ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the convention in the objective of a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called pollutation, would lead to 23% general reductions and a stop to numerous new projects.
"Since a high reduction, performed in such an unspeakable way, most of our ships and construction projects would be indispensable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernisation efforts seriously," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves freely from a large part of our civilians and, as the reduction would be so rapidly implemented, we would have to authorise civilians with certain border probability to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously harm our alerts."
The reductions have finally been hit by the fighting forces," said Panetta.
"When the war period quotas were not directly affected by the polluting, the serious intervention into the basic budget would be adversely affected by the war's efforts," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings were shortened what would lead to delays in the settings and the attitudes supported by the war."
"The holders of the staff would shorten what leads to late payments to wartime dealers and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators replied 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of automatic reductions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a defense reduction in the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid deterioration of the United States as a leading military power in the world."
"We are vehement against this draconic act," said the senators in a joint declaration on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we can't live, and it is certainly no one that one should oppose us."
"The decision is a threat to the national security interests of the United Places, and it should not be allowed."
Whether Panettas's letter and the new warnings of the Senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or will increase claims to eliminate the pentagon of reductions.
Panetta has increasingly expressed the possible reductions, although he could gather experiences with the budget in the convention and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon and knows that he is faced with serious decisions.
At a press conference in the last week, the minister of Defense painted a dark image that could stand for – a military with a scale, but without core.
"It's a ship without matroses."
"It's a brecade without munition."
"It's an air weapon-waver without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a papery man, a army of the caserns, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers, who can fulfil the mission," said Panetta in his opening language in the Pentagon.
"It is a power of dispute that lacks moral and alarm and which is not able to take it with potential opponents."
"They can become a really angry."
In an Annex to his letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta launched new details of how reductions "significant operational risks create: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations of our global application and emission ability, which leads to an inadequate risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects could fall as a victim, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list includes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic U-boats, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new soil fighter, the Army and Marine need to replace the Humve.
If you would stop further development and testing of the F35, this would be saving up to 80 billion dollars in the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to stimulate, so that possible hazards can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Uncover a Lüge
A glance of the current headlines shows how vulnerable and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The President-in-Office of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is in order to become the accusations of sexual harassment of several women. Both sides are considering each other of the lies.
Penn State's leadership is accused of Myid, since it is supposed to have back reports after which a retireed football-trainer boy has sexually abused sexually.
Last week, over an open microphone was heard when the French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to the American president Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a Lügner.
Lügen destroy careers and shaken countries.
The New York Congress Assembly and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made his neglects when he brought illuminations in turn, which were very quickly contradicted by unconsuming evidence.
The former Presidentship candidate John Edwards is accused of the infringement of the campaign financing which is related to the interpretation of an extraordinary affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it dissolved the mediacirkus, President Bill Clinton when lying in the Oval Office during his second term of office on his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about shoes in school and college testing are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers presented their students the testing answers so that they were well at their performance tests.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and shoes are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times each day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered to be an emergency.
Another study shows that strangers lie together three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
The lies to recognise or "discovering lies" is one which is important to learn for every person, and this for both personal and professional reasons.
As far as a society game is removed, such as shame, in which it is the goal of calling "Hab you!", the detarizing of a deception is a serious knowledge area based on scientific data that have been collected at respected universities over the past six decades, which conducted far-reaching research projects, especially in areas of psychology and physiology.
The result of the research is that most old myths have been deterrented about the lie.
lying looks into one's eyes.
They stotter, stumble, roasted, not always crops.
However, it is not possible to conclude that these lievers are difficult to cover and disappoint.
An exercised lie star can go through to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claims, which fine face expressions, about questioning and Timing.
I have spent several years to examine the scientific results of the comprehensive and growing area of disappointment, and it is clear that disappointing is a modern ability of deception that is easy to learn and help us in our complex world, especially if the establishment or question of people or negotiations or administration belong to their own professional responsibility.
Good livers are very good to appreciate others, to wake their interest and to control their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are observed by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more often lying than introverted people that men often want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often lying to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person was disappointed as a wrongdoer, others feel less guilty of lying to this person.
How do you recognize if someone is lying?
First, by watching the normal behaviour of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point to the later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laugh, the quality of their experimental staff.
You should know better when someone usually drops on foot so they do not accuse him to wrong when he tries with the foot during a meeting.
Then take care of appendixes of random verbal and non-balancing practices.
Consider these appendixes as a alarm galls that screw, not as evidence of distarcting.
People who deceive, may be disappointed when they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet towards the door or they reject towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "revolution after the conversation", this deep, relaxing exaggeration and change in the attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questioning often signals falsely that an attitude talk is over, just to keep out after this relaxation after the conversation.
Please also take care of the language of your experimental person.
Scott Peterson's outrut is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and a national search for her.
Täuschening people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeated a profound question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a profound question: "Now... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... after best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceived than suitable, making the alarm galls often screaming.
There is no magician for detarizing lies, but you can learn capabilities, thanks to which a distarcing is possible.
Thanks to these capabilities, everyone can become victims of fraud, both in private and occupational life.
Consumer plan of an oil pipeline is revised after hazard by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government has threatened to deteriorate the approval of a planned oil pipeline of Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, where the trade unions are intimidated and at the same time awaited environmental protection, the pipeline-building company is trying to replan the project to return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company continues to be confident that the pipeline is finally approved, although with another course.
This was the result of an announcement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the last week, after a decision on a Federal Accession for the project, until the new possible course was examined, which would meet the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large subwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has organized may be a decision until 2013, after the elections in the next year, even if officials doubt that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama explained last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said his support.
The 1700 Miles pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barel oil per day from the province of Alberta to the Raffineria in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline should cross six states.
They hate environmental protection, but they love labour markets because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 200,000 jobs.
But the legislator Nebraska, who is against the plan, weighs the laws to force a return from the region of the sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and watering.
The current study on the impact of the Environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had little influence on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the main auditor of the Ministry demanded a separate son of the review procedure which concentrates on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist who was set by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was advisor of Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in an interest conflict.
The other is whether a company who was commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused, since she supposedly forced a kid of fear to break up
A New York family claims that the Disco Diva Patti LaBelle had received a tobsucht attack in the lobby of her Manhattan building that would have put her little daughter so afraid that she had given herself in fear of fear.
The Tiranad of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month old geneve Monk so feared that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "intimate fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was last November, when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, wanted to break up a family trip on 10th and genevet.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went with the bag and genevet on the arm to the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter down for a moment.
"Jemand appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back to the arm," she said.
LaBelle encouraged the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in a aggressive sound, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and started to shimp - she used the F-Wort and the A-Wort and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in the hand and began to kick water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevive would become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Show what you did with my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother who still wore geneve on the arm and had to be retained by her associate and moved to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby shouted so much that it had to pass, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an excuse in writing, but no answer was received.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint is on a non-decisive amount of damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he would not take account of Honorar and plan the family, the money it gets will spend the child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take the responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely inacceptable, especially when it is placed on a child gardener toward the day wearing a 18-month old baby on the arm."
Climate contradictions breached the economy
In the first year, Mario López Valdez at the government, in Sinaloa, increased unemployment and black work, while foreign investment decreased and the economy stagnated.
2011 will remember Sinaloas in the economic history. It is the first year when Mario López Valdez, who himself referred to as the initiator of the change, and has scared great hopes regarding economic growth, the government is. However, due to climate versus growth, the main economic indicators can be deteriorated by growth.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in millions of farms but also the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6% in the first quarter of the year. This is mainly the historical reduction in agricultural development by 31,16%, which was breaching to further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (i.e. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of Frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural property were damaged, with 78.03% of the total and the remaining 21.07% were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity by November has risen continuously in the Mexican state. The Instituteo Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, because 55 053 people in Sinaloas had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53% of the population. In the second quarter, unemployment rate increased to 5.28% and from July to September 6,19%, which resulted in 74 000 unemployment in Sinaloa. This is more than in the first quarter.
Low liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that public institutions' policies are directly explaining the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently watching is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including liquidity losses on the market due to the legislation adopted to combat money laundry in the convention, because for those who are prohibited to raise dollars, it is not easy to allow them to work for themselves to be invested or to use for anything else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment also encompasses a demografic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country to search for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is on the one hand due to the incidence problems and, on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people remain here and look for work to increase unemployment," he says.
Blackwork
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if you take into account the high share of black work, which includes 60.38% of the employees in the country who work without paying the cash of social insurance.
The low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituteo Mexicano del Seguro Social (mexican Social Insurance Organization) and the Secretaryía del Trabajo y Previsión Social (governmental Office for Work and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 peans until September, which is much less than the total state average of 7375 pesoes.
Reduction of the ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, in 2011 the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded. According to Secretaryía de Economía (State Economic Authority) the ADI was $530 from January to June 630,74 per cent, compared to $5 143 312 in the same period.
On the other hand, Secretaryía de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (governmental authority for Economic Development) is a total investment of 17 280 000 peso's in 2011, which comes from companies from the tertiary sector in front of all things.
The Debts
In view of the economic crisis, the national government in July requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 peans to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 communities, but the national convention approved a amount of 200 600 000 peans, but could not be found positive effects on any of the agricultural sectors by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, the first government year Mario López Valdé's government inability made it clear.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico) said that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of different sectors, including national governments.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really inevitable this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the lost Terrain this year and we have to try twice. The efforts of all and especially the progress of the already well agreed government team have not been sufficiently compatible," he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events, as the Frost at the beginning of the year, scared and slowened the country's economic development.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the Frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficient to create a economic dynamics that could produce a acceptable river of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefinite the call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Entrepreneurship Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, stated that it was necessary to allow the State to dynamicer productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that it was worked. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to re-establish economic profession and line of the country, as it is important to enable all the material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There is much to do
The President of Coparmex stressed how important it was to develop a future perspective that leads the government's efforts to better railways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current government power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas in which you can say that the government has handled more comprehensively. What I can say is that it was worked and that the government is aware that there is a lot of work before it," he expressed.
Intake for 8 kg of Marihuana
To five years of imprisonment and 100 deposits were condemned by Navolato because of the possession of eight Kilo Marihuana.
The prosecution of the Republic announced that the drug small dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of Marihuana for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican militarys in monitoring the street Cipriano Valdez compared to the guardpost No 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug small dealer went into a white delivery car where he found a black tissue in a box in the car and on the rider’s seat a small backpack in which militarys found eight kilograms and 23 grams of Marihuana.
For this reason, the contested product was transferred to the Judge of the District and the punishment is still in the execution event.
Debts for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided in the programs Volumebitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 are in danger to not be completed because of missing funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda meant.
The head of the urban Social Development Authority stated that, although the construction programmes have already been advanced, they are now in danger, since the government has not paid the funds available to them which exceeded the three programmes, 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounts to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell on the state.
"Twelve millions of them must be taxed, and although the year is already end, they have not given us any penguin, and that although they had to pay us part in July," he said. "To be not too late, we have already begun with the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the State had not complied with its obligations, why, at the beginning of its government time, the community had to take up a loan of 7 million.
"This has been so in the last legislature period, because the State did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes went on and this year we had to create the funds that the State had not brought up to participate in these programmes," he said.
Even if the State authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister for Management and Finance was requested to speed the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Fast 12 million they have to be taxed, and although the year ends, they have not given us any penguin."
The court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transformation of analogues to digital signals is one of the most important changes in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) pointed out the constitutional complaints submitted by the Senate and the Parliament's House against the Presidial Assembly and forced the switching of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 due to the lack of eight votes required for the counterfeiting of law.
One minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that the President of Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the Decree of Law with the details of switching to terrestrial digital TV.
This Decision rejected the constitutional dispute referred to by Senate, as it did not receive the qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality, so the law remains in force.
In the project for the complaint worked by the Minister Olgaž Cordero, the Decree of Constitution was proposed to explain, as the Comisión Federal de Telecommuniciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the radio and television regulations, why the Decree of Law would contradict the hierarchical principles and the laws preservation.
Trainers of the project agreed only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and>>deu<<e Cordero themselves.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Constitutional Board have not applied to the Law Decree. After the complaints were adopted, the Minister Cordero no longer applied the Decree of Law and introduced all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Auditors without entering the debate on the project responsible for Minister Cordero.
In his contribution, the President of the Minister was not able to agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the national government is not allowed to regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general provisions.
"I do not think that if you would do this, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected", she also recalled that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, the central state government is responsible for constitutional reasons, as it directs national affairs.
The replacement of analog signals through digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place throughout the world in recent years, and it improves the use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The shift of the transformation, she said, is a shift of the exploitation of digitalization, which is a decision in the public interest that does not only have technical aspects, "they have surrounded economic, social, political, and security technical aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "was required to act the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of characteristics that put the constitution into the hands of the central government."
She called in mind that many countries have already done the digital transformation worldwide via the government, although they had high specialized facilities.
One cannot conclude that the government would comply with the edition of the contested Decree in the competences of the convention, as the laws adopted by the Legislative would be held," she assured.
The possibility of selecting the votes in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP’s information, the difference between the first and the second place in the election of the governor is less than 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
This year, the possibility of the individual counting of the vocabulary is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor elections is less than 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074 have not been counted.
In this sense, the President of Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that the election office had adopted a series of rules on harmonisation of local regulations with the reforms of the state in election matters just before 9 November.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they did not enter into force at this election round. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the state indicator within the time limits provided for for for that reason, nor objection.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint submitted by the local law and assessed the vote of the Ombudsman to the constitutional reforms as "indifferent and unlawful", as it does not have the right to "decision or to introduce a veto".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal stated in an interview on the possibility of a single statement of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by Consejo General del IEM, the local election authority now has the opportunity to count the voting list partly or completely.
For example, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more voting packages are partially unanimous; the protocol on vote counting and calculation shall not be met or it is not owned by the chairman of the Voting Committee or there are evident errors or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, the total counterparty of the full-filled voting certificates may be done if there is a difference between the mutable winner and the second place, which is equal or less than one percent, provided at the beginning of the meeting, an explicit application of the party chairman of coalition is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The counterparty may also be in its total if, after the final calculation, it is established that the difference between the mutmaßive winner and the candidate is equal to or less at the second place, provided that it is an explicit application of a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the election packages that have been disposed of a partial counterparty would be excluded.
It is noteworthy that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is less than 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 have not been counted from a total of 923 voting protocols.
His last will

Felipe Bacio Cortés left the place Saltillo very young to enter the school of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't handle it because they meant that it would even speed him on a truck, yet he always strived to achieve his dream to become pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio reminded him as a good person. "He was hardly coming to Saltillo, and he already wanted the whole family to welcome him as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that he was even driven to Zapopán in the age of seven, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what best like him: a plane fly.
A last shift.

On Wednesday Education of the new Italian Government
The Minister of Prime Ministers, Mario Monti, is meeting tomorrow with the President of Italy in order to present this the new government which should offer the crisis that Italy has led on the edge of economic collapse.
The Minister of Prime Ministers, Mario Monti, is meeting tomorrow with the President of Italy in order to present this the new government which should offer the crisis that Italy has led on the edge of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidency palace announced that Monti would meet on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, on Sunday, to confirm government education.
It is assumed that he will introduce a multituded cabinet composed from Technocrates, although not yet is clear when the new President will enter his office.
Monti said that he would present the President of the State the results of discussions with the political parties on government education.
"I want to strengthen my absolute trust in the ability of our country to finish these difficult times," said the former Commissioner of the European Union to the journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm government education, but its comments show that the obstacles are overwhelmed.
The "frame is now well hidden," he added.
In less than three days, Monti has managed to form a government, which is much less time than normal, and in the meantime, Italy fights against a political and financial crisis that has led the costs for debts to an inadequate amount.
The new EU Commissioner Monti's new government has to adopt a hard saving package requested by the European politicians in order to recover the encountered trust in Italy.
The pressure to Eile, which is burdened on Monti, was strengthened by the weak market situation in which Italian government bonds were charged for 10 years by 7 percent of interest. This is the state where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industrial Association Confindustria, shared the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government after all forces."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The Montis successes were significantly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to come back on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to bring good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the middle-right party.
The support of the PL, the largest party of Italy, is essential because many of its members have expressed themselves against a multituded government that is currently forming Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probablely unsatisfied saving measures.
Resistation against his efforts or the destruction of the reforms might bring about a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks, with its indication that a disappointment of Montis is a disaster, also pressure.
Monti started on Monday with its debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurs associations and with youth and women's organizations.
Tuesday evening the round is to be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has launched an extremely rapid change in government as a response to the crisis.
After a short stimulating at the end of the last week, as it was known that Berlusconi would come back, the uncertainty of the success of the new President-in-Office has reached the costs for Italian government bonds again.
Sales of Italy with a State debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU policy screen.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections that are expected to be held in 2013, despite the prediction that the politicians will only give it time to implement the reforms instead of prefer the elections.
Monti expressed that he would like to take politicians into his cabinet, but the large parties are that this should only consist of technicians, a note of their concerns regarding the procedure set up by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual misunderstanding and the ineensities between the parties make the involvement of people from political life complex.
Spaniards have more games than Ticos
From the 22 players obtained from Spain have ten more than 50 international games on the Buckel.
Pages Costa Ricas only has one of 22 occupied 50 games behind.
A giant distinction for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to the friendship game held today at the National Stadion of San José.
While the World and Europe Championship, the number one on the month listing of the FIFA, can look back to a remarkable number of selection games of class A, the three-coloured team only has the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with more than 50 international games.
He reached this number on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup meetings) as well as high-level Europe cups as the Champions League.
In addition, the Spanish Furie experiences in complicated excretion games in the Eurocup and the football worldmeisterschaften.
On the other hand, the Tico Footballs have a few international events under the Concaf, which is located on the FIFA Riang List.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached an equal stand with the former Andoni Zubizarreta on Saturday against England (nowlage 0-1 in London).
Casillas will play against the three-coloured team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi received even a last week recognition from UEFA, along with others of the Irish team, who had reached the magical number of 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the Middle Tower of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of dogs also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and near Michael Umana the left side doormer Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five came up over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least games.
Less than 30 games show up in the Spanish team of Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From sides of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even closer to the 20s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar had not yet one debut and Edder Nelson.
The historical gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett visited Costa Rica in his tour of his 20-year-old celebration
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that is realised"
In the Exclusive talk with Viva, Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of its best concerts on the next Sunday in the national stadium.
For more than 20 years, they were expected, but the band assured that if they were playing in Costa Rica, they had a dream.
This assured the Bassist and co-foundant of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva last week of Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the southern American part of its tour to celebrate its 20-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they come in the National Stadion from 19.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read an excerpt from the conversation whose full copy is found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your costarican fans a dream when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that can be achieved for us too.
This is just the second time we play in South and Central America, and it has been great until now.
I was only once for a holiday in Costa Rica. It is so beautiful country that we will certainly stay there for a few days.
For us it's exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you that because the fans of the band are totally devoted and they experience the days before the concert.
What do you say your most excited fans?
Thank you for standing at our side all these years.
We need almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you, waiting for so long and we're sorry to have used so long until we have come here.
Some people even think that your concert will become the largest show of the year.
Does this not take a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the most magnificent shows that we have placed in the last 21 years took place in the last two weeks.
We have played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we have made fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the jungle. Costa Rica belongs to the best countries in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and his waves to surf?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unpredictable.
My friends have always been driven to surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent area to surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view to the tournee you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the Costa Rica event?
Since we have never played there, we do not have any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile stock.
You never repeat your stock.
Why?
I think this is partly so because we have nine plates and can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so that the decision we will play will not be easy.
If we take two or three songs that we have not played anymore into stock, we can get our concentration better upright and they surprise us because they call us the reasons in memory why these songs pleased us. Otherwise they could be in forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the audience.
With this tournee, you celebrate your 20-year-old history.
If you look back, it is hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I believe that no one of us has proposed to play once in a great rock band for more than 20 years. That's like a dream.
We also continue to put on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together now.
We might and are excited to produce music.
We have lucky to be able to go to the places of the world, which we always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the day of birth of the Greek?
It was always an honor to be part of this group of large bands.
We're well friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and richly unusual when a movement comes from a group of friends.
On the other hand, a band comes out of a city, but it's already unusual if five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we're still playing together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound garments on their tour. We are pleased to be with them all friends and to be part of this oncoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like you stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) has come to us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I believe that we appreciate all of us happy to be alive, and we also care for each other.
We are all close friend, why musical ways have opened to each individual the freedom to experiment.
One who knows the other and his music, it couldn't be better for us.
Your relationship with roem was not always simple. On the other hand, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we've grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we are not too often on tour, because it is too easy to lose this game with huge human masses that love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of music, you remember that you have to care for the music and what they've been in life without failing to be a famous rock star.
What reminders do you have about your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we have written very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a plate until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed about having used so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friendd. When I hear a song or photos, I remember what was for an incredible man Andy and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a joy to go to work, laughing together and speaking about music and soccer and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and the band have chosen for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band enjoyed us the best, so we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live, which will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I believe he sings the first thing that likes him.
Who were you influenced as a bassist?
From so many+
Among the first who attack me, Spiritzer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so much that I could talk about the bassists who like me all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grey alive, although it is no longer a fashion vision?
I think we all don't feel very connected to the word grey.
When I think about it, the bands I have mentioned before, for example Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all others who come up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find this great because it is worth hearing this music and making bands like Mudhoney better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could work slightly easy, but there are other songs such as The End or Just Breathe, which are considered as very dark songs, although they also have some positive.
Both came to me tears when I heard her playing like Ed.
I think if you get older and happen to something traumatics in your life - for example, if you lose a family or a friend - that affects your artistic sheep and your music and these two songs clearly embodie it for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and yet make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori again came to the hospital for medical studies
The former president Alberto Fujimori was delivered to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine the muscle loss of his legs, his home doctor informed.
The 72 years old Fujimori, the 25 years of imprisonment against human rights during his government period (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is four times operated and under control.
Ediabas Aguinaga, Congress member and his personal doctor, said television that Fujimori would examine three days in the peruan hospital Instituteo Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplaásicas for the reason for his pain and muscle losses in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that his opinion could be accompanied by Fujimori for humanitarian reasons, yet he did not want this because he was innocent.
He has been operated four times on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilograms of weight. In addition, further diseases such as a severe erosive gastritis, a cyste in the stomach pestilence, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs, the doctor rose up.
Fujimori is located since September 2007 in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía Haftanstalt.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for the murder of 25 persons by the death scarce of the Perun army, who was secretly active during his government time.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
A official issuing led by the Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs starts their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to extend trade between both countries and to discuss political topics of the region
The next Wednesday Mujica meets Felipe Calderón's Mexican office colleague, which will be a meeting with the Collektiv of the Uruguayians living in Mexico, following the Uruguayan president of the highlight of his booked deadline with politicians, businesses and a meeting.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for exchange of information about all policy areas between the two countries", announced the Presidential office of the South American country on his website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks support for Calderón in the interim with France, when the French Head of State, Nicolas Sarkozy, at the G20 Summit meeting in the French city of Cannes, put the southern American country on a list of tax paradies.
In his discourage, Sarkozy threatened to exclusion of those countries who are still present as a tax paradies, from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and led to a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chaired by the G20 group since November, a group consisting of the world's most powerful thresholds and industrial countries. Since January this year, an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double declarations with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has tried to accelerate the concretion of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be deleted from the "great list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), countries who have not introduced all international standards on cooperation in tax matters.
Since 2004, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The snorrowy installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been unreasonable for the rescue of the princess Peach for 25 years from the clauses of the wicked bowser, but until now he has never fought into three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in Stereo technology.
The game that this month comes to the shops of all the world was cut from the beginning to the properties of the tragable console Nintend 3DS, which can be played without a special Brille threedimension.
"Mario is the figure that must say how the Stereoscopy works without Brille," assured Omar Álvarez, the responsible person for the press specialized on Nintendo in Spain in the idea of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which was developed from the beginning for this console", because until now there were success products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adjustments already existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo underlined that although it was three dimensions, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "switching" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" held two games in one: The first part is "light" to capture the less covered users.
After that, the experts can turn a "two round" about the various games that become more and more difficult.
In real time, users can choose between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects", always have to be played three dimensions.
This trip of Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo switches to the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last expenditure: The snorrowy installer must overcome the platforms that have to be sparked with hazards to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player stood on news in the movements, the environment, the clothings and the enemys - and a "playable" luigi.
Colom bürgt for delivery Portillos in the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would deliver the former governor Alfonso Portillo, so that it would be responsible for the confusion of the money laundering of 70 million US dollars in the United States.
So the process ends on the U.S. application for Portillo, so that it can be courted before it.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision on the independence of jurisdiction and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the issue.
He stressed that during his government, he did not interfere with court decisions and made all the issue requests he was notified.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and severe body injuries, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trade.
The Coloms action is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to suspend the former President of the Statute (2000-2004).
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Court of Justice and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered when its legal situation is clarified in Guatemale and guaranteed for its human rights.
Portillo was released for the submission of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during its government time. This negotiation was predicted for the issue, but the Minister was objecting to contradiction and embraced the case on the New.
Trinieove has helped 6000 young, threatened people from social exclusion
The organization has been called to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinieove Social Assistance Organization have resulted in important results: In this quarter of centuries, 6000 young, threatened people were supported by the social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
During the anniversary of the year, there was a balance in the former works buildings of Fabra i Coats, where over 300 people participated.
In 1986 Trinitat Vella, Trinieove was called to help young people with low training, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the striked celebration in Sant Andreu, many responsible bodies and institutions who worked together with the association in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives in various directions at election campaign times made the inefficiency of the work carried out by Trinieove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parlament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green City Council Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the currently catalone minister of Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinieove was launched in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complex, but he added that the work done until now is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinieove is a example of fighting difficult circumstances and giving people hope in trouble.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he works," he explained.
Consequently occupied house in which giant parties were organised was admitted
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street of Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve householders left the building to have taken without resistance last afternoon.
Everything points out that the Alpine rooms of the neighbors of the house No. 51 have found an end on the street of Balmes.
Twelve people left the building which they had illegally occupied yesterday afternoon and organized enormous festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
After the noise, the door lock was changed to avoid a similar situation.
"After now, the access will be controlled," confirmed the household manager.
The housekeepers who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. In addition they had painted the walls and left all kinds of waste, especially dosings with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, enormous parties who lasted up to two days and driven the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building, there is a diskothek, Balmes 51, which also wore damages.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained Europe Press that her business had been reduced by 80% since the beginning of the household.
The owner of the Discothek pointed out that the householders made their harsh competition, as they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discothek.
In addition, the owner of the recreational was shown by the neighbors because of rest disorders, and according to their statement of noise, the visitors of the disco did not travel, but by the households and in particular by the guests of the festivals who were organized there, and those who were increasingly and longer in the last weeks, according to statements of the intimidated neighbors.
The discothek's responsibilities stated that the complaint had been so large that it had come to the owner of the building to do no rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (Stadt Police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from the neighbors over the last few weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the City Council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week to get the building immediately and to get the problems of civil cohesion and the accommodation of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last months the householders had been in all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. Some had even come to theft.
In this sense, he added that "it was necessary to put an end to crime and to interfere with the social acts in the building."
A further building in the district of Nou Barris was awarded by the Catalan police yesterday.
At 15.30 p.m., the police approached the street Montral No 35 after she received a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to get into the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree, apart from the disputes on the horrors, with the invitation to tender.
The urban tendering over the 16 gate opens the debate on the importance of Colleserola in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the highest point of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published her petition on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in figures with New York Central Park.
With the decline of the CMB in 1987, the park was in the eyes of many again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few not widened in north-South direction but to the top (frank) and below (Meer).
Colleserola's classification as a natural park plays with this idea.
As a example, now no longer served the Central Park, but Yellowstone with Wild Schweinen in the role of the Yogabolic.
As far as the city had been issued in September a giant award, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Of course this is, or someone has the proposal to put gates on the country.
The question itself asks: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The tender is not only organisational, but also in terms of reflection on the city the conversation theme in the mouth of all the architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a receivable subject that two members of this oldly instincted box that meets themselves in the elevator.
And this fact provides the substance for one of the rare agreements between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have acquired the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tendering is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" after the attack on the coast over the "Front on the mountains", as far as the discourse of Ildefon's Cerda, who has been carried over the green apples, is not carried out.
"The principle is that Barcelona is the largest park in the beach.
Among others, because it is well accessible.
Colleserola is more complex," judged the architect, for which the title "Tour of Colleserola" is a "lexic case" in itself: it is not to be "as access to a park, but as a restriction of areas on which it has to be handled."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal as a "intellectual challenge", which is "enige dangers".
Risks due to the "insecurity that brings the design of a public space today" according to the experiences from the 1980s, which had their "switch vocals" in the field of the Forum.
The first fear is the own limit on what may be built.
"Like up always means setting up the next step," i.e. surpassing him.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [referred to the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is close to the question, means simplifying the side of Colleserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not towards Barcelona", and for pure topographic reasons.
Modol reminds that there is already a study by the Patronat de Colleserola that should not "dave ears," although he would be grateful to the city administration that it has given its body the opportunity to participate in this project on the first moment.
He also notes that the nearness of the mountain is to the city of the gender letter, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "twofel" whether this technical profile should lead to the multidisciplinary teams called in life, "the right one," he says, "We should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question was complex in the heading of this article, as Collserola lacked a global view: "There were 16 competitions written in the cross section," he says, "on the Axle Gebirge-Mear. But there is no long-range perspective that views the area in its totality."
This has at least led him to participating in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project would be collected for a gate with that of the architect of the gate.
His opinion should make the city absolutely guarantee that the stripes are so equipped directly above Ronda de Dalt in its entire length that creates a soft transition between city and green zones.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the commandant of the Casino Red freed the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the process leading against him because of discouraged depression.
After 72 days of captivity, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released free after the commander of the Casino Red has forgiven him before the second judgment of the Distrikt, which leads to the process against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey because of impression.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás has been able to see, who forces him to pay a sum of money, so that the city administration authorises the secret operation of the Wetthaus.
After the penalty advocate, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2nd.
After four hours with the ministerial officer of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 to the capital of the Barrio Antigio.
In this place, he stayed 49 days after a second warrant, after the minister of Minister Público had rejected crimes because of orders and organised crimes.
On 19 October he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison event because he had mutanously held the owners of the Casino Red with a half million peso's. On the other hand he remained only a few hours in the central security contract, as murder threatening against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as an insassent of the city prison by San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Distrikt's Second Distrikt, Jorge Yánez, was given a liability regulation. This found that after the almost two months of lasting investigations, sufficient evidence was made to talk to Jonás for the payment of 1.5 million peso's to the representatives of the Wetthaus to open this in return.
This Monday, the commandant of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the Judge José Luis Pecina, to take the punishment to the brother of the mayor, why he is set on free foot in the next few hours.
During the judicial hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the minister of the Court of Justice Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had the damage and which the owner of the Law House expressed his forgiveness. However, the lawyer retained the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is spoken free of charge. In the following cases, no claims may be lodged against the process, and no damage is required.
After hearing the competitor of the Wetthaus by 15.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set on free foot.
Jorge Yánez, the Secretary of the Court, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he had been spoken and that he would put his case to the acts.
He also informed him of the judicial arrangement for immediate release.
The Secretary Dionisio P>>eng<<s Secretary of State, Jácome, gives details of the airplane accident in which Francisco Blake and other seven people were killed.
The Secretaryía de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the research results about the accident in which the Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people were killed, pointed out that the Hubschrauber was directly opposed to the ground without the pilot could have launched an emergency landing.
At a press conference Dionisio P>>eng<<s Jácome, Secretary of Communication and Transport, said that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees in 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the rough, seems to be that the helicopter had several soil contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 insassen, why he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no helicopters were found in the field where the machine had come down.
"When searching, no airplanes were found in other places, the record was the whole structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 insassen, so he met all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area is a stepping of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is priority to get the research results as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Airplanes and Helping Services in Mexico), assured that the Hubschrauber of Estado Mayor Presidencial had fleee with flight speed and the aircraft had fallen on a soft dependence.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the suspension."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, P>>eng<< Jácome, was six relevant points which should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual speed:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight in accordance with the rules for the flight. This means that the team must have had sufficient views during the flight and on the ground.
Refinement conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico, some deeply hanging clouds moved up.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of clouds the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Tracker:
The suspension coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter may not have been a control loss of the aircraft or a deviation from the route before the suspension.
Dispersion of the airplane’s remains in a limited area:
The information available to this time indicates that the helicopter had been exhausted from the straight and sided direction.
The pattern of the scattered plane rests suggested that the helicopter had been stuck up on the ground with its unreasoned structure.
No reference to fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane offer in the accidental location neither let it close on fire nor explosion.
The last research results indicate several soil contacts.
Airplane parts were found in local studies at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The ground is abrupt and shows a screaming of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence where the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several soil contacts.
After a minor search in an area that went beyond the crash site, no scattered airplane parts could be found, which strengthened the assumption that the incredible airplane structure was stirred against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find out the gene of fatty
The Mexico Social Insurance Institute has a research project to find out the gene of fatty in children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituteo Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that a research project aimed at discovering the genetics for fatty in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of fatty in childhood and youth" with which the genetic markers should be found in connection with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Division for Medical Research, Schwerpunkt Biochemie) at the Klinik Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritional specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the post-graduated study course at Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and on Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanceados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interests can come to IMSS' sports in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday at 8.00 p.m. tests are carried out with children and adolescents.
He stressed that the study began at Cuauhtémoc's sports course (in the west of the state of México) and has been continued on the sports site of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
When the goal is achieved from 500 to 600 researchers, the study is continued at the sports site of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the north of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn the factors and the role of genetics in relation to the development of fatty and identifying risk factors of mexican children and young people to prevent chronic therative diseases.
During the world’s day of diabetes, he explained that three thousand children and adolescents of the ages of six to fourteen years should fill in the consent and, under supervision of their parents, nutritional questions.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family disease precautions to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or renal impairment.
In addition, he found that on the Saturdays, the researchers (weight, size, taille number), were controlled by their blood pressure and the blood values such as glucose levels, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (experience of genes in relation to fat lying in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be conducted in the concern of the health person about the alarming weight increase in young people.
"The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 revealed that in almost six years the share of fatty boys increased by 77 percent, and the girl with fat lying has increased by 47 percent. Overweight has also increased dramatically," stressed the IMSS specialist.
He said that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population differs from the other peoples.
He suggested that a Mexican (e) mexican (in) is a average of 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African origin, reflected in the genes related to diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of fat lying are expressed in the inability to burn the surplus of the energy taken to us (Carloria) so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher stated that the direct benefit for the research participants was in a comprehensive investigation of the children in which it would find whether they were a degree of overweight or fatty.
It would even examine the prevention of dark skin folds in the wet and the inner arm (argosis), which indicate the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stadium.
All information would be treated confidentially and inform the parents in writing by the doctors.The doctors explain all the measurement results and propose to them changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for overweight, fatty and other chronic diseases: movement lack, i.e. missing movement in everyday life, the most time of the day to spend before the TV and use transport means instead of walking short paths.
The high calories consumption, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbon hydroates (Tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc.) together with high fat and protein consumption as well as genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents strokes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Chemistry Faculty at UNAM University of Mexicans developed with polymers modified asphalts to make mixing more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If regards the signs that go out of the street bell, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 strokes when the rainy period in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Najera, researchers at the University of UNAM Faculty, warned and assured that if the interpretation and maintenance of the asphalt bears appropriately reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Scall holes from technical views", which he held on the basis of the International Year on Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible developed with polymers modified asphalts to produce a similar mixture to the asphalt, however, which demonstrates a greater mechanical resistance both at high and low temperatures.
Mrera Najera said that this type of modified asphalts should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the northern part of the country, to improve the behaviour of street beams and thus avoiding the appearance of strokes.
He explained that the asphalt - the most serious part of the oil - is a carbon compound, part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalte - and the other part a low - is the so-called malthine. Together they give the street belg its characteristic tastelastic behavior.
The asphalt's counterlastic behaviour means that it maintains at high temperatures of almost 180°C as a fluid, at 120°C it is very countless and almost fixed at 50°C while breaching at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt is not equal on the streets, but on a day depending on the conditions of weather and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer produced.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had, in many cases, a flexible street bell, which consisted of six material layers, of which the last three asphalt included.
Between the upper layers lies a lacquering layer of asphalt, bathed from small, in asphalt, and then fortified stones.
Each single stone of this painting was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles are moving on and creating forces, this layer allows a good distribution of power in the street belly.
"If it was modified asphalt, forces would be even better distributed," the chemical engineer said.
"Over the gorgeous layer," he said, "will explain a last layer, the so-called tragic layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e. from sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
As this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical power than the dish layer and must make friction.
It is also necessary to maintain adequate thickness and the material from which it exists.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are further important factors to take account of, above all things the water," he said, "and it affects the behaviour of the discharge layer significantly.
When the ground is moisted, water insists into the layer and is only difficult to get out again. This causes an evaporation of all layers of the street belly and, therefore, the appearance of stroll holes.
When a hole comes out," he said, "the covering layer will be deducted first, while the dish layer is only affected after it. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be maintained by appropriate maintenance programs at the first signs."
The member in the Sisthema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the appearance of strokes. That is why the thickness of each layer of the street belly should always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation will be maintained to avoid frequent striking holes.
Rafael Herra pointed out that many research work had been waiting for, for example, about asphaltulsions that are even on the market in other countries, and with which the strokes were easy and without use of high temperatures.
What did the candidate de la Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that resulted in the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Columbia.
El Valle receives his 14th Miss title.
Valle del Cauca once again went out empty with the deposit of the Krone for Miss Kolumbien.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner podium, a silver crown and the band that it demonstrates as a new Miss Kolumbien.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took up the Krone and the Zeder, the Departamento already comes to 14 Miss titles and Melina is to the legacy of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the Krone in hands. Among the proklamated misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Wilica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romro (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Olga Marcés Aljure (2008,).
The big question that many today asks is: What was missing?
Because the result is similar to the defeat of a great favorite who had shown at every presentation that she had everything to be the new Miss Columbia. Not least, she was chosen to the queen of the police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, title that also received the beauty kings Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is decisive for the Jury decision to mention it to the first Miss, is that she has not convinced the answer to the question "What book has influenced you most and why?" who was not convinced by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questionr:
"I read much, I think quite in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, I finally believe that the book that was most strong for my childhood, 'The little prince' is a very deep book.
At present, I read `Schuld and Sühne'. It's a book of universal culture that we should read all. I'm just reading a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that 'Leidenschaften' means.
A reply that came to little contradiction, first of all because of the concept's civilization' and second, because she had not explained exactly how every book she had influenced.
But after the ceremony, Melina explained to feel quiet and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people: Please make a little `The little prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite has been burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one who had received all the incidents and who had received all the prices in advance (Gastronomy competition Easter, public agreement on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealously what the Queen stressed that could not shine on stage."
And this was noted at their first idea in the bathing attraction on the beach of the Hilton hotel and at its two traines at the royality celebration.
Although she was sure to get up with both, she lacked the strength and vibration that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned for Miss, "does that the candidate who wins most prices during competition will not eventually become Queen".
In addition, Valle went out to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jurisdiction regarding its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman who engaged in social affairs of their country.
"Security alone is not enough for a Miss Columbia. You must look beyond the body and focus on the social imagination, to ensure that she had already worked before participation in competition in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with its defects of the Derriers and Fibrose, which were noted to her in the stomach. But that is contradictive, because the jury chose as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good diet habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen Trainer, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina had not the best body that it would be better, "but her problem with the fibrose on the stomach that was hard to notice to me, expressed her score on the last day."
During this time, the journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos considers that the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgery she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make her right.
Her body has never been its strong side, and this place had to pay it."
Because of this price, which is first given by the national beauty competition, a cruel prediction was born after the appearance in the bathing suit, which should be true in the night. It was conveyed that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort to avoid leaving it into the enjoyment of the Krone.
No matter whether that is true or not, it is true that Melina, from today on, enters its year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows her to represent on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition of Colombia in one of international competitions.
However, she will be one of the Queens, who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had come into history.
So the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lobphoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On the last 4 November, a Lophoscopic of the investigation unit of the state lawyer (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the leader's identity of FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Army forces of Colombia), one: "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of fingerprints.
From the seven Lophoscopicists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had cooperated willingness service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to enter the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to identify.
In 2000 he moved to Valle over and after the completion of the necessary courses he specialized on Lophoscopy, which is the investigation of the skin that is exposed to frictions, i.e. the hand and foot floors.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was noted to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something great expected him.
On Friday night he fled in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the man who led the oldest Guerrilla of the world could be. Hence he should take the tenfinger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (a actual name).
However, when he reached with the researcher the place where the body was located, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this did not resemble the figures that he had seen in the mass media.
He had no bart, was dressed like a farmer of the area, wasn't wearing a brille and was much thiner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plantkell and a baglight compared Eliazar to the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had just seen it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to tell that it was actually the head of the FARC.
On track search
For a Dactyloskope from Sijín in Cali, it was very important to the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano".
Many people don't know our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopicists do not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
In arrest, many criminals present false evidence papers or do not have any.
We take the fingerprints and look for these in the database.
The researcher told us that at a thief steel he had to take a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had just supported his hand with this place when he exhibited one with jewelry and money.
"Brands are difficult because their surfaces were unable to take fingerprints, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminals who had taken part in several diefstals," he remembered.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be discharged or charged.
A killer was found in front of shortly by snaps bottles.
The investigation suggested that a family member could be suspected to dospicious, and actually a fingerprint agreed on the bottle.
Although this is not guaranteed that it is the murderer, it will be related to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI Dactyloskopist stated that "fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant or a tape will be used for taking.
Afterwards the prints are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the person's office.
"The problem is that there are still many Columbians without evidence papers," said the expert of the CTI.
He meant not all the way it was presented in the SCI TV series.
So as not all gold is what smiles, neither is everything you're looking for, a fingerprint.
But it can be used anyway if you perform a corresponding comparison.
The "committees" calls for the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demons were coincided in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
A large part came up with the spacious command and changed his location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement called out the authorities of New York on this Tuesday when they tried to enter the Manhatten Square after they had been cleared from the place in the morning and tried to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demons were encouraged to provide access to the Zuccotti-Platz, where they had a judicial arrangement that allowed the "empowers" to provide the new tent in this place, while another part of the movement to the spatial command was held and occupied a park further north in the city where it came to nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with seats and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray suggested that the answer of the "empowers" to the remembrance of her tent camp, direct ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to the court, where the Judge Lucy Billings issued an arrangement which prohibited the violent raising of the place and approved the tent.
The "Empears" also occupied a new park, which is located on the crossing of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue entirely near the entrance to the Holland Tonnel, New York and New Jersey, and is property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to order the place for at least one hour, but then the police met and arrested some of the demons, although Bray could not give the exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that there were hundreds of people in this place, where religious leaders were also invented as signs of their support to the members of the movement and to convey with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti-Platz (a site in private property) is closed in expectation of a judicial hearing that is still established for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the spare taken in the morning should be analyzed.
Some of the demons driven from the place carried photokopies of this judicial arrangement and distributed them. They even gave them some police who guarded the place, which led to "a few small collapses", as Bray reported that they had shown, some police forces had hit demons.
The judicial instruction forbids the authorities to clear members of Occupy Wall Street from the place and the application of "Sets adopted after the occupation and forbid that the demons have returned to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg stated in the press that, due to this judicial arrangement, the reopening of the space for public transport and demonstration was renewed. The demons he pointed out that the city law did not allow them to re-establish with tents and sleeps at that place.
The mayor personally defended the roaming of the Zuccotti square, where almost 200 persons were arrested, which was decided because the demons were "criminated against the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the arrangement for the opening of the place because it had "changed into a place where people did not demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," because "a single business had been threatening" and the residents feared "to their quality of life".
"The rape in the morning was exaggerated and shows that Bloomberg is in principle interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of the North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor "do not respect the freedom of the press".
The "Occupy Wall Street" responsible for organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with municipal organizations and unions, to remember the two months that the protests last since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the virgin Mary in the TV-Weihnachtsshow
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian famousities, it will occur on December 1st, in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadierin Pamela Anderson was TimAll wizard in "Home Improvement", rescue sister in "Baywatch", Rabbit at "Playboy", the woman of Rockmusic Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the virgin Mary at a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
Today, the private television channel CTV announced that Anderson will occur together with the "crooner" (Balladensänger) Michael Bublé and other Canadian famousities on December 1st, in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will enjoy a very special virgin Mary life.
Today, CTV spread images from the television program, where Anderson - which also appears for the dissemination on the Internet of a self-rotated pornos, in which she, together with her former husband, the actuator of "Mötley Crue", Tommy Lee, appears - as a virgin Mary with a pope to represent Jesus.
In the scene Peters, a well-known Canadian committee of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" mission by Charlie Sheen, when Jesuskind.
The Christmas program of CTV does not only apply to Anderson and Peters, but also to the Canadian singer Bublé, the end of March in Buenos Aires married the architectural model Luisana Lopilato, which is not far from this controverse.
During one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had recently referred to the North American Kim Kardashian as "Hure".
Japan is born again after the earthquake
The GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since the last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which has still been in genesing after the destructive earthquake that was in an atomic crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced the 2nd World War.
The first estimates of the Government in Tokyo assessed the damages to $3,000, which seem to be deteriorated despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of lasting case, the data on gross domestic product came to the end of this chapter from July to September: the GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the quotas counted up to the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan starts the financial year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
Reconstruction can be declared partly by machine sales for the reconstruction of the territories destroyed by the earthquake and the following Tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decline by 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease in six months was inevitable.
However, the actual change of the Japanese economy is not only based on keynsian infringements that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan is awaited in particular by the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, infringed by the growing expenditure for vehicles, travel and leisure jobs.
The stigma of Yen
Tokyo has trusted the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - flew into one of the "accessional currencies" of the investors who flew before the eurozone debt crisis and the trick forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that, like a gravestone, is liable to export companies' accounts.
With a harder currency, the products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, brought their weak business results back from July to September to the notation of Yen.
While the markets continue to camp the peripheral EU countries, the Government of Yoshiko Noda remains vigilant.
"We need to respect the continued risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the fast upgrading of Yen," said yesterday the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown clear signs for slowing economic development in September.
The indicator of the world economy’s turnpoints revealed that the largest economic potential would have drawn the brakes.
Because he fell by four tenths to about 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone is even below this average value, which is 100 after it is dropped by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens resumes doubts
Papadios says that the spare measures would be adopted, but conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums driven by the peripheral countries and broadening insecurity, Greece continues to disappear in the Labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consense" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real belief of political forces, is slowly addressed by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Luke Papadios, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days of his appointment may be too short for its implementation, the leaders of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will support the new saving measures and not, in any case, take up his requests to the proposed date, 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," papadimos assured yesterday for opening a Parliamentary debate that will reach its high point of confidence tomorrow for the new government.
A package of 24 employment programmes, reform of civilian law and new measures against tax immigration are the first initiatives.
Yet, Samara's communication does not declare the doubts about his attitude: "We have committed us to support the transitional government but not to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism, which needs to unlock the 8 000 millions of Athens, and stated that he would not approve obligations on the fulfilment of saving measures.
But the European Commission, which has still been irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that it would not be asking: economic assistance would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties would not be "as soon as possible to sign a clear written agreement".
The speaker of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that the inspectors of the Troika will come back to Athens soon to discuss with the new government, "what for the payment of the sixth section" of 8 000 million euros, although there is not yet an final date.
The Greek pepper still has for a while.
Queen Sofía: "This are tools for progress and hope"
The queen stressed the predominant position of Spain regarding this kind of financing
Spain has reached a predominant position in the role of microfinancing worldwide.
The Queen Sofía of Spain last night reminded Spain that over the last two decades, the second donor has developed for this means for international cooperation, and that "Wese" is a "instruction for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of human trust".
She was convinced that it would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to achieve thousands of goals from the United Nations until 2015 and, in particular, the number of persons living with income of less than one dollar per day, i.e. under the "Armutsgrenze".
Spain "works also" at the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is responsible for this task," noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will take place by the summit that lasts to Thursday, "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" are guaranteed as the main beneficiary of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "is faced with many challenges."
The Summit on Minst Credits is not only a forum for debates but also a platform for the objection of two fundamental objectives.
The Queen stated that until the end of 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households are exceeded the poverty limit.
The conception of smallest credits goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which the Queen Sofia judges as a "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financing instrument described it as a "mainworthy idealists who have devoted themselves to the fight against poverty" and whose work it has been since 15 years when the queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy locally.
According to this experience, one year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings at the Ivoorkus in 1999 and Canada in 2006. At all, "We can see a continuous development," the Queen, whose commitment for this project was last made their assessment as the "familial Head" in Valladolid and as the "Freater of Armen".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her lecture by animating attendants to participate in the debate and seeking solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "a ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid at times of economic trees, while it was a "pleasing commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that smallest credits were a "first and rigorose policy for the eradication of poverty", and that the governments of the industrial states should now work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria and not allowed the solidarity of the crisis to fall.
For Spain, smallest credits are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Sorayař, accused "the success", "marginalized" people, "who stand always before closed doors" "Hoffnung" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, was welcomed by the attendings in a city, "their gates of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to choose the EU President due to the general vote
The first day of the Christian Democrat Congress (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not planned in the programme, but has been carried out in the autumn, particularly in order to ensure that those activists are sufficient to estimate government policy on the Greeks today and perhaps in the morning as too lax.
The Presidential request proposed by the Bureau was almost unanimously adopted.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted, ten had been contained in the vote.
The several minutes ongoing standing Ovation, which was first due to its intervention, Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, were no doubt open by the three European ministers of Finance.
The President-in-Office's main ideas - as well as the applications - are the following slogans: the response to the crisis is" not less but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also "new million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be expressed by a strengthening modification of the Lisbon Treaty as regards the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, but this could also be the basis for the European Commission's president's choice on the basis of a general vote' to give Europe a face."
This is, however, in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which were clearly Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Surely it is only little probable that 47 is quickly on this revolution some: Gross-Britannia is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
In a overwhelming majority, the delegates also rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which evidently breached the position of Germany.
Thus, the President-in-Office thought of the climate within its party has strengthened the reference points on Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it has no longer tried to gain their convention at the expense of the "little" or those in difficulty European countries who would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the Europe application of the meaning of "German-French friendship" devotes a section, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
Facticly one of the highest humbling precipitations of the Napoleonic Army.
What does the fraud represent in health notifications?
Following the family aid, UMP and government are now attacking the health messages.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux, to visit a family aid case and to present a speech on the issue of social fraud, and economic dependence from the state since 2007.
In order to meet this attack, which is aimed at entrusting the economy in a hardness test, however, on the other hand, does not represent a less prohibitions of the right presidency campaign, the majority will concentrate on workers' health reports.
First of all with budgetary objectives: the government shall identify the introduction of a fourth carraction day before taking into account a health report on workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick workers would lose the wage of four days without the consent of the specific company, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure that would threaten wrath according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" but would help bring 280 million euros.
And those who went into a more symbolic character with another measure: to the government officials, in a unforgettable carcity day in the case of disease (at the same time there is for them, in contrast to the three carcity days in the private sector, no caring period).
While these questions are in the discussion, the majority also simplify the fraud topic, aiming at the abuse associated with labour absence.
"Controllen will be essentially important, and beyond it are to be compensated if this is asked," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November before the sender's microphone RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report in respect of the reality of fraud in the area of diseases appear to be a little disproportionate.
This is indeed subject to permanent monitoring since 2002, as well as political offensives, which have worn the most frequent fruits.
The French are not more frequently sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, first of all we live with the country-wide numbers.
According to the CNAM Landeskrankenkasse, more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health in 2008, the daily inventions represented 11,3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
Under this amount, 46% were related to maternity leave as well as labour accidents and 54% regarding disease leaves, which is 6.2 billion euros.
And then 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French were granted only 14.5 health days to the average of 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
A mean value that is different from certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com website for career planning, revealed that 75% of the 40 000 asked French workers have not taken a single day of sickness.
Another study recorded this time by the health insurance is clear that 37% of the health reports were shorter than 8 days in 2010; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one to three months and 11% over.
In comparison with their European neighbours, therefore, French workers no longer tend to work incompatibility.
In 2010, a long-term study conducted by two researchers of the French State Center for Science Research (CNRS) showed that the global rate of absence (or otherwise based) oscillated between 1994 and 2001, in France between 10% and 11% by 20% by 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in health notifications represents a decisively small proportion in relation to black work.
With regard to the truck, only a weak exhaust is reached here.
The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 brings to the fact that there are systmatic controls in health notifications exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM (public education and training of technicians and engineers) found less than 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 28,000 realised, short-term diseases, which are heated in 37,050 cases, were unjustified or too long."
In the systematicly controlled disease cases of more than 45 days, under 1.2 million 11% were "inappropriate or unjustified" cases, which are 132.000.
In total, therefore, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have made a health report applying.
A digit represents only a weak excavation, for example, those of black work.
According to the UMP-Deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report published in July on this question, this is a figure of between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily fees, and thus much more than the defraudation with the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to catch its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had announced before Parliament that the government of the Union did not allow a hundred days to perform that task.
"In order to continue the efforts to build the economy, we need support for our European partners and a new budget adaptation programme," said the Head of the Government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's trust rate on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the European Conference on 27 October is the "Haupt Task" of the new government, as the participation of the country within the Eurozone was added to the game.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the state deficit of the country" the 9% of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% and in 2009 at 15.7%.
Rights reject the new Sparma's receipts
Antonis Samaras, head of the right flyer, had given his consent to the already approved ma's on an attempt to escape the debt crisis on Monday, but had predicted that his party would not be ready for an additional saving.
"We won't vote for new measures," he said on the occasion of a parliamentary meeting of his Party New Democracy.
He had been prepared to reduce budget deficit and debt as well as to fight against pollution, however, any policy which would interfere with economic conspiracy was hostile.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary activities of the EU Commission, who had prevented IWF and EU to grant the necessary loans over 8 billion euros not without a written guarantee of all parties on their support of the planned measures, had Antonio Samaras answered that his word would be enough and he would not sign anything under pressure of Auñen.
Euthanation and accompanied release must be legalized, such as a expert body
The Canadians live in refusal of death, as revealed by a report of the Royal Society of Canada
The body stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors working together with regard to painlindering treatment to provide the best painful means, and this also go beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal toward death.
Only 9% of the Canadians are able to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and take dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposed report of the Royal Society of Canada, which were involved in six experts associated with various special areas, including Ethics, Law and Medicine.
This body recommends the government to amend the penal law of this kind to allow accompanied suicide and euthania where the choice is made, in patients who are considered to be able to take such a decision.
As an act, the experts quote a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which compared the death quality in 40 countries of the earthball.
Although Canada has placed on the 10th ranking, the study notes that "the medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people fear to cut the theme of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to pain-stilling means, so the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada report us.
And despite the majority of the Canadians' desire to die at home, however, 68.6% of these die in the hospital last.
From the whole country, the rate of 86% of deaths entered in the hospital in Quebec was the highest.
The cheerful question regarding Euthania and accompanied suicide concludes that the authors of the report want to make any amendments to the criminal law on euthania and accompanied suicide are contradicted to the position of the federal government, which has already made.
But now, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries, whose approach to Euthania and accompanied suicide has been legalized or decriminated, there is no evidence that such decrimination would be mixture in their application, i.e. the implementation of Euthania or accompanied suicide of non-competent persons.
On the contrary, there are much more cases in which such transgressions were not legalized in countries where Euthania and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report yesterday, was confirmed at a tele conference.
"Euthanation is practiced in Canada where it is clearly illegal."
"Every accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadier forgive the Euthania
According to angus recital survey in 2010, we have already made 85% of the Canadians in favour of Euthania, since they feel that these people allow people to milden their suffering at the end of their life course.
And 66% believe that the fact that the legalisation of Euthania does not result in giving the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valued.
As regards those who have already practiced a accompanied suicide, the surveys represent 41% the opinion that they should not be prosecuted criminally.
As regards maintaining or setting up the resources in patients, situation is less clear, the authors of the report.
It also suggests in its Recommendation Directory that the criminal law should indicate that the deposit of the funds for which a legal refusal has been provided should not be criminal.
The expert body also calls on experts to be trained in the task of respecting a deposit of funds at the end of life and to fear without criminal persecution.
The body stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together with regard to painlindering treatment in order to prepare the best painful means, and this also go beyond cancer cases.
Recently, the body calls on the resources used in the Canadian Institutions for healthcare widely to be used for pain immigration or life-absorption to consider them at least, as they were not as much as the Euthania was used to reduce physical pain and to tackle them on the same procedures.
Preservation of other experts
Some experts in the legal area of health have already presented prerequisites with regard to the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described the position of reporting experts, including "extreme", because it did not set any limits on the euthanation practice in the final phase.
"This opens the pforts for a situation where everyone who is lifetime and older than 18 years of age is to ask another person to help him be with his suicide," says RA Dessamp, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility on all other values involved in the social effect of the society.
But now, he says, it would be "lines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist for health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" towards the conclusions of the report which it titulated as "Pro-Euthanation Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who itself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports concerning non-favoured abuses in certain countries in which Euthania and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls President Assad for power
Damascus prangs to "Complot"
Syria is more isolated
The Baschar al-Assads participants have demonstrated the authorities of the Au's Ministry yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Baschar al-Assads, which, however, resists this, thanks to the support of Russia and pointed out to the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the exclusion of Syria through the Arab Liga, the European Union has reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken place in favour of a retirement by President Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordania last night was the minister of Arab Prime Minister who asked President Baschar al-Assad to lay down his office power in Syria", in which the 40 civilians and members of the government's power have already been killed.
"Lear Baschar's interest in his country would come down, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of the political Syrian life," said the king of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in a interview with the BBC.
On the other hand, the Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davutoglu had accused that the Turkish mediation attempts had not been successful since the beginning of the year.
"The people in the Middle East who cannot be in peace with their peoples and do not have to be satisfied, must go," he stated in the reference to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey takes a more steady stirring attitude.
On the other hand, the United States have welcomed the "consensation of the consensus against Assad and the creations of the Syrian regime" due to the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Community, United States, EU, Arabic Liga and countries like Turkey have beaten an ever more intensifying tone in Syria," said Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of government power have come to death in the region of Dar'a in the southern Syrians, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH stated.
According to this NGO, two other civilians have come to life in the camped city of Hom, "Sustchanging and heavy bombing attacks for Jobar."
At a press conference, the Syrian Auction Trade Minister Walid al-Mulim still considers that the country "taxes to the end of the crisis".
He has also responded to the decision of the Arab Liga, Damascus, to suspend his tasks, which represents his estimation according to a "birth step".
Syria would not imitate," he added under the defense that "the complicated against Syria would fail."
According to the Suspendation Decision Syrias, the Arab Liga is currently investigating a "Schutzmechanism for Civilists" and wishing to dispatch 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, media and military observers into the country.
The French auʹn Juppé trade Minister, Alain Juppé, also expressed himself in favour of the dispatch of UN observers to protect civilians from repressions of the regime, that he is still in his "Paranoia" to be protected.
A new meeting of the Liga is planned in discount tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the plan adopted on 2 November, but, in particular, the envisaged, expected deduction of military forces from the camped cities and the liberation of imprisoned demons.
The Russian Minister of Aurea Sergej Lawrow has considered the decision of the Arab Liga yesterday as "uncorrect" to guard against the support of any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already encouraged Syria to implement the crisis increase plan.
Italy
Monti calls on markets for patience and Italy for sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian Head of State, asked for a little more time from the markets to make its stab and implement a programme that "Opfer" requests to restore the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Government of Berlusconi.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's conflict of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to commit a cabinet to Parliament, which is relatively strictly strictly composed of external technicians.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," says Francesco Nucara, Members of one of the many smaller, participating parliamentary groups after meeting with the President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Auditors, had waited on the other hand that Mario Monti puts a trust jurisdiction to Parliament until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The votes will be flipped in the presentation presented by M. Monti, which will doubtless reach a dozen from ministers to the head of Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented, the scattered nervousity of the stock and obligation markets demanded their time.
In a democracy there are certain deadlines, to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it was "certain that the markets will be constant and sound.”
His order by the President was received from the markets, but the unruhe was reinforcing it again, especially after an unexpected industrial production decline in the euro area in September.
The minister of Prime Ministers was supposed to establish a stab of predominant technicians, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government should be estimated until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Member States, the new government should receive Parliament's trust evidence until Friday.
M. Monti has been obliged to make Italy the "erneous protagonists" in Europe since its function has been taken up.
An EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "without changing our diagnosis to the Italian economy itself, taking into account the new government".
The EU, who is convinced that, despite the saving plans taken up in these last months, Rome has not achieved its goal of budgetary compensation in 2013, has requested new hardship measures.
Emma Marcegaglia", Chefin of the Chiefs, Italys, who will meet on Tuesday at Monti, is also on the need for economic ancillation, where a country that has no growth that cannot respect defizitary characteristics".
M. Monti, known for his competence and its independence as the EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "epoch change" Italy after 17 years"Berlusconism; the "Professor" symbolizes the "requirement of trustworthyness" as well as a "other Italian" authors.
The big unknown of this was the long-lasting of his stabe.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preliminary elections since Italy has now come up for 200 billion euros from April 2012.
Russian scientists help the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a spatial capsel used with a nuclear weapon, confirmed on Monday a nuclear risk specialized, American NGO.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report published by the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents submitted by this UN Agency for the investigation of this scientist.
The AIEA had reported its "people concern" last week on the basis of a "possibly military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to a study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko had been born in 1934 for three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was supposed to have left the centre to establish a company in Kiev that is "Nano-Diamanten".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him in 1995 to contact the Irish Embassy in Ukraine.
He then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before his return to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA's strong evidence was that the Iranian development of a nuclear preliminary system was supported by the work of an foreign expert who had worked not only in this technology but also, as a Member of the Agency said, worked his entire professional career directly at the military nuclear program of its country of origin."
Anti-islamic crimes and delicates have increased by 50%
The crimes and delicates addressed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated crimes have been easily reduced or only reduced according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these data, the total number of force crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, so by 49%, while 13% of the increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decline in Jews and a global increase in 14% of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total ciffer "hassmotivated crimes" has risen in very weak case to 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by race differences and 20% by religious differences motivated crimes, says the FBI.
"After a deterioration in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes again," stressed the human rights organization of Human Rights First".The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights first had been emphasized for a long time that the violence oriented against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, should be considered to be serious versus human rights," said Paul Legendre, an organization responsible.
"The U.S. government can and should do more for fighting these offences," he added, in the opinion, that this could be carried out under the improvement of the police attitude toward "hass crimes".
The "hass crime" represents civil rights in the United States as an inheritance from the epoch of battle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violence against racial, skin color, religion or origin, and now also involves sexual contradictions.
Twitter walks the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter has introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform to enable users to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service even more like Facebook.
The new tab "activity" and another "Name" enables better reader live follow-up of other "Twitter" activities, the Internet user whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and tracking your messages.
This allows you to find out whether they allow you to follow their messages, whether they subscribe to new contributions, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general Internet dissemination on Monday" at a low percentage of users in August, the Twitter-Sprecher Carolyn Penner indicated before the French press agent AFP.
Twitter was well known for his little instinctive function, consisted of something esothericly mutating text (RT to refer to the contribution of another person). follow-up friday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) fasant le bonheur of the initial, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec unmaniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux Grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed with the help of certain "Tweets" on the Internet about this innovation.
"This is inappropriate, stirring and equal to very Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function" activity will help me to follow certain elements of my flux twitter better," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Instruction of a "Golden budgetary regulation" to the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic and Christian Coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "golden budgetary rule" into the constitution to reduce public deficits and to avoid a possible degradation of rating agencies in Austria's Top-Bonity (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the Council's outcome, although the public government's debt is 74.6%, so far above the criteria laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payability would not fall on a turn of AA+ to AA+, we should pay three billion euro interest rates each year", said Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister.
Austria also takes a request from the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government at that time had required the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public account balance in the constitution or by determining a equivalent law.
The time to take by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country that had taken such a "rule" rule into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (BIP) each year, since 2017, the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, whereas regional states should show balanced budgets as well as municipalities.
In the horizon of 2020/21, the budgetary debts should be eliminated under the 60% criteria set out in the Maastricht Agreement.
Stark Yen
Noda is threatening a new intervention on monetary markets
On Tuesday, the Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiko Noda warned that the Japanese official force would intervene again on monetary markets if the Yen should continue to rise.
"If we place an excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the Yen, we will also intervene as we have done it last time," said M. Noda in the Senat.
On Tuesday, the Yen was close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
This day, Tokyo had sold massive Yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese deviation value that has been taxing a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
However, the Yen has risen regularly on the basis of purchases by investors who view the Yen as "sufficient" in these unsafe times of world economic deterioration and guilt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has been broken under the symbolic late of 105 yen near the levels that had entrusted the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 Yen, the euro over 160 Yen.
This strohfire of Japanese devise damages the exports of the archiple, as it defends the costs of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan is fighting after the earthquake and the Tsunami on March 11, which has destroyed the Tohoku (Northeast) region for its rebuilding," stresses M. Noda, who fears that this tender could kill the weak upturn already in the cemetery.
The third economic power has won with the growth in the third quarter of -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time this year, thanks to the profitable export increases and the consumption of the budgets "ploated" by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the Temperation of the Yen does not reflect the economic foundations of Japanese.
On the other hand, the Minister for Finance Jun Azumi invited the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a second day meeting of its Monetary Committee on Tuesday, to take all thoughtful measures to dismiss the Yen.
Hireide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has noted, however, that the BoJ has already initiated "repeated" and reads that on Wednesday he would not expect an additional currency locking.
At the final meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its State bond purchases by $5,000 billion (47 billion) to detach the 55.000 billion Yen (519 billion euros) covering amounts which they had used for various purchases of financial titles to exceed the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interesting fastenes in height, stocks make retreaters
The risk of infringement of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European figures.
Despite the adoption of the new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the Councils of weakened countries continue to rise constantly.
The stock exchanges that are still concerned with the stability of the euro area also fought this Tuesday, the 15th November, even a little more in negative pounds.
In Paris the CAC lost at 10 p.m. 1.4% and fell to 3.064 points.
The dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London was 0.1%.
"According to the new tensions in respect of government bonds in the difficulty of the euro area, the global share markets continue to release their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the infectious risk," explains Terry Pratt, institutional IG markets quoted by the press agent Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo, which, on its part, suffered in the renewed fear of market participants as regards the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continued to continue, had closed with a cry of 0.7%.
"Japan has directed its eyes to Europe as well as the rest of the world, and trade is moving to limited variation corridor, as long as the investors have no evidence of stabilisation of the situation," estimates Mitsushige Akino, Fund manager at Ekiyoshi Investment Management.
This retirement of the concern about the future of the euro area damages the unit currency that continues its bais on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
By 10 p.m. the European Valuta was 1.3570 dollars worth, so it was 0.4%.
According to the Börsenmaklers, after the CDU, party of Angela Merkel, who had gathered on Monday in the convention, she has taken a request that, in particular, provides for the possibility of entering out the euro area in difficulty countries without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish councils are far below the 6% limit.
Italy and Spain's loan rates are still at very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the renting of the Italian bonds reached 6.85%, which had grown to 6.2% of the Spanish title.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian Head of State Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the meeting of the Eurozone on 27 October were "the main task" of its government.
Spain is in the fishermen of the markets, as Parliament's elections take place on Sunday in the country.
However, the "spread" interest rate between the German and Spanish 10-years has reached a new historical high.
Expected growth rates of the euro area
Statistically, France booked a financial growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had redirected the cash of the figures of the second quarter, with a minimum of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that is most disturbed by economic experts.
On the other hand, Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first high accounting of the euro area is expected at 11 p.m. while the EU Commission warns the risk of a re-recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win about dogmen
Exists a topic that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or by emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take a vote on the occasion to reflect on this subject and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it suspends the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should find their views on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is a double of electricity demand until 2050, an enormous proportion of the world's population should not have to stop a vital element of life.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce fossil resources in order to continue to produce continuous electricity without the imperative need for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, forgotten from the ecological debate to fight against climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Germany therefore continues to remain isolated in his decision to stop nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision the need to find a substituteable source, or in Switzerland, which is just intended to build only or to build core power plants of the last generation.
Gross Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to mention only some countries, continue to follow their projects with decisiveness.
On the other hand, after Fukushima, the United States have decided to launch a further unit to their park by re-enterprise the work of Three Mile Island after the nuclear accident.
However, even if the German model on renewable energy sources is sometimes set as a example, the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be defensed by the defense of the electricity price, a reinforced energy dependence, increased by the increase in import gas, especially from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and carbon power plants.
The totality of these unfriendful effects will already be remarkable within few months.
The case of Denmark gives the opportunity to think.
Denmark is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy, its CO2 output and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average value.
Thanks to the resistance of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity account in contrast to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy represents a key role in competitiveness and a stability force of the industry on national grounds, the French companies have a benefit due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Each significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore draw a strong increase in the energy price, which will read the generous statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of the purchasing power to illusion.
Surveys revealed that the price that the large majority of the French people are as little to pay is ready to resist the principle of this energy source.
We are aware that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build a industry industry with 125.00 direct and 41.000 induced jobs.
As a result of its strong export charter, it brings a lot of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creative jobs.
If France had the decision to get out of nuclear power, the large part of these SMEs would fall victims, and the annual 6 billion euros would be more and more combined with investment and nuclear energy exports.
What electrician would be commissioned to function for sixty years, when the fall of its producer is preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, it must be clear that there is as little one as a devil work a miracle for the production of electricity.
The CO2-arm solutions developed by the company Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are tested by the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest level of safety to be maintained is absolutely imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority that performs uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have made themselves a name for their professionality, are right to take part of the safety provision.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disorders.
Only one single in Three Mile Island has entered under normal operating conditions, so he did without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Tschernobyl, the drama was resurrected by reactor construction, as well as infinite, human failures.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural catastrophes was never provoked day-of-day masses that caused the death of several ten thousand people.
The core industry will draw its teachings out of this accident as it had done after the two previous.
As the fruit of this approach and the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and engineers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft which enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered to be a desired value among the electrical technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a building stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them free railways to travel the lead position in the unsuitable nuclear power development.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be unreasonable to let emotions, dogmen and party men dominate a debate that determines as well as economic, social and financial situation in our country.
Is immigration Latest or Chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overloading police, courts and administrative bodies due to the figures of policy, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "governmental country of human rights", as France himself had stated.
Recently, the complaint against foreign students had marked the weekly views, the Minister of Interior had readily stated (see Libération of May 23), that France "no talents, Maurer or Cellner from abroad need".
But this policy was only rarely analysed from the economic point of view.
There is a far-reaching consensus between rights and links.
On the right side, Jacques Chirac's sound was attacked, which had explained in 1976 that "1000,000 unemployed workers, including more than 2 million immigrated workers, would not face a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had presented in 1990, France" couldn't take up the entire poverty of the world."
The only difference is in the degree of greyness
The fear of the invasion of the national soil through Horden of Polish clepper was divided from both right and left in 2005.
Of both camps, the immigrants were observed as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of greyness, which is to be established to the immigrants.
Francois Hollande is limited to his programme on banitarians, which point out that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration, as a problem, may affect choices, but it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron are present in a recently published work that summarizes the latest knowledge regarding immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), among the specialists, there is a broad consensus regarding the positive influence of immigration on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that these threats are to be substituted by pressure on their wages, particularly those less qualified.
However, the experience shows that the immigrants in truth are more significantly complementary than the local wage workers, as they exercise difficult work in sectors which are technically unloaded.
The smaller qualified immigrants are working in sectors, which are not traveling local wage workers, which are more qualified among the immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not qualified to work.
Positive wage Effect
As a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country in which anaesthesists lack, this complementarity also affects the immigration of wages and national labour market situations between local and migrants.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigration resulted in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of idea added by immigrants and economic growth is admissible (hohe share of an immigrants under American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute to the social systems in which European countries are cut about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Works Organization estimates that a person who is working in the age of 30 to Germany spends a net contribution to the public household over its lifetime (income minus expenditure) of around $150,000.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring the missing cutpoints to his mandate with teeth.
However, these emigration teeth, which should distort the immigrations, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has found democracy, now remains to face European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good, also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember, who, after its invention in Athens over two thousand years ago, had been able to pass on the tragedy of World War I, Totalitarianism, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some have probably believed that it was rich to exercise the right of voice, in the direct way possible to see democracy for all times above their enemies.
One knows since Napoleon" the little," that it was a characteristic of mind.
The general electoral law, which is necessary for democracy, is not sufficient condition and can become as well as the "depression instrument" as it then expressed the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of violence, training, enlightenment, economic and social Community spirit, a legal statement.
The crisis in Europe, where we are, is a economic crisis, but it is just as very and always a political and democracy crisis.
In this respect, the attitude of the Greek true-falsch referendum had been doublely clear: once the need for a powerful return of politics, but on the other hand also to those of the disturbing feeling of their inability, their inappropriateness.
This ambitiousness should be considered overholt.
Truly, today the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to win in order to encourage the success of the national referendum, which was organised in depending on the needs and in the wrong order.
A free light for the European single ruler or a jump with related eyes into the empty of the nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizens of the state!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, with full law, clarified and steady, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crisiss in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - but we do not know where to end the record - as there is only one crisis, and it exists in Europe.
It is all Europe, which is defeating the dictate of markets and rating agencies, which suffers under its imperfection and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe, which is humiliated at international level.
It is disturbed about sovereignty transfers towards Europe - all Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and so that every individual of the nations associate him.
The urgency is to return to the national sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
For it is totally obvious that Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, make free from the markets and can train a future through investment.
The rise from the crisis has decisions at European level to the condition that cannot be taken without the total democratic justice without any doubt to lead us into corruption.
After this proposal was contested by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, everyone today urges European economic leadership.
Understanded.
However, without political integration and more democracy - as it proposes to citizens - it would be a new foolishness and a further baggage.
We have to take a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it needed the fact that Republicans were "created".
The revolution of the interests alone could not be enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must make a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically more democratic Europe, a truly European sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become the general good
The world fair for chip cards opens its gates on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic position on Tuesday.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an increase of 11% worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card telephone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that enables payments in public transport or equation of purchases by simply keeping the map at a reader.
Over the one year, 320 million sold before, this year should be sold 460 million contactless chip cards worldwide!
Their market share should continue in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe gains in terms of contactless payment to soil after it has been behind the region of Asia-Pacific for a long time.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75.000 payment terminals accept these.
In France the beginnings are more modest: Only 40,000 non-contact fishermen have been spread.
However, consumer markets do steam.
Carrefour has therefore emitted 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
To exceed the speed of the banks, it is now necessary that the banks pay their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have been obliged to hand their customers systematically out bank cards that are in contact with contactless chips," announced Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Testing banks payment by phone
This is only a first stage on the way to pay the means of the future: the mobile phone.
A loss of less percentage of devices is now equipped with the NFC technology necessary for carrying out these transactions (Near Field Communication).
"You're in delay."
"But they should experience a real upward development at least next year."
"We expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June next.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are intended to be equipped with a capsule to allow contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Générale had declared yesterday to prepare the launch of a offer that allows their customers to make contactless payment by phone.
Terrorist face understands, from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is disturbed about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the secrete Boko Haram.
The long-term relationships between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Labour Minister Abdelrahmen Messahel had confirmed that Algiers has now gained "wissness".
"The way to deal with both organisations and the relationships of secret services points to a clear cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigations on the kidnapping of two French in Niger have promoted interfaces at days.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were in a restaurant in Niamey by the Aqmi members of the Aqmi, should have been killed on the following day, at the same time as several of their entrepreneurs at the time of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian mediators want to find several telephone chips in the trunks in the site of use which were the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the phone calls leads to several conversation partners stationed in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the mediators are particularly interested in the numbers of two conversation partners: A number leads to a Nigerian who has long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, who had stopped wheat by Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is close to the Aqmi and the secret.
"This is a progress, but you must doubtless wait for more clear evidence before you can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"It's thinkable, however."
"It has been known for years that the secrete refers to financial and intellectual support of Aužen and that it is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher, Kunle Amuwo, milds off.
In these recent months, these "supporting services" have become more and more augentic during their past years, as well as the talks and the operational modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the deduction of suicides, as well as the use of ever more complex spraying agents, carrying the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community to begin with Washington has been pressured on Abuja since this time so that we can take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, indeed, deemed the group over the Community of Illuminates that should not be given special attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, school, and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means as much as "the Western education is a shame" - pursues the creation of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediumless region, the merger comes rapidly.
It politizes and demands strict compliance with the Scharia, while its shared activists are engaged in fighting against the wicked central government.
The activists at first have churches, bars and authorities in the Visian.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active with their stronger attacks against the Commissioners.
The reaction from Abuja is, however, as usual, individual.
The army surrounds the city, one is 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect will look radical and leave its high citizens in the north.
Last Christmas she was known to a attack in Jos, which demanded 80 human life, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the guilty of a suicide of suicide, which was found in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations is a key international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania to Somalia, has been disturbed by all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger have occupied the Somaliians of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week,ta Alain Juppé has warned before Boko Harem at the time of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan, in Nigeria, and has been ready to share all the indications."
The world corresponds to the republican Presidential candidates
In the midst of Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rivalize in simplification and uncertainty regarding China, Iraq and the aid for Israel.
Can a crying-sensitive America have a complex world with simple to not say: do some ideas lead?
If you listen to the Republican Presidency candidates this way, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Midt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their contestors have repeatedly made their deceasable statements and their statements regarding Au's Politics, traditional republic focus.
About China, Iran and Israel's help - often in no way slogans.
As regards the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest in the course, Romney threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to look at the "electoral manipulation" - leading issue in a America that is the most elevated to Asia through the migration of whole industries.
He said, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassadors in China under Obama and only candidate who seems to have an extended vision of Au's politics, has snatched the air nearly with regard to his emotions of melting gebaren.
He had called a hand-feste but constructive conversation exchange with Beijing (except the current position of Obamas).
But Huntsman is not listening, as he stagnates in the depths of opinions.
Reagan's Eben Image
Romney also praised military slapping against Iran if sanctions were to fail to stop the nuclear programme.
"When I was chosen, I commanded Iran E Content," he had gotten.
"When Obama is chosen again, they get the bomb."
He promised Israel to strengthen military aid and accused Obama to be guilty of this partner against obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, secondly placed candidate, is considering an embarrassing act inadequate knowledge.
Recently, he cried out to give the Chinese military threat of Kontra, because Beijing's attempts to develop an nuclear power" - and seemed to let the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military slaughter against Iran, shall be willing to take the American army in Mexico against drug cardals.
The incidence of tortures against mutagent terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann's candidate.
It is far away from John McCain, the republic candidate in 2008, a au-political heavy weight.
The current Presidency contrahensions against, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all, won the Cold War.
They call in mind that also Obama was an amateur of self and had to give water into his wine, which was the subject of antiterror.
They are right to endorse the failure of his naive speech with Iran, the preliminary deduction of his "Jung" from Iraq, his imperfection in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of the weakness.
However, this opposition is not quite so impervable.
The population appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has disabled Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been guarding against military interventions that lead to a defense.
And Obama is more surprised by arguing that America must be rebuilded economically in order to raise his lead position to new life.
North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seaside of the East Sea and connects the Western Europe directly to Russia, has been operated.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to do this event with glories and glories.
Over 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, have lived last Tuesday at the East Sea coast under orchestra clause and with fine mecker buffet the instruction of the new gas pipe Nord Stream, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, the French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his office colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, have symbolicly turned the taxation of Ventil, which transports Russian gas into the western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters are intended to deliver additional Russian gases per year by a first pipeline of 1.224 km length connecting the region of Sankt Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to West Europe.
A second pipeline allowing a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of building a third line on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely and timely completion of this enormous construction work works like a win.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The NordStream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, under the avoidance of any trading course through third countries (Polen or Ukraine).
For this reason these two countries lose a little power: it will now be more difficult to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening the accession to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the strongest in the debate, was not returned to compare the Nord-Stream pipeline with a "new German-Social Pakt" in connection with the bond between Hitler and Stalin for the ocupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even higher security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this at the expense of a deterioration of European energy, as the project has hit a wide range between West and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has done it in few five years to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, the strong gas consumption and their gas stocks to squeeze.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new bacteria that connects us organically," confirmed François Fillon in the integration of the gas pipeline by pointing out in which degrees of gas contracts are also important from political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of the Gazprom manager represented in Lubmin as regards gas transmission.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater guide consists of steel with concrete mergers to protect it from ship fortresses.
She rests on the sea ground, in about 200 m depth.
In her construction, the Second World War had to be removed from mine fields.
"Et approximately hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed foreseeable," said Jens Müller, spokesman of the Nord Stream society.
Age and Flora had to be taken more strongly to protect Fauna and Flora.
The direction is a long metal serpent, difficult like 242 Eiffel tubes, which is broken over the whole length by nothing: neither through valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned before the coast of Sweden, but the project responsible have taken away from it, as Sweden had not been able to see a Russian national society on a permanent basis at the level of its coasts.
"In the case of a havaria, we close the gas in less than a minute," Jen's Müller justified.
So in the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline is in the air.
However, this case is regarded by the designers as only a little probable because the sweating was estimated at a resistance by a leak per 100.000 years.
The state control of the gas pipeline shall be ensured by both a subwater robot controlled by a sea ship for external surveillance, as well as by a device circulared within the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigarette, mixing a metre diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of the move through the direction at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device delivers precise information on possible deformations of the metal at its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without being subject to the least repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry-, 100 bar at the exit office.
Five companies have united their powers to achieve this project.
However, the direction remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF (ye to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gas union and the French group GDF Suez (ye to 9%).
These five companies have formed a company community called Nord Stream, which is commissioned with the construction and operation of gas pipelines.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland where tax is particularly cheap.
Gazprom has then rent the entire capacity of its gas transport, as a result of an extended twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how large the real transporters fall from gas volume," justified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was secured at 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should be 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For example, for GDF Suez, the investment figure was 240 million.
However, minority actionaries are sure to recover their statements, as Gazprom alone is carrying the liability risk.
The gas pipeline occurs at a sandy coastal strike covered with Kiev at Lubmin from the East Sea.
The 4,5 meters of high valves form the gas exit speeds.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other figures of the incoming gas before forwarding it into the German gas pipelines.
Last Tuesday, this terminal is delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per versatile hour.
In full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand note book.
From an Italian company about 15 years ago, Moleskine wants to give the letter new style.
It has a flair of adventures to spend hours with the writing at a candle.
The notebook of Moleskine is easy to recognise again, with its black, straightened inband, its rubber band, its own colored pages, as ageed over time.
The Moleskine note book, however, as we know today, has been created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo Modo, which has its seat in Milan, decided to bring a distant design notebook on the market at its time.
Maria Sebregondi, at that time the company's professional consultant, is commissioned with the launching of the new product.
The note book was inspired by an ancient production technology called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshaut), which refers to a cotton lack, which is used for example for polster trees.
This kind of notebook was very asked under writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has reappeared an old and almost forgotten object that has been an icon of avantgardist artist until the 20th century," explains Mary Sebregondi, now marking responsible for Modo Modo.
The success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rise by 26% and increase with a paragraph of 12,7 million pieces.
This is far away from the used production of the first years, where only 3,000 note books were designed.
Moleskine happens the Italian border and is carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantomenon of the buyers, since the notebook is excited to both businesses as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-sized customers.
Today, the small Italian company, which was in its beginning 12 employees, has over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company represents its notebooks in books, internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and understands its identity.
"We followed the spirit of time and his new need for writing, which exists despite e-mail growth," said Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand has launched an exposure called "Detour (tour)", in which architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a tape with Leoparden patterns at the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural contemporary and understood to diversify his products: bags, appointment calendar, filler, computer pillows... The brand shows the whole bandwidth of articles.
A success that brings younger to the plan: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the Investmentfond SG Capital Europe, today's syntegra Capital, and thus launched a new chapter in the history of Moleskine company.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at so high level?
About 19% of the disabled persons are looking for a job.
Today the "15. Week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a most conscious public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in disabled persons is always double as high as the average average value: 19% against 9% unemployment in the total population.
Demutating?
"No, so emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, which sets out the "week of work for disabled people."
"The progress made within fiveteen years is significant."
"Then the unemployment rate was not double, but three times so high."
"Non-destrotz remains extremely much to do."
However, it must be said that disabled unemployment continues to have many barriers before they get a job.
More often the older people are: 37% are older than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a low level of skills: 80% of them have no abitur and there are only 100,000 disabled persons among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of disabled persons are compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria which have a renewed increase in work and which are the "Cerne of the Problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a 1992 group that is helping companies to acquire disabled acquisitions.
So much to the sensitive brakes.
Keeps the unprecedented, the minds, which are certainly, but slowly progressing.
A study carried out in April by the Group of IMS for the Journal La Cité indicated that the managers have "a weak knowledge level of disabled persons" which is "overrepresented" by persons in Rollstühlen, psychically or intellectually minorized.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a far way forward to achieve the target of 6% disabled acquisitions, which was established in a 1987 law.
These final figures referred to in 2008 refer to a quota of 2.6%.
"We are now about 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization who is commissioned to carry out contributions from companies who disregard this law.
The evidence: The number "taxes paying" operational facilities has reduced as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, while from 59,000 to 46.000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which provides contribution increases, created strong pressure on the companies, explained Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses real knowledge in particular with the large company groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the business facilities between 20 and 49 employees have disabilities and companies with 100 to 199 employees, on the other hand, are 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Eden Hazard and George's Leeks have not hesitated their pleasures that brought them the friendship game.
It would be too far to claim that there has been a secret understanding between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
On the side of the town of France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to close peace and enjoy peace.
Five months after the temperamental spirit of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had no praise for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assures the poor Liller on the other hand.
What the contrast between its representation in club and national empire is"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille, I'm over the whole year what's not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, led Friday evening against Romania with regard to the Match against France to finally shine."
However, without leaving the note of the pleasure.
The French national team has been fireing since the age of 7, his vigorous field trains he led between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This is essentially helping to increase the "enzymous" character of this meeting.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there", he remarks.
"We just walked over the way."
"Don't give them to play means great luck!"
Clearly read with lowliness "Stolz".
"The pride to carry out a galamatch".
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his property as "obvious" - that France" has become a team at very high level" and that's little more than a year after the dreama of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done damn good work," he said excited.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European Championship, the technician looks very well to share the plane with the Blue (the French National Elf) ... and the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We're a little Belgier coming out groovy," he stressed.
"We are planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"They'll notice that in the upcoming games." The game against France involves.
Portugal very confidential
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento sees the return against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
When playing, both teams had missed the sensitivity.
"In the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his National Elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship 2012.
For Portugal this means, indeed, only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play and serve an opponent, including Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears that the cubes have not yet been pleased.
Portugal dominated over more than an hour clear the party, but the team was not able to press the thing down the so important steal that had taken the pressure from her.
"This is a good result, but that is a certain risk because we have not reached outward gate."
Home, however, in her bright radiating city de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to perceive themselves in front of a audience that should be equally heated to the game, even if the party was naturally announced as "herely", the optimistic but clear bento said.
"We expect a very small match, but we are perfectly convinced to win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50% chance to be with the European Championship in 2012," however, relatively the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The distinction on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a gate.
A distinction can already be enough for the Bosnians who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but that is a certain risk because we have not reached outward gate," regrets Bento.
"We will enter against a team having high technical quality and have players with many individual quality," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would have preferred to exercise maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "not give time to think about."
A good idea, under the prerequisite that it is actually implemented this time.
