DFB-Chef Grindel does not see a basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel does not see a basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team at present.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on one time that one comes to talk to him also about why he found this one or others as it was laid down in his state," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "image timeling.
Despite the monthly debate on the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan, he regreted the return of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would liked if Mesut Özil would continue to play for Germany.
I also went out until a certain time of it that would be like this," said Grindel.
The 29-year-olds had explained his return from the DFB team in July and also reasoned that Grindel had not defended him against racist oppositions during the WM.
The DFB-Chef repeated his criticism of Özil that it was not ready for a conversation with German trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build pressure, but he knows it from the soccer so that if "a man leaves a team or turns an association to talk about it with his trainer and I find it damaged that this conversation has not yet been reached".

But he may be significant because the owner had many collector pieces in his garden cabinet.

In December 2017, Audi-Chef Rupert Stadler announced that the task force was soon dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/drive combinations were expected to be tested," he said at that time.

We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.

On Friday, the VW Supervisory Council had a decision on Stadler's future and wished to continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities are proposing the Audi-Chef to have authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after the notification of gas fraudes.
He knew of the manipulations or ignored them consciously.

Because of the transformation to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP there are production extracts at Audi, Scots said "Heilbronn voice".
In general, he sees a meaningful demand for limousines such as the Audi Models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.

Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and Özil-Affäre in the coming year, wants to be able to be a DFB prize.
"I do my work and try to do it as good as it goes," said Grindel as a guest on the early Sunday morning in the "current sports studio" of the ZDF.

According to Grindel, the future EM-Chef Organizer Philipp Lahm should cooperate in the DFB presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that in this role he is also advised in the presidium in the future and then, of course, warmly invited to make his experience available in sports questions," said Grindel.
In speculations whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB-Chef, he did not want to participate in him.
As a consequence from the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan, with the Turkish President of the State Rep Tayip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that a national player should be a non-migration background integration message of the DFB in future.
At present, this office of Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Kamerun.
"If there is a clear impact on society and soccer without migration, and says that "the topic is important, there we need to take care of", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations where integration must work," said Grindel.

Erdořan opens mosque in Cologne
The Turkish President, Recep Tayip Erdořan, officially opened thisib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
He had previously met his three-day state visit, among other things, with Kanzler Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Critical to Germany

"Agive you wherever you can only be able," said Mendes at the festival at the night to Sunday about 60.0000 viewers.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Also actresses like Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations show themselves on the stage at the most hourly stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a terrible certificate when many viewers held the sound of a surrounding metal locking for shots, got anxiety and tried to flee.
Shortly, panics developed, people ran through each other.
Seven viewers were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
But the New York Police and the musician Chris Martin then retired people from the stage.
"Nobody is trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all in security.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" Group were available for free every year on the Internet.
Those who wanted to prosper on the Internet had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actresses there were Jubel and Applaus, however, calls for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although this talked together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons at the stage for more equality of men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had expressed himself in the Judge Committee of the US Senate for the Nomination of Board Kavanaugh as Judge at the Supreme Court and thus forced many women to the head.
At least three women have raised abuse presumpts up to attempting rape against Kavanaugh, which rejects it.
Flake called for a FBI investigation of the prerequisites, after two women, who have experienced their own information as a result of sexual violations, faced him in a lift to the Committee's meeting.
"You may also like to come together at any time in a lift," Flake said now at the New York concert.
Press freedom: Federal government defends jurisdiction of the journalist
Government speaker Steffen Seibert has defended a journalist from the press conference by Kanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) and the Turkish President-in-Office Tayip Erdo.
In Hamburg, the Turkish journalist had taken over a T-shirt with the Turkish and German record of "Freedom for Journalists" and went to the first series.
The T-Shirt, if not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
The press conference was disrupted.
The journalist's action would create a strong disruption, which is not acceptable.
He made it possible for personnel to bring out the man.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Bundeskanzleramt.
This applies totally independent of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in the prison in Turkey.
Many of them are suspicious spionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the fethullah wave movement.
Turkish leadership is responsible for the failure of punch testing on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not sure before the Turkish authorities: first at the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had provided for oversight.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey they still run processes against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz fully drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-looking, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at this twice: Yes, that's actually Florian David Fitz.
The popular actress was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for feucht-fresh conversations at the Theke of the Hamburg Harbour Kneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller sticks with her guests on some beer, some wine, or even more highly percentage drinks to lock up the mood and tongues.
Not a few promises also drink courage for the compulsory singing situations.
On Friday a further result of the popular Talkshow was recorded.
This time, Florian David Fitz was known by films such as "Männerherzen", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Hardest Day".
But the farmer did not get good to the high north.
On Saturday he posted a self - his face is completely broken on it, the eyes only two little snails.
The bed seal shows a completely excited Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he just has a powerful cat.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - findings that he now won: "Regel one: doesn't go to Ina night.
Rule two: Never drink the black acid.
And spray.
And the round of eggs, the Ina slides around half three, leaves away too.
The alcohol consumption is truly written to the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to combat the navys.
They ranged from instantbrows, fishbreads or - probably the most targeting - headache tablets.
Others just amazed over the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
As Ina Müller has survived the nightly suspension, it is not yet known.
Since she moderates the TV thing at the Theke since 2007, 53 years old seem to be clearly tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with fandalism and unrat
The entry into the 36 km long railway route in the Red Käppchenland in Treysa is hard to find and mould.
Recipes against grassing fandalism are searched, but solutions hardly depict themselves.
Shrews, cigarettes, waste and unrat, demolized trash and now decorated indication painting - so since long-term the entry with the seating group to the wheelway on the Haaße-Hügel in Treysa.
For the prestigious object railway in the Red Cakeland, a more than unreachable view.
However, the subject deals with members of the ADFC-local group of Schwalmstadt and others, says the cycling officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Council on bicycle traffic.
There is no solution until now.
The proposals submitted from the seat group to the regular deletion of the waste trucks and the cleaning of the areas at the entrance point.
"I think the latter would be the hour's command - independent of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the issue should also be introduced into the local Council.
Not only the waste drives bicycle riders and residents around - the seat group is to celebrate regularly on weekends.
It is not only often hard, the laughs are also destroyed: pistols out of the earth cracked, demolized the trash, painting crochets, seating furniture are embarrassed.
Volunteers have already come up more frequently, tell ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions were only the speaking drops on the hot stone.
They are worried that the rass on the bike road is Treysa Treff point for suspension.
"According to the entire route, the Haaße-Hügel lies clearly the focus," confirms the cyclist officer, which now also provides for the new wheeling site in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it becomes right expensive."
Another idea would be a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this may make the threshold significantly higher to understand common goods.
But that would presume that a police strip will then be over.
In general, Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Haaße-Hügel.
He must be designed more attractive.
With the frequency of the route, one could be very satisfied.
Tourist marketing is still constructive.
Our route is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," said ADFC members.
As an extremely critical risk point, ADFC member Susanne Klipper estimates the situation in the Ashrod Road in Treysa.
There's no obsesses on the haaße pillow.
In the case of regular transport, bicycle drivers may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of transport," they explain.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music competition in the Cultural Railway Station: The "Kö van Hiltrup" and the Sea
The first call for the music competition was a success, creative and in each other.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup" is the appell of the city's open-off Hiltrup, in the "music competition for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eyeswinners in the sympathic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formed.
In fact, it was soon a family fellow with coffee and cakes from the honourable officials of the Cultural Railway Station.
Seven formations arrived from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long albanic dance in Hiltrup, the Neun of the "Hiltruper Star Colors", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the children's garden Lummerland, and finally Rike Weßling and the Blackies.
This contest, said district citizen Joachim Schmidt, was a new one.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What did the scriptures see connected?
In the places, the Hiltrupe lake and the market all were particularly frequently mentioning.
Rolf Ihmig shorted the Allee in his slandery song to the "Kö van Hiltrup".
The Cultural Railway Station was also worthy of it.
The experience of each other took place in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the artists or indications about her sheep.
So you learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
By the tone engineer Stefan Schemmelmann knew Franke that the youngest in Ludwigshafen came up - with Barclay James Harvest in the program at a great event.
And Alvin Jasic has placed on Youtube, however.
"It's not about profit," said Franke.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltrup gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury’s favorites - so that others can hear their songs too.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechnical Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihemig with his Hiltrup shamp, the Frank particularly impressed with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two teachers of guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölles.
Like all, the children came up again to the finale, even without electronic support, "just well," said Franke.
The jury was made by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, inexperience of melody and re-evaluation value.
Gisbert Keller belonged to the Westfälischen School of Music, Andreas Klomfast of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Economic Association and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the City Partoffensive.
The office of the city had put the event into life from the occasion of its ten - year - old existence.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
All were "before satisfaction", and "the atmosphere was good" in soon very full cultural train station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that stand against each other.
For each page there is a view screen, in which four cards with keywords that can only be discarded by the old trick with the red slide.
So ensure that the opponent can also read nothing out of appearance.
For example, on the cards is able to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3rd cube.
4th festival.
These are the concepts that it will be fortaneously encrypted.
For this is not to be advised, but codes.
Alternately a player per team is the cipher.
It gets a code card, which may be "3.4.2".
It should be recommended in "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he is supposed to, in this order and in this example, to describe the terms "curve", "Fest", and "Window" - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opponent team is not possible; for this wins the party, if it's twice able to contact the code.
So the cryptor notes and reads loudly before: "Where" for the cubicles, "Lose" as an contrast to festival; here, of course, there would be something like "party" and "power" because he was addressed in school and knowing the window tower there.
This is the round for rounds, team for team continues.
Although you don't know the terms of the opposite, they can be better together with any indication that the cryptor is there.
It should be mysterious, but not turned down, so the rescriptions should be, otherwise it is unnecessary to his team.
The most cryptical to "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule penalty.
The competitors probably have to study it very long and detailed until they can finally play.
The statement video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But the one who has first disposed will be fascinated how much feeling is in this seemingly unstable game.
In total, however, "Decrypto" is not as closure as predecessors and Genre prim "Codenames", which also an agent theme is based on a game of less words, but much better to play in small groups.
And whoever it is about advice and not about victory points, it can also easily find one version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police greeting and harms guests in the knee
A 48-year-old man worked the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday on Sunday double.
He first showed Hitler's greeting in the upper city of a passing police strip, and later he also found up in the upper city in a knee when he complained other guests.
After he did not come after the police's place reference, he had to spend the night at the Police Inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In the poorer state, it must be responsible for the use of marks of constitutional organisations.
Operation Pressig was home to the shoe blocks
The railway plant in Pressig was decades in the Frankenwald.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffer knalled, one heard it all pressy," Georg Denkel remembers the history of the place and the station.
Nobody's right.
Then the brakes also snatched and knattered the cargons.
That was pure railway.
Exhibitions that are inspired for Denkels Home Pressy.
Neither in the Francenwald was a place so characterized by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steil catastrophe to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 meters, has its dialpoint in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to manage this, train and shoe blocks needed in pressig had their home.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway plant with 21 lounge shoes, educational workplace, cycling and railway mastery.
"Heart was the film that had a diameter of 18 meters after a transformation in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, Bahnhistorictor and 47 years of career.
The station (BW) Pressig, which was signed in 1968 Bamberg, also operated Loks for the sides Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehersten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - North Halves.
On July 15, 1950, the "Folksblatt" reported a personnel of 160 men; 13 steams and eight Elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
Elektrification of the route 1939 already minimized the need for train and shoe blocks.
From 1977 onwards they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 weighs were ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the operating work were canceled, 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not taken a better use of the location, also in puncto freight transport, in the eye".
At Pentecost 1989, the railway directorion Nürnberg featured a 50-year-old electricization of Nürnberg - Saalfeld a pumpy station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10 000 excited viewers here," Georg Dinkel remembers.
Well, it's a little bit later.
On June 1st, 1991 the last 30 men were pulled off, Pressig was history.
"The ranter and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," Denkel remembers.
Every mistake would have had fatal consequences.

50 years MGV 68 Albanians: singer celebration 50th birthday festival
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albanians at that time also made their unmuted air.
At least five of them.
They did not want part-out to find out that after the resolution of the Church Chair "Cäcilia" there should be no longer a sang life in the city part.
In the meantime, it has become legend: at a bank in the Tinnbosch they drove the MGV 68 Albanians from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "house of encounter".
"It becomes full of today," without president Jürgen Holstieg, and he should maintain justice.
150 guests were a real success for the Albanian singers.
They had left the foundation festival back to the jubilee.
For years it was tradition, then there was only a break.
The festival of tradition was the point of the 50-year-old existence.
A elegant ball was asked for solid clothing before.
The guests did not sit in seats like in the "Haus der Begegnung" in seating series, but cozy at tables.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Traumschiff" Heide Keller became the star.
Now she speaks openly that the series could have had a fellow guilt on her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018, she went from board forever.
The series that she had become a star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsod (1929 – 2013) with which she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason too.
Because I was grown up with this work, traveling with a bag alone around the world and many of me admired colleagues took me true at a glance," says Keller in conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
Firstly, she was always "the woman of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "Traumschiff".
For now, the journalists only called for Heide Keller.
"Of him like this, I don't know."
She thinks it may have been possible that her husband could have been quite negligent, but "How many men also created conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried for Hans von Borsody "the only thing to be right and he wanted to know my fears, not know my weaknesses.
That means good German: I have dealt with," as she further explains.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I was never in truth even if I was at stage sometimes frey and courageous.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Hartner, Keller said yes, "if I feared that it could even be a second time."
On the day before the standing official tranquillity I sat in the garderobe and wanted to say everything.
Marriage also failed from Borsody.
Why didn't you ever hit it with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller's love at that time, "speaked in film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've got a lot too naive to love."
The NZZ-Ressort of Zurich's night life in the city has been waiting for this time to the ZFF opening party.
Our falter is not a motto, but a little light shooting.
And the grey gloss in which a green carpet is boiled on the six-seven-seven-site-seat-seat-seated it by fee.
But it's holding film festival, there's more or less famous in the light light.
So, on this late Thursday evening, he wrecks over the place to make a short ease in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
Thus, the public toilet plant sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates their premiums at the festival: the emergency event in the participants of a new paviloon gives itself a lot of effort to flow a luxurious ambience.
However, this evening it stinks in the Lord Oasis for any reasons to heaven.
So out here, on the other side of the street: invited guests who have been stayed at the "Green Book" cinema next to the opening film, celebrate the festival with a party in the three-stage goods house every year.
This name fits perfectly to this film festival: The entire earthball is known to be the works shown .
What you don't have to do with an article about this festival, so that you can't get into a clever application for its 190 partner companies.
The feather binds around the feathers, which have put him a good fee and two bully door steers actually win him in a generous way.
In the middle, the invited forces to dance far after midnight to live music or to prefer to be presented by DJ Rhythms to whom they cry up to each other, and dish with Cüpli exquisite hemps down.
In the delicate dinner shop in the souterrain, Austern waits for sleeved walls, besides the incomparable raw shrinks Culaello di Zibello is freshly cut up a chocolate brown sprout.
And the hammer is: All the sales regimes of full exclusive products have not been issued for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without large losses.
You must love this country for it!
The Falter studies the sign at the Rolltreppe: "Track a long dress, please caution on the Rolltreppe."
If these are two separate instructions, he has been in the Dress code.
But it's rather a condicial construction, and it's certainly already saved life.
A cocktail called "Golden Eye", is suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not forced by this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been compressing the brand for years, isn't here the evening either.
But because, between local prominence, cash table and kitchen items, a face passing before the observer is known: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
It may not be far from his main author.
And really: Similarly, Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost as a chorknabe acting by the amount.
He's not questioned, not ventilated, one sculptured upstairs.
Just for this retirement, like to misunderstand as cleverness, international stars love this film festival.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as a ruler until 2021
After the crossing of the last weeks, the GroKo boxes several survey disciplines.
The SPD falls in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has first overridden the SPD in the Emnid sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases a counter to 17 percent, which SPD deals with a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the most deep value for the Union in Sunday trend.
Greens reach 15 percent, the links 11 and the FDP 10 percent.

Who says that in times of tinder there is no romantic renowned stories more – it should be talked about Putenfleisch at Aldi times.
Munich - In times of digital "Fastfood-Dating" by tinder and Co., the supermarket represents almost an anachronistic romantic location for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced puddle meat, boxer short snippets on the wool table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere sweap to the right.
The App Tinders is in a call to be less a contact, but rather a sleeved stock exchange.
We have waited for the test: How do women react, in the first message, not long around the hot breeze?

Thus, it is the author of this annonce in an unknown aldi-firal that she will also find her dreamer, with which she was just talking about the "30 percent reduced bio-putmeat".
She deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood in any case for the faith in the magic of the analog learning.

20 minutes still, that should be fucking long.
And then that: VfL chapitän Florian Quabeck flog the leather in the criminal room in the 80th minute.
Schiedsrichter Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately showed the point.
Jannis Schneider couldn't escape the gift (79.).
Bange Minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase before she had the Sieger in the 87th minute of twelve meters.
Maybe too much of the good would have been.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

In this way, only 8 percent of the boards for the Foundation 1 September were female, as revealed by the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and preferred the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to set themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors pass by them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.

In the 30 dax companies - in recent years of pre-reacher - the women's share stagnated.
Recently 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will re-recover consistent women in the next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
One-five RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they should not continue to engage in self-compliance to increase the proportion of up to "null percent".
Another picture is available in the Supervisory Advisory Boards: On 1 September the female share was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men more than one year ago.
"In 2023 there were as many women as a percentage of 40 percent each year", says the report.

The police are determined in close consultation with the Bonn State prosecutor who is carrying the debt of the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we uncomfortable
After the blameable out in the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Unlike West Ham United, ManU 1:3. The way of defeat may still be speaking.
The scene was in the 74th minute, where the rehearse Marko Arnautovic for West Ham was the 3:1 shot; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had eventually led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at the Pass of Mark Nobel, all the resistors of Manchester stood, and read Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball on the helpless David de Gea.
It was this the negative highlight of a far-reaching performance before.
On the other hand, the cozy situation at Uniteds City Rivale Manchester City is currently different.
The Citizens trained by Mourinhos great competitors Pep Guardiola came to a approximately decades 2:0-Sieg against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the Heim Team first broke out of the officer.
Sergio Agüero provided for a good hour and a double pass with the former gate protection for the security of the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jumping to the table tip.
Liverpool No longer Table Leader
Three days after the 1:2 low position in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fighted a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As at the Cup-out, Belgier Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoner.
The meeting of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained in the final phase of the only match of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Improved Daniel Sturridge made it in the 89th minute with his screw.
So after the Reds started into the week with a makeless balance, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
Firstly, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the remis in the Liga, the Blues Liverpool also crashed from the top of the table.
As City also celebrated the two London City Clubs Todtenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (over Watford) 2:0-Siege.
However, the fans of the gunners, with which Granit Xhaka played, had to wait against the surprise team from the Hertfordshire County, until the 81th minute of success.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart made an instruction of Alex Iwobi unfortunately into its own gate, only two minutes later Mesut Özil provided the decision with his third season driver.
Arsenal passed through the fifth victory to Watford and lies newly behind the Great Rivalen Todtenham on Rang 5. A strong impression continues to leave uprising Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unattended at 2:0 against Southampton in the Liga for the fifth time and laid the 8th place.
VW-Kernmark is missing: Pariser Automobilsalon in the sign of Diesel Debatte
The Paris automobile salon takes place every two years between the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet all-foremost: The Dieselskandal and the rings for driving prohibitions and suspensions should not leave German car companies even at the Paris Branch Meeting.
At the automobile salon 2018, they show their news from the next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The Diesel does not really play a major role.
However, the possible exchange and retirement contracts for Diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the Government in Berlin, should be an important issue at least behind the shining clauses of the fairs.
A great name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW core brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there, among others, their first pure electrical models: The e-tron of the Indian cities is supposed to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart's 2019.
Both of them were presented officially.
The iNext by BMW is supposed to start only 2021.
The new three are focused on Paris.
Over 250 exhibitors are represented in this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobile services and software providers are also present in each of their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, will take place every two years between the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in the heavy earthquakes and the following Tsunami.
Thousands are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injuries.
The island was shot by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first beben had the strength 5.9, the second had the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport are damaged, enormous damage has occurred.
After the legs the Tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds of the beach had gathered to a festival.
It is anxious that the number of victims is still significantly high.
The figures are only Palu.
However, there are also many other municipalities - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
About 150 Bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne, with a helper team, celebrated the final gotten service for motorcycle drivers in the peace church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The place before the peace church in Eveking was the motorcycle drivers on Sunday.
After all, the final goddess was on the program for the bikers.
Frank Schröder is the motor passenger within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and thus responsible for the Seelsorgerian concerns of the two-wheel wheel drivers.
Between April and September will always take place on the last Sunday of a month of traditional motorcycle-gotten service (MoGo) at the House Nordhelle.

There were some 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to deal with anything other than regular worship.
At 10 p.m. the Boliden were raised before the entrance portal of the church.
First of all, the biker frequencies were on the program and it was allowed to be reinforced with coffee and cake or even with a delightful curry worst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group of Gumersbach, were also involved.
The preaching held during the Biker God’s Service Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer-Songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical sub-maling.
"Though the bikers prefer the Blues-Rock, Valerie Lill attacks more poetic-ruhy sounds," said pastor Frank Schröder.
This was also a novum in the history of the motorgod service last night.
Flightor Home Association celebrates large festival: After the apple the milk comes
And also during the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apples.
Great interest also raised Georg Hartmann-Niemerg.
He had his apple press in the luggage and demonstrated his stunning viewers stepping up the process from the mature apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Nemmerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the great chauffle.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely broken mass.
Many of the children could still not imagine how to become a tasteful drink.
But they could also look at this late Friday afternoon.
In shapes packed and surrounded by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the a little like hackselgut-looking apples layer for layer over each other.
Thanks to certain technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice went on and down into a large vessel.
But the fertilizer Landwirt had already completed specialities.
So he opened his "Schatzkiste" and presented the elderly visitors to the latest federal whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly large.
In cozy atmosphere, the parents came to talk, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing but also discovered the built-up hipburg for themselves.
Also actively, the Fuchtor Cameradship of former soldiers engaged in the feuchtor's festival and invited to short-term games at some stations.
In the coming year the home association will also offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, will not be the home house in the heart of the Spargeldorf of the place of events.
A farm will be visited instead.
This will also be due to the issue: finally it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season plead: "Bishe situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga-Nedderlage, Trainer André Breitenreiter collected his disappointed professor of Hannover 96 and spoke courageous to them.
Viel Positives had not been seen at 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at the inquiry of Frankfurt.
"It's a terrible situation, but you must come out as a team," said 96-football profi Pirmin Schwegler and shake: "This is naturally disappointing because you're always taking a lot."
The further defeatless Niedersachsen, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) was connected, stands down with two counters and are a degrading candidate in its current constitution.
On the other hand, the first season home was celebrated by the magnificent Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) reached the gates for the DFB pocalyptians who preferred after the successful general sample for the Lazio-League game with seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's Vize World Championship Rebic was involved in his initial defence in almost any dangerous open act of the Hessen and never got into control by Hannover's defense.
After the WM long hit storms, with his tempo and adherence, he showed why he is so valuable for the insight.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, which was granted by the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the Frankfurter's initial formation.
An infected headball of Lucas Torró (17.).
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped at the last moment by the 96-defense of the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer.
The leadership for the masters of the house was almost inevitable and totally deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a denied corner into the prison room, haller extended by the head before the gate, where Ndicka only needed to keep the foot.
It was the first Bundesligatre for the refusal player who came from the French twotligist AJ Auxerre in summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time, Haller fitted to his storm partner Rebic, who had no chance to get through and 96-torwart Michael Esser.
In half time, Hannover-Coach responded to the weak idea of his Elf and brought two new open forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxony played a bit more courageously forward, the infinite ideas remained out to a short time before the end of the time of the connection.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a few hours, Rebic started a solo and then placed cross on De Guzmán, who had to move the ball to the empty gate.
The rest was only shooting for the Frankfurters, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz will be the party milestone
Würsels Despite cool temperatures, good mood occurred at October festival in the city of town.
The Munich Superburger Chair Dieter Reiter created it million public at the opening of 185.

Facing: Facing Christians celebrating Holy-Kreuz-Fest
The Fine Catholics celebrate the Holy Creuz festival on September 14, or on Sunday afterwards.
The festival service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Church with the closing segen.
The Church of Holy Crusa, the Church of Holys, houses the firm Christ, who came from the 30-year-old war, and should have shot on the legend after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flashed out of the shot wound.
It developed a great walling to the shooting Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar is standing, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching work, pastor Adolf Buhl reminds that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the significance of the crying parish, the service was bad.
After the service, the procession took place to the Holy Church and ended with the conclusion of the Church of the Cross Festival.
For many years, the Catholic Church Chor has then invited the worldly part of the Festival to the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided visitors with gorgeous foods and a large selection of cakes and weather, farms.
In the afternoon, the parish community also offered leaders around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid Segers informed the visitors about the damages to fassade, roof, sand stoneworks and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will be taken up until the next year.
After the taste has been a few time, damages could be detected more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared concretely.
Surely it is that renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damages already existed for some years have become larger, but it has also been found more, which was only possible by means of scrutiny.
The sockel utilisation works are complete, before winter, will continue to be started with natural stones and you hope to be able to conclude half of these works this year.
Instruction: New residence home in the New Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Danube aid Illar opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münster view street.
The fact that the Municipal View Street is now given "a very special house" of its determination - there were all the attendants agreed at the date of arrival.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who are already living in the living home of Danube-yller have been pointed out to the special architecture of the new construction.
Wider singing, flush and doors, larger spaces and accessible access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former officer building of the U.S. Army was put on the test stand for the residents with mobilecap: "The house came into the years and no longer time in the equipment," said Bader retrospectively.
In 2016, the Baggers moved to retreat the house.
The new construction should be designed as friendly and bright as possible in order to make the inhabitants feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Life aid Danube Iller opens new home
Approximately 4,6 million euros invested life aid in new construction.
The voluntary State added EUR 2.4 million, the region of Schwaben EUR 450000.
The construction works have remained in the planned framework, according to architect Bader, as well as financially.
He also thanked the director of life aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The team between accessible and simultaneous fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many standards that allowed the residents to experience freedom to be able to move without foreign assistance.
Similarly, the head of the Social Management District of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house focuses on the special needs of his residents who need aid to be mobile.”
The living and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And continue, "The property in this situation is a real case of happiness because it is no longer to acquire in today's situation".
Overall, the new residential home in Municipal View Street offers almost 1500 square meters place for 30 people with disabilities that are divided into three living groups.
The pride of life aid leader Heinz is the 11 full-time forces, which were all appointed by tariff.
Germany: Sweetly complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the Deputy SPD-Bundesvorsitzender Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all countrymen not to find themselves with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unit.
With these differences, we should not be satisfied," said Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Minister President said the "day level on Sunday".
The objective must remain to create the same conditions for life throughout the country.
It is inadequate that East Germans worked longer than people in West Germany, but 15 percent less content.
"I can explain nobody about 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this folly dog end the Korea conflict?
The one year of Pungan-Jagdhund is intended to shake the wounds between the two Koreans.
In pursuing a relaxation of relations with Seoul, Pjöngjang gave the South Korean president Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungan Jagdhunde.
According to Moons office on Sunday, the two had already reached their recipients about one year old on Thursday.
They then occurred the Panmunjom border site together with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the animals 'anticipation'.
The dogs with the thick white fell, top ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced to the north in Pjöngjang at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and the North Korean power maker Kim Jong Un in mid-September.
Both countries agreed to join international sports law fights such as the 2020 Olympics and jointly apply to the release of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also authorized to close the tonage test plant Ri for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What's Austria?
For the 100th year of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this Memorial year since now nearly ten months, many new books have been published, which usually answer this question back to the past hundred years.
Of course, Wolfgang Maderthaner, Historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archive, cited in the fine "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New Week, New Chance for the Government
Back to business - so is the inofficial motto for today's beginning working week of the Great Coalition.
A Interview, hardly a talk, where the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and CSU have not recently deprived the "return to work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cassians and otherly employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but it's it.
If the Federal Government is now far from remedying her order - the rule - it should not now be kept with conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and SPD can actually bring something together according to the provocations and flames of the last few weeks, possibly already show Monday.
In the evening, the tops of the government parties come together to the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to regularly call this round to deteriorate conflicts early; a teaching from all the dispute.
Firstly, however, with the Diesel re-establishment and the Power Immigration Act, there are conflicting topics on the agenda.
CSU Minister for Transport Scheuer wants to leave the car companies with exchange premiums glimp off, SPD and CDU see producers in the obligation to comply with technical discharge of older diesel.
During the weekend, the Union and the SPD are far apart from the planned professional immigration law.
The SPD calls for a permanent perspective for refused asylum seekers who work or training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "spur exchange" from the asylum system on the labour market.
So again there will be dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equally, the GroKo has joined together, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
Thought is good.
Without dispute, a society drawn up by so many, sometimes contradictive interests does not come forward.
However, in order to be constructive, dispute must not be built again for party-tactical reasons on the matter of His or Nots.
It's still about politics, not about theatre.
Union and SPD should contradict - but always have the effectiveness of human beings in view.
What is helpful and it uses many?
With this key question, both the Diesel and the trace change questions can be clarified beautifully - and thus gain confidence.
This is the most important thing that the People's Party has to fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister of Fisheries
Does the Minister of Labour Sustainables Sustainable to the Staff Regulations?
Daniela Holzinger wants to see it more precisely.
"Actual day and night" had worked their legislatures at the social insurance reform, reported an overwhelming social minister at the presentation of two weeks ago.
In the list-Pilz-Mandaterin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprising - it now brings the matter into Parliament by request.
She is going out of it, "that the minister only expressed her enthusiasm about the use of her team and did not want to proclaim any infringements of the service law of the current cameras."
Yet, she now has questions to be able to freely speak Har tinger from every suspicion.
Police travels a street on the search for women's lakes
Marxgrün - Lange did not want the police to express it.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is grabed.
The route is still locked in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
The medians had previously used an archaeology hund.
The special dog trained for the smell of old human chests, along with his leader in multiple use, was finally able to limit the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, together with scientists of the Technical University of Munich and the upper Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the field of the labeled street.
For more than one year, state lawyership and criminal police court have been working the crime.
More and again, Marxgrün was locked a bicycle path and studied with sunshine devices, as the mediators suspected that here could have been deteriorated during the reconstruction of the state street 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: crawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia year
On Monday, the controversial independent referendum in Catalonia is the first time.
But it's about crawalls before.
The separateists have not forgotten the police from the autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there has been conflicts between the police and the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independent leaders, among other things, with color powders when they wanted to prevent them from demonstrating the national police and civilian garment.
Some 3000 officials of the police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who had been in use last year in the elections as an illegal referendum.
In trying to prevent citizens from voting, it was also violence at that time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separateists and the central state security forces apart, reported Spanish media.
But some of the about 6000 separateists would then have tried to break through the police chain with violence, and the officials, among others, were thrown up with colors and eggs.
Six persons were arrested that 24 others were easily injured, under appeal to the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision on the depression of the rich region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had been subject to forced management in the autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into the exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also turned down abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the regional government and other activists of the separatist movement are still in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After May the new Catalan Government's official accession, forced management was completed.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra consists of the "right of self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected Ratelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate themselves torless
Red-wich ails continue on the spot.
Also at the FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0 difference.
The concluding light and the third-party, they were dispatched of 438 viewers in the Heidewald Stadion as a coincidence.
The first half was overlookable by the conversation factor Arg.
As a result, who would like to get a beer or a brute worst could do this without worrying.
It wasn't the danger of missing a torchance because there was virtually no one.
First shot after half an hour
Responsible for the first (free) gate of the whole party of goods marked Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle also only real - option had the Ahleners, as Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling, forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the criminal space limit.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was in a early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged injuries, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing long-term.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Müttel aimed at just about the housing of 18 meters, and after an hour the goods lodgers were openly in appearance.
After a ball acquisition of Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The rapidly conducted conter on Sinan Aygün "Crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a but low shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also posted with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) after an ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein cornerball.
RWA interimtrainer Angelo Daut responded, first led Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Müttel (70.).
It's done - nothing.
More than optical suspicion thanks to its own initiative, the Ahleners did not stand.
Only in the 91th minute, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but also that didn't take anything.
Angelo Daut tried to find out the positive: "It likes us to have played zero," but unfortunately, the zero also got forward.
"We weren't this time as tortured as still against wooden developments and that although our opponent had no pleasure to play here," stated RW Ahlen's interimtrainers.
Apparently, "laid all such a little" against a team, "who just wanted to defend.
I didn't feel that we could get an opponent," says Daut.
However, as a observer, he did not feel as if his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too daring for that.
Rekenfelder harvest thanks market: Fortunately there are enough creators
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and every franchler of the Reckenfelder Table-out site for which these donations are determined.
The officials assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld too".
At the opening, the sky rayed blue, on the other hand the place was still empty, but that should still change during the day.
Because, "This is so beautiful, so we are here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the Festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a nice prize Humor.
For the couple of Brockmann, which should actually be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumpen short-term.
The Verena (Tochter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there are enough creators.
And the "creation" did not take it between musically entertaining the increasing visitors.
It was so good that some people were told at the later hour.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer was pleased.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to submit the opening date of this time in his appointment plan.
He rejoices about the many actives with their towns, including mainly associations.
"Actually, there should not be something like a table," he still thanked for the action of the manchur.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those in the towns and also included the further festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful stroke - what's going on here.
Then the Maikranz was taken away by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of fire and brought to the winterquarters.
In many places, for the physical well-being was worked.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative in his decoupier ages.
Furnier works, beer covers with refect fields motifs and some more he had in the offer.
A speciality offered three Ruckfelder Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth Busschüler.
The latter has another speciality.
Honey cakes in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Then the little Elsa had to take up again, so well tasteed the cake.
The sexy is that the visitors then left long to the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn feast.
Schmiererys with local political message: No successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknown has barely funded way to build a skate plant.
On a number of points there are colonies corresponding, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
At least one case, the police have been punished for damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich" were used in paintings, among other things at the Gempt-Maliki and at the Old Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the professional election fair on 19 September, a corresponding letter on the advertising shield was discovered at the stairs to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message of that time seemed to have been left only with a Edding, it could be easily removed.
"Only days later, it was then again, this time stood up," says Rottmann.
It assumes that the appropriate advertising mark must be replaced.
A special note is given by the name of several large firms from Lengerich on the table.
If the skate plant is built, its realization should also be possible by sponsors.
Jörg Hesselmann explains no name to be named from the urban field of school, sport and culture.
But well possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the damaged table.
For years local policy and administration have been involved in the topic of skate plants.
After the old one was built on the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
The Council finally spoke morely for the firekeeping park.
However, this sense has not been converted - too many factors seemed to have been speaking against construction in this place.
At the end of June, a turnover followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee have now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says to the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then has the Council of City.
He is going out of a decision this year, which could be built at a positive vote in 2019.
Enpassing in air insurance is even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic cassette in summer, the German airlots do not see any signs for improving the next year.
"In this year we had Wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said the head of the trade union of air insurance, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and failures of flights is the long-known staff note in the European air carriers for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can reach fast improvements for the next year, but training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade union.
Europe-wide, the market for finished lotsen was empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, to monitor the upper German airspace, some hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized that several air traffic trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hansestadt, on Friday representatives of the Federal Republic, countries, air insurance, airlines and airports gather to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work poisoning and overtime, that will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the German air insurance.
Maas re-established the EU Commission's provisions for the Lotsen-Misere.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running up to 2019 were far too low.
The costs and personal savings of the national air carriers are now fully covered by the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Deputy Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to apply to regulations in Brussels that are not yet delaying air carriers.
At present, EU regulations would be agreed until 2024 and there were further deterrents to be scared.
The EU is constantly exposed to lobby printing from airlines.
"Ryanair-Chef Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now harvested exactly what they've sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs in the airlines had a revision.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German air insurance (DFS) offers a "stimulated training and future Pact", Maas said.
The so far announced recording of 120 Lotsenschools over the coming five years just to compensate for the elderly-related outputs.
The necessary personal construction is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees to Groupnumbau
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans for the transformation of the Group.
After the will of Thyssenkrupp-Interim's Chief Guido Churchhoff, who was appointed at the meeting on Sunday as chairman, the crystalling group is to be split into two self-employed societies.

But the demonstration is about to implement our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because this is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not coming to provoke," assured the policeman.

Musical cabaret: sex contradiction with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Such for adults as well as for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening at the hall of the Christkirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret tester, Teubner drew up the sex agreement, not only with Humor and Heart Heart for the (simplyed) woman and (simpered) husband and what else may still be, but also with music.
The mini guitar put her in and also mastered her violin.
On the wing Ben Süverkrüp sat.
It is one of the male splendid partners, who sometimes come to the end of the sentence, to the other a true pianist: So congenially accompanied Süverkrüp Teubner that some would like a solo.
It was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, as it fitted to the red fade of the evening.
There, Teubner had brought a paradoxon to play: The satisfaction of the man is coming when he has a partner, but it does not make up the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the selfbiges: What would be escaped from the composer Mozarts, would "the Nannerl" have made the door unforgettable?
So Süverkrüp runs over in improvisations, by Bachs "O Head full of blood and wounds" into the "Lied From Death", and from Mozart g-Moll symphony in a playd toast.
There were great applauses and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers exceeded Karlheinz Kleintje, a treasure master of the association, the Chansonette.

She had the idea to give up to the duo next to encountered in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as a wolbeck.

That our folk recipe so quickly bloomed in Nottuln eta, I didn't think.

From pure fruit to ecology
With a gala in Dr.-Stammberger-Maliki, the 125-year-old existence of the circular association for garden construction and national care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses were set for the Circular Association for Gardening and Landpflege Kulmbach, and in just 125 years later he celebrated a large jubilee at the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
He was still different at that time as "Cirksobstbauverein Kulmbach City and Land" he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
Also the purpose of the fruit-building association differed from today’s work - it really went purely about fruit, through flowers and garden construction at that time no one was thinking.
"In that time, in the epoch of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite son of elites," said Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his decree.
Fruit trees should clean remote roads, in schools so-called industrial gardens have been created.
The Obstanbau is still a task of the 55 garden construction clubs in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7000 members.
But this is not the spectrum at least exhausted.
Natural gardening, biological plant protection, village renunciation and diet plays an equally large role as the transfer of knowledge, healthy diet and youth work.
As far as the tasks of a garden construction association are, the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" held on stage.
"Young work is urgently necessary in the digital age," said Günter Reife Kreises, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature were for life.
The casan collection was a giant case for our children, I doubt that you can gather a lot of joy with Smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Klaus Peter Sullner.
"Where they are to stand, decide the circuit association," supplemented Landrat Söller and highlighted the special importance of the garden construction clubs for the villages.
The circular association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
This is a real concern of the many garden construction associations in the district, and there was no doubt about this also that circuit managers and special consultant Friedhelm Haun did not doubt.
He led the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the circuit association and reported, among other things, of the need for self-supply after the war.
Earlier everything came out of the garden, for winter it was taken in.
At the end of the 50s, however, the farm has changed to a boiler and housing garden.
"The nature has existed, she was already before us, and we have to focus on her," the skilled professional for fruit and nuts trees.
That is why there are the garden construction associations the encouragement to avoid leaving our home so that our home may remain beautiful and life-value.
It also belongs to welcome the new citizens in our associations, the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the explosive decline in insects, which we are guilty of our children and grandparents," Günter Reif concluded the successful festival, which was celebrated by the towers of the Music Association Thurnau.

Before the stage, the band's stimulate and pressed coincidence is done in the event.
Although "contribution" rope is not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That hardrock is not the same as hardrock, demonstrates Gitarrist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on the Bass and Schlagger Kai Hölscher with their alternatives, sometimes remembering classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" there is also a synthesizer to be used at "Here We Stand".
Not only the desirable "Take Me Home" is based on the switch of melodic passages to the guitar-lasty rock riffs of the diverse songs.
However, the Quartet "The Ignition" from Tonnishäuschen has played a special degree of knowledge since its founding in 2005.
The band presents its hardrock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" with its performances before very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the Tournees in China in 2017 - has special stage experience, is obvious and obvious.
Sängers and guitarist Tim Jungmann also puts the band with the only coverted song of the evening, "Word Up" from Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
In addition to the feelings of more controlled sound than before, Gitarrist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a thrilled solo while running through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume belongs to one such hardrock concert: The "Mint Mosquito" rock night is the according to the expression of the mixture team at the Trinity Group of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibel.
This is about the press airhammer level, but there is still a clear part of the taxation of the "Waken-Fesitval" on the "The Ignition" on its website.
However, the Ahlener Publikum does not require ear-consuming 120 decibels in dizzle-driven strength as usual as in the annual metal-stellichine in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gang type have long been convinced with their so-called, virtuosic game and their own compositions.
"We stand here, have taken the bone seeds and drove a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, freely delegated in the sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the big applause of visitors.

Trump brings Kim to him, "and then we loved"
The fact that, despite the nuclear crisis, the US President of North Korea's power holder Kim is very well-forgether, is no mystery.
Now Trump has made his colleague a regular statement of love.
It also has to do with Kims 's wonderful letters'.
At the age of 72, the married U.S. president has known to a new flame.
The tragedy: It's a remote relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made a unusual love statement to the North Korean power holder Kim Jong Un.
Before followers in the United States State of West Virginia, Trump almost found tender words for half so old spross of the ruler dynasty of Pjöngjang, although it was shown in the rings around North Korea’s atomic disarmament as quite tight breads.
"I was mad, he was also, and between us it went down and down," Trump reported.
And then we loved.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim had brought his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, there were great letters.
Their personal connection also carried political fruits: Trump refers to the stop announced by Kim of all nuclear and missile tests, even if critics do not see much more than lips.
That the affection for the "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - would not be any memoryr seemed to be conscious to the US president.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they loved".
How terrible, how terrible is this?
That's so unpresidial.
But I don't care about this, said Trump and then directed his pointing finger to the crowd of the people: "I have always said to you it is so easy to be presidial."
But then there wouldn't be 100,000 people out there in this palm filled arena, but we would only have been 200 people outside.

Refugees thanks to video saved from libysemic prison
Nigerian refugees have notified their catastrophic liability conditions in Libya with the help of a mobile video and thus enabled their salvation.
In July the group had turned the recording in her cell in the coastal city of Sawya under life threat and spread online.
"You refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here. We're dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alarmed the International Migration Organisation (IOM).
The refugees were finally fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Oh, the video couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had taken the video, the news agent AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya when attempted to get across the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he brought himself to life after his own statement.
One of his competitors was almost wrecked by the guards to death, said Onyeka.
Generally, the liability conditions were catastrophic: "They struck us all with pipes and stokes."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the Latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary repeal of refugees that are striked in Libya.
Approximately 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back this year by means of the programme to their home, said the IOM speaker in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now saved Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the bad liability conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard from a phone video call.
International organisations criticize the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps since long ago as unworthy human beings.
The North African State, which is ruled too wide parts of militia, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

Laschet must address the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Minister President Armin Laschet (CDU) has encouraged the Turkish President-in-Office Tayip Erdogan according to its own information legal state in Turkey.
The relationships of the two countries are currently "abounded", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne Airport.
This is particularly in custody waves, press and freedom of religion.
He therefore made it "decisive for Erdogan to normalise relations in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that legality is a very important prerequisite".
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He made the expectation that the freedom of opinion should be respected.
Erdogan again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The discussion of Laschet and Erdogan was short-term in a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense at the Cologne Airport.
Originally, it should have been done at Schloss Wahn - but that had rejected the castle owners from political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan went to the opening of thisib mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had a joint appearance in the construction work.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Missing confidence in the United States: North Korea calls for approx.
While US President Trump is not tired to demonstrate the successes in the negotiations on denuklearisation of North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more affordable.
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri calls for an agreement in Washington.
North Korea’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho has proposed the US government at the UN General Debate to block negotiations with its continued sanctions for an atom weapon-free Korean peninsula.
"The latest state therefore comes to build the USA on forced measures that are fatal for trust training," said Ri in New York.
It is not possible for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Not any trust in the United States will be there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we first disrupt ourselves," the North Korean Chief Diplomat led out.
That penalties of North Korea could force the "noise" would be "a desired dream of people who don't know us."
To build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear tests and missile tests and destroyed an atomic test plant, led Ri.
However, there have not been any 'reconsistent reactions' from the US side, the Minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s Atomic and Raketen programme, the UN Security Council alone had decided three times sanctions against the international isolated country last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his minister of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, in the past days, urged the United Nations to comply with criminal measures.
At the same time, the U.S. government works at an approach.
In June Trump had first met North Korea's power maker Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President pursues a second summit meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is supposed to travel again to talk about the end of the North Korean nuclear weapon programme to Pjöngjang.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youthdreff, from which the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT received nothing with: White ceilings and flower smuck on tables and a great buffet waited for guests after the harvest thanks service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with tastings from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the community for which young people wanted to thank for the food.
The beginning with the new institution was not just simple as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembered.
We had our cooling limits already filled with food and ingredients before the summer pace and were best prepared on the large day.
But on the first day after the summer break, the evil surprise came: A power loss had put the huge two-part fridge out of operation, the food was corrupt and had to be disposed.
"When we had to start again, we have got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and adolescents wanted to create it alone," says Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed up.
The result could be seen that guests were excited.
"Not only can it cook," a visitor impressed, while Hokkaido was served or the guests were allowed to serve Quiche, Leberkäse or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people put on the legs," stressed pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan lammen with card tricks and other art pieces of excitement.

Sartor is still active for the food table - "Sechs day the week, there's nothing going on," says Weilerswise.
Sartor criticized again in the "world on Sunday" criticism to colleagues of other tables.
You do not follow the approach, "without the hungry of the people in the city."
It is a task by the State to ensure that people did not hungry.
At a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin, the Essener did not participate.
"There's told me too much sweet smell," he said.

Preliminary talk at Hertha: Responseed from reality: Bayern demanded against Ajax
The predicate is indispensable thereafter: The downtown in Berlin wants the FC Bayern to "do not please".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interior for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small performance dial under the new Coach Niko Kovac should not increase for the Munichs to the larger perpetual depth.
"One week ago you had the impression that we're insistable.
Now we have collected the reality," said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0:2 low position at Hertha BSC and called for a response to the Champions-League-Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, knows that this is right, and we give us direction to Tuesday gas.

The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-between man-man-actics and the Berliners have delivered two blue peeps within three days through their playerian nail sticks to the outside, as the last exciting Bavarians are to be knocked.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we will do everything so that we can be successful again," said Kovac.
However, he was surprisingly sang with his losers in his birth town and just put his first defeat as Münchner Coach on the lack of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday, before the country's playpause, the first interior of his term of office would nevertheless be positive - otherwise, the sound would be worsening.
Kovac thus did not take any extraordinary measures before the second king class appearance of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.

"Yes, that's good already," said the national player.
It's good for the Liga.
DFB boss in Schuss Line: Özil-Causa: Scharfe Attacks of Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish President Erdogan presents a exclusion of mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Although DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post will be created.
Berlin - On various stages, recep Tayip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the deutment of the durability theme Mesut Özil.

On the early Sunday morning, the Grindel of Özil personally attacked in the Mainzer ZDF-"Sportstudio" consequences from the Causa announced.
"There's what we need to conclude in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds - we have very precise conclusions that this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as further integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel again explained that Erdogan did not stand for the values of the football and DFB.
This had provoked racism to Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with sharp words.
Our born and adult mesut Özil in Germany and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they had photographed with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in Domstadt.
I could not, however, say, as her president that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, have been expelled.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that this had "referred from the DFB" in contrast to Özil after the WM affair that had taken their start by photos with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German when I lose, I am migrant - that's not going.
"I am sorry that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said.
A basis for a return of Özils to the national team, but he does not see.
As a result, next to the Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Kamerun, a further integration officer should be called.
"If there is a clear impact on society and soccer without migration, it says, "The topic is important, there we need to take care of," that would also be an initiative to ensure a better basis for our associations where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil-Affäre, he wants to be able to communicate again for the office as a DFB President.
"I make my work and try to make it as good as it goes," Grindel said.

Switzerland starts electronic register for organspender
The register is intended to facilitate organ-dependents and discharge members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change that organs can continue to be taken only with explicit approval, Swiss Transplant emphasises.
(dpa) Switzerland starts an electronic register for organspender on this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ-dependents and discharge members in stress situations.
People who want to make their bodies available in death can be registered there.
Their wishes are then available in the case of Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change that, as in Germany, organs can only be taken with explicit consent, are emphasized by Swiss transplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss donors have a donor statement, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases a card will be found at the crucial moment when possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the discussions, the members do not know the desire of the dead person.
"They then have to decide decisively in the sense of the dead one, which is often very burdening," always says.
A similar registration system already exists in Gross Britain.
In Germany there is reasoning to store information about the possible organspende on the health card, as the speaker of the Federal Center for Health Proclamation says, Marita Völker-Albert.
"A register where people can enter their desires - per or contra Organspende - there is not," she says.
Federal Minister for Health Jens Spahn has expressed a new system of organs.
In the first place, after its proposal, everyone would be considered to be organized unless he or his relatives contradict.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.

Farmers may begin with annual knick care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmer may begin with the annual knick care on Monday.
The "green wakes" in Germany have been the countryside of the Forest-armen Bundesland for about 200 years.

Knicks combine as corridore's scattered living spaces, which can still work on the exchange of organisms, as the Managing Director of the Nature Protection Association of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living tears
The knicks were established on the basis of a command from the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "leading tears" were not only field limitation and livestock, they also delivered the farmers firewood and bars for their professional houses.
From this time, still his name "Knick" still comes: "Thicken" of the acets could develop the dense, painted restrictions.
Today, around 45,000 kilometers of the hooks between North and East Sea, the image of a wooden, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by approximately 7000 species as a spare lifespace.
In a kilometers of knick can live up to 1800 different species and breach up to 30 bird pairs.
His ecological important function, however, can only satisfy the knick if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
In other words, Ludwichowski said, as well as the diversity of the species, he surrounds a light tree.
Knick care may only be operated outside the gross time of October to March after information from the Ministry of Agriculture.
After Tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesian speaks about SItuation on site
The local Radika Pinto in interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) describes the situation locally on the island of Sulawesi after earthquakes and the Tsunami:
Was you on site during the Tsunamis?
No, I was at the time in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then when I learned about the Tsunami, I went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight, I had to drive more than 20 hours of car, as the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has opened the airport again so that aid goods can be fled into.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisorically set up something where we have also spent other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are driven on surrounding hills, where they still endure from fear of another Tsunami and earthquakes and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some of them keep up from their homes, there are still afterbeams.
Because many food shops and the tank stations are completely closed, people are partly crying food and petrol.
The public service has been totally dropped, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners are partially running around and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not been found and are missing.
How are communications and information services running on the island?
At the moment we have received mobile phone receipts, but before we did not work, and we have only received information about the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who do not know whether they live and where they stop, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, on the work.
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information about it?
We don't know the reasons for it, but when the warning came, many "Okay, no Tsunami" thought - and then he came.
In other regions which were not affected by Tsunami, there was lack of information that a Tsunami falls on the region and they are driven to the surrounding mountains.
Is not a island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific fire ring, prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst thing here.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is broken together, the earthquake has hit many people.

Board Kavanaugh: FBI research in the Turbotempo
The time is extremely small and the number of planned enterprises is strongly limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to ensure the hook-dunning majority for the accrued judge candidates board Kavanaugh because of the need for enquiries.
President Donald Trump has set a period until Friday to clarify the discretional incidents of over 30 years.
The recent turn in the drama around the profession of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural campaign was dissolved on Friday.
Following a eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the jurisdiction of tirates was exposed to the oppositional democracies, the Senat Jurisdiction Committee should make the way free for the final confirmation of the court of the court of the jurisdiction at the Supreme US court.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared his original announcement that he would agree, but would require an FBI investigation.
After tumorlike scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still referred to the heavy preservations on Thursday as "decisive," first encountered further attacks against women and spoke in contrast of "gluek in unheart".
In this way, last doubt could be cleared, he said.
Later, Trump attacked democrats sharply in a election discouraged because she refused Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."

FC Schalke 04 after Sieg against Mainz: You have felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first seasonsieg against Mainz.
The relief on Scalke is large after the first seasonsieg.
Nevertheless, the time factor was also a matter of play against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - Meanwhile, Christian Heidel is known as a giant pessimist in football games.
That was not different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and atmete.
Finally, the king’s blues were able to bring the almost 1:0 against the Rhineshessen over the time and thus bring the first seasonsieg under roof and trade.
It could have come differently.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11. The team of headtrainer Domenico Tedesco had given Tedesco security: "In the sum the first half of time was good, both playable and pressing".
Do not actually shoot a headball memory
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours," he said, "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand that".
The guys were afraid to give it out of the hands and therefore keep moving back.
And with man and mouse defend against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no incredible share with his headball driver, "I was actually created by the worst headball player in the man."
But at the end only the win is.
The enlightenment was felt in the entire arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start pressurefully in the early phase and make a firework from it," Schalkes Chefcoach said.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageously, so we have to go to parties over 90 minutes
The most important manko of the afternoon: King blue missed it rather for clearer conditions of concern.
The opportunities for this were finally there, for example, through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the late 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't become a cittersieg," said Tedesco, "you have felt the fear already a little".
That's why I'm glad that we won.
He was not the only Scalker.

El-Mafaalani grows much more lock in the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic understandable.
With a lot of getics, hand-fired numbers and some widow he brings the listeners one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why is there growing conflicts despite successful integration?
The syric standing author uses the question of a metapher.
On a table, the German society is sitting on the cattle table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always been sitting on the big table and now want to agree.
That's about conflicts.
Therefore, not whether one or she is politically right or left, but, "I am on or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
In the beginning of behavior, then the discussion round is running.
And there is a need for speech.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or not successful integration in students.
El-Mafaalani stands on, not on stage, a sense of discussion: It's on eye height.
Sociology professor does not encourage his opinion, stressed that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that interest exists in the topic because "First, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the next signing hour, he still became an open ear for the guests' questions and also in the foyer, in prepared Kurdish specialities, intensely discussed.

So Schalkes Naldo "great sport" also at the bank
For the third time, it is not in the first stage: Naldo is still thankful at Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time, not in the Schalker Startelf but on the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two meters of Brazil had just spoken the frustration of the soul.
But when the Scalker players gathered over the FSV Mainz 05 as living in the middle circle and thanked for the headtrainer Domenico Tedesco at all his professionals, the 36-year-old who called all the simple Naldo one and said: "We have to thank train!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," later Tedesco said about the reaction of his vize chapitän, who, in spite of his new reservoir-to-date, did not have any groll.
True, Naldo, who was celebrated in the past season as a best sculptor, knows that he is actually not in charge of his trainer, but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called 'lasting control'.
It was not easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him that I tell you very honestly," said Tedesco of the moment when he said Naldo that he was not in the base.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the association," founded Tedesco the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that all of us can get through at present.
And that we all keep in the boat," said Tedesco, the rotation that was last fought by Naldo.
And the Brazilians responded to the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself at the bank as an exemplary team player.
