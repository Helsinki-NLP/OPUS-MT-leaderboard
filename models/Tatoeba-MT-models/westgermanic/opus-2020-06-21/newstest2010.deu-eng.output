Barack Obama receives the Nobel Prize of Peace as the fourth US President
The U.S. President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to take the peace nobel price here as the fourth US president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check over 1.4 million dollars for its extraordinary efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives with his wife Michelle in the northwestern Metropole tomorrow and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he attends the Nobel Institute, where he meets with the five members of the Committee, who have chosen him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The President-in-Office then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
At midnight the visit reaches its highlight with the ceremony, where Obama takes over the Prestige Prize.
It will be received as the fourth US President, but only as the third, who takes the price directly in the office.
The White House already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan War when taking the price.
The President does not want to deviate this issue because he knows that it takes over the price as a president who is currently carrying war into two countries.
He has strengthened war tensions several days ago by sending further forces to Afghanistan, which does not forget any of his critics.
In the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (ca. 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to spend for well-employed purposes, but through a concrete caritative work he has not yet decided.
The event programme will then provide a banket with the President and his wife, with which the Prime Minister and other 250 invited guests will be present except Norway's King and Queen.
Obama was very retaining from the beginning of the price.
He was exemplary that he felt that he did not deserve the price completely.
He also repeated that it was not only the price for him, especially for those who are seeking the same values as he did.
Soon after the notice, he found that this is "requirement for action" for him.
Nature Protector is accused of depression
The Leitmeritz Police accused the President of the Citizen Association of Natural Protection, Leitmeritz, for depression.
In several cases he launched professionals against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his professions he demanded money from the investors, said the Leitmeritz Police Speaker, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Natural Protection Communityist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and it threatens him a prison sentence from up to three years.
The sorting volume containers in Brno aren't called good
In Prague, people can sort the drinking packagings, in the southern towns you will find again on step and step up the sorting garbage containers.
And in Brünn?
There you need to rent a few minutes to find the appropriate tones of waste.
I don't want to claim that waste separation wouldn't work at all at all in Brünn.
But it seems to me that the Presidents of the Council are inadequate for this problem even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the divorce of waste in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of just paper, glass and plastics in the sort containers, but above all by the waste tonnes of waste for such waste.
Have they tried in the center, for example, to dispose of the PET bottles in a collective basket?
That's just art, before all it needs time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found randomly is the male place opposite the encountered Gans.
Mr Unterka should not be angry with his colleagues, but this is too little for me.
Notwithstanding that waste separation is also not a honey sleak in other parts.
So all of my friends do not sort the waste.
From fatigue.
It is too far to the tons of waste.
I'm not surprising.
I offered even after the celebration to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Conicova Street, I didn't see any colour fill tons in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place in the roadway.
But the waste was almost over.
This is still the centre of Brünn, which represents the whole city, is not true?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably allow the brothers of socialists to be cold.
They prefer to buy the city an iceockeyliga that makes us harm throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few tons of waste more and offer the sort of further raw materials for a cleaner brown.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my adoption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the EKO-COM society, Brünn is really the worst in the whole district of southern metres.
The "Paroubek" budget has dismissed the money for pensions and sickness money
In spite of the government's view, the left party gave more money to farmers and officials, no more money is available in the budget for pensions, sickness money and building savings.
However, not for state debt rates or for international disputes.
This causes even more problems that will be at the government in the second half of the next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists persisted the increase in the salary for some groups, they calculated that the government pays the money for the sensitive expenditure, age pensions or for the sickness money. "It is only a breakdown of the problems in the future, mines," says Janota.
The loans are paying increasingly higher interest rates, and the money must be refunded at some time.
Too much to choose where, the state cassette is empty.
If social services or costs are not reduced for State business, taxes should be increased.
For all those who now gave the left party more money: the fire war, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for her children.
In order to lose pensions or health money from account 1,8 billion, people need no fear to get this money.
But by the price that the State is still more guilty - the next year, it will not only miss 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of the Janota Minister, the debt will increase as soon as possible, together with these, the costs and interest rates.
The State will need the money for compensation, then the tax on VAT will not be sufficient to increase or shorten the maternity money as the government made in its counterparty package.
The next year, five billion for the development of cars and railways will also be missing because of money growth for some electoral groups.
It is mainly the sections obtained in competition that you can no longer project and may afford.
Most of all receive what is not free.
This means moving or setting up thirty large buildings, also threatened by Europe, warns the ministerial of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD suggested that it solves the flow of money salmonically - it addresses the CEZ-actividents with which the State is owner of mathematicality and then distributed the money into the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never safe and there is no infinite source.
Last year, CEZ flowed 18 billion to the budget.
Each year, the dividends shall pay the environmental liquidations, the pension account and this money serve as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick beyond the EU rules, the actual budget deficit increases to the Nieveau of 5.7 percent GDP.
This does not end the carnival of transformations yet.
The budget for various compensations for the victims of Communism and of criminal acts or for expenditure for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether or not the state comes without this money is not safe.
That's a pure gambling game.
If we lose an international jurisdiction, then we have to pay for it, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister must then save the money resort intermediately or attack the government budget reserve in the worst case.
One hundred million lack also for the already started two billion project "State Chess" to monitor on-lines for what the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance should not find the money elsewhere, the project should be stopped and in this case come sanctions, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single key.
The plans submitted are promising.
It is enough to press only one key, and from Windows Mobile will be switched within less seconds.
The U.S. Society wants to imagine VMware, which focuses on the development of the virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to carry out two user profiles at the same time on the phone.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, depict Srinivas Krishnamurti from the company VMware at the interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
On the market it will come in 2012.
The virtualization of smart dogs is not a fiction.
VMware successfully launched the journalists the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, at the same time, running Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of the new mobile technology is in full train.
Now the company VMware is working together with the European and American operators at the smartphone virtualization and the customer is supposed to come to the devices within 2012.
Snow lack on the mountains the owners of the hotel
Snee-free pistes do not only concern the giant mountains.
The missing snow also scares the people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, you can still receive free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and Silvester.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but now they are afraid of ordering binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether we think this year's Christmas festival will be on snow or "on math", the operator of the Information Portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, started.
If you want the silvester stay in the spindlemill according to his ideas, no longer should hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer the saving and where the quality of the stay comes at second place, can try to wait for a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer only weekly stays for the Silvester day.
I think they will have a while to try to sell them for a while but then they have to imitate, and enter them at a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, estimated Jandura.
Free beds at all winter dates always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now most of us are interested in the Christmas week, which is not now sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some more price-effective Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the Travel Office Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi booking office can also offer the silvester day in Giant Mountains, but there are less free places here.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold averagely.
This year, the interest for winter stay is also negatively influenced by the fact that in giant mountains there is always no snow.
People wait if snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end in the mountains without snow.
If the pistes are cut within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, shifts.
Reverse and a little better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are around five percent better than in the previous year.
On the Day of Silvester and on Christmas we have only a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will run well, the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Omnia Hotel is also occupied at the Central Parking in Janske Lazne.
At Christmas, the latest hotel in Janske Lazne remains half of the beds.
Apparently, this year of January, for which we are already occupied at about 60 percent.
A little weaker is between February, but in the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountain will also increase, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
In the meantime, the Giant Mountain owners are waiting for a larger snow cup.
On Thursday it should be cool and if it comes to rainfall, that should be on the mountains of snow.
But then there will be a warming, Jori Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Recurrence is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost funny, with which school striving Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the cluster, repeated the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question that he himself felt for the foolst.
When he finally looked forward to his desirablely expected Afghanistan doctrine, it showed that he wrote this three years ago about the copyright paper from the Busch-Irak scenario.
Not only that in the text itself, he used the word "like in Iraq", he even used the name of the Bush declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forwardway", without being saturated.
He himself, three years ago, criticized the Bush Idea - fresh troops quotas in the civil war - as "unresponsive and in their consequences of caratrophic decision".
On the following months, however, it was shown that the Bush strategy, which was given by the military recommendations, was the only possible and so far very successful that the news about Iraq was no longer spoken today.
The call Bushs was not improved, since he has left a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected to be.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle is repeated.
In order to increase the troop quota, he asked the militarys again, especially the head commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, criticized the devastating shelters in the White House.
He demanded 400,000 soldiers to convert the situation to better.
The President delayed three months, but did not get any better idea and so he deceived the General by 100,000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the commitment for more 5,000 even if he was originally counting at least 100,000.
Highest problematic at the whole Obama strategy is his project to withdraw the drops from Afghanistan in 18 months and end this process within three years. The whole Obama doctor leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half of the increase will bring the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Despite the brother war in recent years, Iraq's community has been relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghanic situation is characterised by the contra-indication - to nobody can be left and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces who are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even though they have been formally properly established, remain only meadows behind which the patriarchal family relations will continue to grow.
The equity of interest between the various ethnic groups is unusually complex, especially because of the inadequacy of the conditions that the Pakistan and Iran influences continue to complicate.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "treatable state" which is the minimalistic goal of the whole operation.
Timehorizont of the Obama Strategy is alienated by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and now it is at the edge of the explosion.
That believes that the small soldiers who are broken into the war shout on the "Frehheimkehr" can create a miracle here can only be a truly romantic soul that does not impress themselves from facts.
From the political view, the date set for the drop deduction is pure responsibility, because the Taliban will take up it as the indirect agreement of the American defeat.
The last NATO Summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fights in Afghanistan is in a minor way.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain their voters in what way the security of Germany or Italy relates to the war in Hinduc-Birgsvoorland.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of the events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iranians, it is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem is not to be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America is crying for the winner deduction from Afghanistan to Obama.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic turnover of Afghan situation.
The only comfortpflaster for Barack Obama is the fact that there is still three years until the presidential election, so it will remain enough time to take a different strategy, and it would be considered as a total loss.
The managers of the Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premiums in bar
The executive leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs are no longer given premium bonus this year.
This has announced the company that responds to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, shares may be discharged to managers in the case if they act hazardously.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, focuses on the top of the efforts to connect the Wall Street premium with long-term performance.
I think the Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which she has to go, the former banker of the JPMorgan society, periodicals Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target of criticism after she had sided almost 17 billion dollars for the first three quarters of this year for premium bonuses.
The total height of the premium bonus in the course of this year will probably exceed 20 billion dollars after the Reuters Agency, despite today's action.
The high premium in the banking sector has become the hotest political issue at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, the UK reported that the bonus of the bankers, over 25,000 pounds exceeding, was once charged by a tax of 50 percent.
Similarly, France also prepares.
This year, women won the Nobel Prizes in all specialities except in physics.
Today, five record women have taken over this year's Nobel prices in Stockholm from the royal of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romania, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with her countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromosonic area.
The price for Chemistry has received the Israeli Ada Jonath, along with the American, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for enlightenment of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last laureatin gave the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for the analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, the scientists Charles Kao have carried this price for research in the glass fiber area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD Chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical remote tube.
Each of these winners has the diploma that receives nobel medals and certificates on the purchase of the money price.
It is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price is divided among them.
Traditionally, the US President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected peace nobel price in Oslo today afternoon.
In his speech, he recognized the controvere of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his way, and, beyond, standing at the top of the country which leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in the preservation of his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for fighting world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers the return. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus received on Friday early the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who thinks about his retirement in the government, because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Members' Assembly on Wednesday.
It will be assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
He says that the fate deficit is too high, which further increases the crisis of public finances.
The chairman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday.
According to the budgetary Act, which is now given to Klaus, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, the Parliament was agreed on the left party proposals on money change and increased the money for the officials, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government resisted the proposals for social democracy that it covers the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one side and the government, Klaus and Legal Party, on the other side, there is a sharper domestic dispute, whose question mark comes on the further work of the fishermen's office cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Criticians claim that the budget, as adopted by the Parliament, is practically liquidated by the package of saving measures that have been carried out by the fishermen government in the autumn, and that should, after understanding, end state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the government budget, but does not have to, today stated in the question of discussion with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have disregarded the "natural problem", the "integrable deficit" of public finances.
He believes that there is no good solution today.
Improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, found that the budget is cruel, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said to the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, no longer works.
Premier Fischer referred to similar words in the editorial action as "strong statements".
The CSSD-Chef, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek wound that the Etat Defizit was grieving that the former government of Topolanek had prepared this year and exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the State budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unsense" of the world shows much of the country, of which, despite some criticisms, that the main role was occupied by an American actress.
History tells about sports, race relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The unreasonable fighter against the Rassist Apartity Government System in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life history of the American Oscar Schau Player, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked of the one-new-year-old Mandela whether he could represent him in Eastwood film.
Another meaningful role takes Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'll play you, I need to meet you.
The two and seventy-year-old actor, who had received the price for his role in Eastwood Drama from the "Million Dollar Baby" box, already represented the leader of the movement to eliminate slavery, from which, at the end of the slave holder, a fictional president of the United States, and also God in "Evan Almighty," but only rarely someone who is alive and is as important for many people as Mandela.
For 27 years, the former South African Stateman was imprisoned for his active activity in the termination of the apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990, and for four years he became President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Prize of Peace.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unsensitive," and at the same time it is the name of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley, who was released in 1875.
The request was how to speak
The film illustrates a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to some of the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remain still racely and economically divided.
He believes that he can do some of his people through sports, so he decides to some of the Rugby players, belonging to the outside sides worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the Weltcup of 1995.
Freeman worked several years to bring the Mandela history to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than playing this role so much to approach it as close as possible of reality, Freeman said.
The greatest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actress said if he and the world politician would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, eat with him in the evening and be before his speech behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I have detected if I shake your hand, I take your energy, it's being transferred, and I felt that I know what you feel, he said.
For me it is important to become another person.
Matt Damon represents the film François Pienaar, captain of the national Rugbyteam, in which the white players were overwhelming.
The actress said that he had six months of time to prepare for the role in the hard Rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I sounded to the doorklingel that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I see much larger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the scenic of the actors compared to their actual examples, he has received positive reviews under the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unsensitive" and one also speaks of views on an Oscar.
The film critic of the sheet Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages redtentomatoes.com, Invictus 76 percent has received positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway solved: The Russians have tested a rocket
About Norway, a special light effect was to observe unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has only admitted yesterday that an intercontinent ballistic missile was tested across the Norwegian border.
However, the start was not successful again and the rocket called "Bulava", which originally should be the pride of Russian army, will slowly become the Alpine of Russian Generality and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence in the rocket test also did not have a positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava has mostly not been started or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers you already write about "Bulava" as a "reakete that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights.
This already 13. Trying, in the beginning, fell normal.
At the end of the flight, technical damages have occurred again on the rocket.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket level.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atomic U-Boot Dmitry Donskij, which went under the water of the White Sea.
This rocket type allows the burst from the U-Boot.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indecisive flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Furthermore, since the first moment, Norwegers have not doubted that it is a Russian rocket.
This time, the Generality has retained itself and claimed that you cannot clearly speak of a success.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the accident was only affected by the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if there was no test start without error, the management of the defense Ministry is only considered six of 13, as follows.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism, so it continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even wear up to ten hypersall atomspreng caps with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary of the Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov presents itself in a professional ockey game for 51 years.
The former World Championist, Olympiaseger and Stanley Cup - Inhaber helps his team CSKA Moscow in the emergency, and probably already acting in the Fridaysduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career with 40 years, in 1998, is president of the CSKA at the time.
After denis Kulja's injured, we urgently need another fighter.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some formalities, the Agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous iceockey player will only affect a game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of these who can raise the morals of other players has led to the player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he will go to AP of the oldest Russian professional iceockey game.
In the NHL the legendary storm Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with one-fifty years and was able to benefit from 15 hits and 26 assistances.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice ockey players in history.
In the Dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic Goldmedals, seven World Champional Titles, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gathered successes in the NHL, where he had two times the Stanley Cup over the head in Detroit-Dress.
He has been a member of the iceockey star room since 2001.
Heundai imposed the trade unions. All hours are raised
The management of the Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai agreed with the union to repeal all hours.
As a result of frequent overtime, the union announced the stress preparation on Monday.
This confirmed the speaker of the Hyundai automotive factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management of the trade unions still wants some over a Saturday layer this week.
We should not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, it was proposed voluntary hours for the reason that two work layers would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday history.
The employees will also receive their employees for the Saturday history of 28 November.
Vanek said that the company decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the overtime proposed.
Of course, they can pay for overtime or take replacement holiday on December 28, and thus extend the Christmas days, Vanek started.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday history are paid the bicycle and lunch.
Given the fact that overtimes of the most urgent and burning point relating to claims and complaints of the trade unions who had set up production last week, the management of business has decided with immediate effect on the withdrawal of all hours for the month of December, Vaněk started.
The automotive factory employees had been forced to work for almost every day after the eight hours.
In the signing of the agreement, the strike preparation will be repealed by the unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions are expected to be reached on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can sign some and a common document, they are willing to remedy the stress.
The situation in the automotive factory has been closed last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees were spontaneously traveling because of continuous overtime hours.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and promising shanes.
The management held that the employees had to make overtimes in order to comply with the automotive life needs.
The trade unions also demanded that the employees who had interrupted production were not engaged in sanctions during their Monday striking call for stress.
In the area of overtime, trade unions call for a minimum reduction of overtime work.
In addition, they call for the payment of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice motor factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Series production has been started in the company last year in November.
Until this September, some 80,000 vehicles have been manufactured here, which currently amount to 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects HIV viruses.
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new connections to interfere with the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are resistant to medicines.
This fact exceeds the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not act as strong as one of the already existing medicines.
The AIDS disease cannot be healed yet.
However, the patient can extend the composition of medicines and prevent the increase of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a number of adverse reactions.
Incomplete oppression of virus increase has also the development of resistant viruses against which no medicines are more effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (Chemisch-Technological Hochschule) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have proved that the substances referred to as Metalocarborane work on the protein substance responsible for reproduction of the HIV virus.
The metal carboranes are tied to Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These connections block the virus increase in a different way than all of the medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistence problem.
In their work, scientists are able to prepare new 'professional' connections prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the viral protein.
The metal carboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two varied cages consisting of Bor-, hydrogen- and carbon-atoms and connected by a metal-atom, in this case cobalt.
Hometic and persistent virus
HIV protease is protein substance of HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV virus palm, no mature infection virus particles would be created.
If we disable the HIV protease, we also disable the increase of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report released by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of connections in which two couples of the cabs (see Table) are linked by a short organic chain which will then be systematically changed.
Something weaker, but more reliable
The impact of this series of substances against HIV protease is tested in the reagense glass, including against its persistent (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarboranes on the usual enzym variants is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants against which the medicines used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of effectiveness and its further characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical designs, makes metalocarborans an interesting connection for further development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institutes for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Medicine of Sciences.
Fight for budget. ODS went on fishermen who refused
The President of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for the next year as "great" and the Government of Premier Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS was called the President of the Minister as "strong exclaims".
It is supposed to be time for analysis.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, is apparently no longer working.
After Necas, the President of the Minister must decide whether he intends to support the minority in Parliament, if it is the fight against the increasing deficit, or whether it is his retirement in the office with the help of Parliament's links.
The approach of the ODS and the social democracy to the problems of public deficits is diametrically different, and Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, the Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, but with link-party amendments over over 12 billion crowns.
The Parliament has increased the money for officials, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government resisted the proposals of social democracy that it covers the budget deficit.
Chemistry should have a 163 billion crown resistance.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has come to the government's wish, as the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget.
Disappointment and unthinkableness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a senseless feeling, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer suggested that the government still assesss the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened with his return for the case that the amendment proposals would be adopted that the situation would look differently.
According to Czech television, Janota has logged in at the premiere for Monday after the government business.
He stated that he resided in the office.
The reason for this is his disappointment on the budget's grounds.
As far as fishermen speak for the further fight with the budget deficit, it is possible that, in accordance with Necas, the Nominants of the Social Democracy (CSSD) who had made changes in the budget did not do anything in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that it will come back if Parliament continues to accept deficit increaseing laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or the service law innovation.
Topolanek: Minister nominated by ODS did not fault
This is the case of the premier fishermen and the whole government.
The Ministers nominated by ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text release from the United States.
It has noted that in some ministries there are deputy functions of people recognized to TOP 09 who agreed against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to avoid the fight against the level of deficit of public finances " it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left majority currently in Parliament".
Then it is supposed to not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the citizens.
I have not thought about it, and if this will be up to date, I will take care of it, the Minister of Democrats, who is nominated by the Defence Minister Martin Bartak, said to the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer fled at the meeting of the European Council to Brussels in the afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote in Parliament on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the citizens to accept the budget.
We do not occur as a wound children, we are not children, then he responded to the question whether the ODS was not repressed by the absence of the party president in Parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice that my voice would be missing.
Even when I poisoned to the mandate, I knew that it was most important for the Parliament's Bolshevization and destruction to do everything, Topolanek responded to himself in the next months.
Following the new CD (Tschechian Railway) ride fewer trains for about the same price.
The Czech railway completed or restricted some less charged rapid and local trains from December 13th, while other connections are strengthened.
The total transport volume will be reduced from the date of validity of the new travel plan compared with today by two percent.
Most prices including base and customer travel fees are not changed.

The flight will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less quicker trains will also be driven on the Prague route - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction plans the railway in the Hradec Kralove district, in total by eight percent, to an increase in Prague and the environment.
Removal of two night tracks on the Prague route - Tabor - Budweis and a few days in the week the operation of some quick trains on the Prague route - Pisek - Budweis is reduced.

The distances to the capital will end at the Prague capital destination station.
The CD introduces more lines of connection SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will drive from two hours.

This year's account for regional demand train: rise by 200 million
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, totally the railway receives four billion crowns to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year.
This year, regional trains are more than 200 million Czech crowns.
The railway has completed a ten-year contract for the local trains and the quick trains until now the contract has always been completed for a year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it has not also been awarded the price increase in the large majority of the routes.
Changes include only one day's network vehicle CD Net and cheap internet vehicles eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD is increased from 450 krones to 600 krones.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven stacks until now he was united for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.

Millitant today, in the south of the Philippines, found 75 people, including some basic school students and their teachers.
This led to the Agency AFP, which originally informed about 65 delegated.
All 17 preserved children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.

But on Tuesday the peace negotiations with the Phillippine government have resumed.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
The new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes in the American cinemas "Invictus: the Depressed", which includes part of the life history of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against the apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, who was supposed to have been chosen by Mandela himself several years ago.
Matt Damon has received the side artist role of legendary South African Champions in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
The film's cinema starts also loud reactions by critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
He is called Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar prize, then in 1993 with the Klerk the Nobel Prize of Peace.
He was elected to President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Large expectations will be placed in the film because in a time it comes into the cinema, where, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Championship cuminate, but the media simultaneously shaken the world publicity with fearful news about the increasing race hat and discrimination of the inhabitants of the black-running majority.
According to the news agency AP, reactions to the new film in South Africa are mainly positive, despite many preservation against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is his own word after the new movie yet proud.
From this role I have made many years, and I have prepared it well.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that, as you say, I can receive his energy, he opened in interview after the festival premiere of the movie in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can clean up with this movie on Mandelas's personality and his message.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he supplemented.
In the Dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book template of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that the people united, portrays the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is trying to assemble two groups of races and since each other, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also acts in his role in the South Africa National Rugby Address on the Weltcup field, which then won South Africa.
For the entertainment of the racial in the Dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations for fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may bring the people together again to a single people, the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "Schwarze" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the stressed situation in South Africa improves that will only show itself.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, such as in recent interview for the Rugby Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The Championship begins on 11 June 2010.
Burning transformers in the Louny area for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out tomorrow at the transformator of society Ceps in the switch plant at the municipality of Vischov in the Louny area.
At the fire, according to the speaker of the district firewehr Usti nad Labem, Luke Marvan, six units entered.
Originally, the fire war wanted to let the transformers burn out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is deleted with a mixture of water and special lubricants.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformator-in-cursion closure.
No one was injured, the Havarie threatened in accordance with the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the management system.
The damage has been estimated to several 10 million crowns, the damage will be more precisely after the fire.
The decaded transformer must be replaced by a new mandatova.
For more than 10 years, Ceps' society has not done any similar, errors of this kind are rare, supplemented.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesman of the company CEZ for Nordbohmen, Sona Holingerova, by the fire of the trafo station, was not influenced the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is operated in the Czech area as a single operator of the management system, the electrical pipelines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates, and develops 39 switching facilities with 67 transformers that transfer the electrical energy into distribution system and lead track with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises criminal admission for slandering against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal advertency against three social-democratic leaders.
==References====External links==*References====External links====External links==*References====External links==
Jancura said this in a 20-minute inteview in the Radiojournal.
The complaint depends on the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some districts.
All regions have, however, signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the rosins, with this we only submitted the offer on the scale of how it was voted with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that had been completed last week.
So nothing else remains to us than to wake us.
Jancura said to the Radiojournal because of this blast of society Student Agency.
At the same time, he found evidence from all districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with Europe law.
That is why we prepare a complaint for the European Commission.
Hasek holds the survey of the criminal advisory for the further continuation of Jancura mediashow, which serves him as free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name as well as the good reputation of my district, and I also demand further leaders.
I assume that in this matter it will also be clear that Jancura, who manipulates the public in the matter of regional insensation and uses lying and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million crowns into the advertising that will point to the disadvantaged step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he disrupted the campaign after Christmas and wished to continue after the New Year.
He stressed that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
Jancura has launched the campaign after the regions agreed to operate the regional railroad with the Czech railway and had no invitation to tender in a high by 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and in contradiction with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of train in the districts, Jancura said that he was also a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we do not forget that we can also lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name today, Jancura said the Radiojournal.
vaccination against pneumocokken free of charge and voluntary
Imfection against pneumocokken changes the resident from January.
It's supposed to be the first to be free and volunteer for the families.
But now, votes have already been reported that the duty-Implementation would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumocokken.
The Arznei Institute already determines the maximum prices of vaccines which need to pay health insurance.
Experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
vaccines free of charge for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumocokken, which were born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received any vaccination.
Anyone who has begun vaccination in last year or earlier must also pay further recovery vaccination itself.
The first vaccination dose must be given between the child's 3 and 5.
Last year a quarter of the families had been implanted their children against pneumocokken.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for vaccination of recent children.
On the whole, the experts appreciate that the health insurance for the vaccination doses spend 30,000 to 450,000 krones per year.
But they save in treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state has issued about 500,000 a year for all the surface vaccinations of the children.
The duty vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococks cause medium urine inflammation, but also severe infections including brain shooting inflammation and blood toxication.
Due to pneumocokken infections, we die after study in hospitals a year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Apart from the Czech Republic, children's duty was introduced against pneumocokken in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be required?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be duty in the future.
From January, this should be paid and voluntary by the insuranceers.
For example, the head of Nahlas's civil union, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the duty-Implementation would be better.
His union has been commenced for the pneumocokken vaccination for long-term time.
The experts at the international conference on which our association was involved were not very satisfied to have voluntary vaccination.
That's not really ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to carry out at least that.
I think that this is the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led to.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumocokken.
At this moment we don't consider that at all, his speaker Vlastimil Sesen said.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, claims the doctors.
The chairman of the professional society of practical child doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all the children were vaccinated, then you could think about the reduction in the rate of repetition "In a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of the parents to implant their nurses against pneumocokken from next year.
The vaccination against pneumocokken is also obvious that it is paid as the first surface vaccination by the health insurance schemes and not by the state.
Insurances should issue the money for the prevention so that they can save for further treatment Cabrnochova.
The doctors need to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, there is a concern for the practical child physicians that concerns the shopping of vaccines.
After the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and the doctors will then receive them on the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that insurance could "follow the money from health insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy and wait for the vaccines to pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will need to invest 400,000 crowns per month, which is an important sum.
That's not gonna be easy, Cabrnochova says.
US artisansohn involved in "Museumsdiebstahl"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused to want paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken into his vehicle when invited 90 paintings.
It says that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used a bagger to get into the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for its representation of forms like Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
According to the news agency Associated Press, the artist stopped at the time of the event in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feather.
The Agency reported that, according to a police-owned declaration, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was assigned by his father, "that he should insist in the museum with all means to bring all paintings into a camp".
The Agency noted that Frank Frazetta Senior ordered to have granted permission.
Labour defends eating and tax increases
Ministers have defended the criticism of opposition, economic and trade unions, the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the preliminary report.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had had a chance "disrupted" to show that he was seriously meant with the reduction of the deficit by extinguishing the decisions until the election.
The treasure Chancellor also called for a target for workers with low and medium-sized income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1-procent coverage limit of public wage accounts for 2011.
Social Insurance Agricultural Insurance
However, the trade unions have protested that low wage recipients are punished for a recession which they have not caused and warned against the above "subscribed" problems.
The increase in social insurance - to about 3 billion British pounds per year - has intimidated the private economy, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the eye should be on economic growth.
The increase limited to those earning more than 200,000 £ per year will affect approximately 10 million workers.
PARTICULARS OF THE FORABILITY REPORT
Proceeding of social insurance by more 0.5 % from April 2011
Over this year, the economy's reduction by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50 % station on banking bonuses
1 per cent of increase in body taxes for small enterprises
Tax deposits for electrical vehicles and wind turbines
An increase in State pension by 2.5 %
According to estimates of the Office, someone with an annual income of 30.000 £ 90 £ per year will be poorer and someone with $40,000 per year will be more poor by 190 £, while a person with 110 £ billion annual income will be more rich.
Ministers said that their goal of deficiency was to be "swore decisions" until 2013, but they also said that 60 % of the loads of additive taxes would fall to the 5% of the top ministers.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms said that the skilled tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"They are great numbers. They will bring us the deficiency half and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said that he was confident that the economy would return to growth until the end.
The Labour party's predictions on the future economic growth – which affects the extent of reschuld and the speed of deficiency - were questioned after the treasurer was forced to revision previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy will probably shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the decline of 3.5%, which was foretold in April – while the debt would be over 3 billion dollars before.
"Passted opportunity"
The conservatives who would like to start a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn the "Schuldenkrisis" of Labour, said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds was content over the next six years.
They added that the Ministers have failed to present a credible plan as they will be repaid and "zynic" before difficult decisions to be taken until the election - the latest in June 2010.
"They have said nothing of importance about what they will do," said the shadow-financing minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they left them pass away."
"The important announcements are made after the choice, whoever they win".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour ensures that schools, hospitals and police are preserved from future reductions, different from the proposals of the conservatives, which will see the defizit capulations coming faster and faster.
But the liberal democrats said that the money obtained by the tax increases and expenditure stops are not used to cover expenditure for the next year to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were "builded on sand".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that some would suspend the preface of voting, as the above inflation adjustment to some invalid pensioners in the next April, because the money could be recovered in the next year.
Labour is persisting to provide extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed again in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the Ministers did not know more than 2011, economians say that the pressure on public expenditure will only come to bear medium-term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Research said that the figures of the treasurer would mean strong deductions in many areas, perhaps in future also in transport, university education, science and defense areas.
"It only relocates pain later," said his head Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made after the election, whoever wins it," added Roger Bootle, economic consultants to the Economic Testing Company Deloitte.
"This was only the hot pre-etat report. The markets recognize that."
FBI studied "Festings of U.S. citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI examines the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens due to the sudden extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested on a house in Sargoda, in the eastern Pandshab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan of the BBC.
The FBI said that it is examined whether that is the same men, the last month has been reported in Virginia as missing.
The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that she also seeks information about the men.
Three of them should be Pakistan origin, one is Egyptian origin, and the other has a Jemenite background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the accusations that are being thrown before them and under which circumstances they are held," said Sprecher Ian Kelly.
The FBI-speaker Katherine Schweit said that the Authority was informed of the arrests and was related to the families of the most missing students.
"We work with the Pakistan authorities to find out their identity and the purpose of their stay in that place if it are the most missing students," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house before and that no claims have been filed against the arrested men.
The news agent Reuters reported that it refused Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States must "collaborate with Afghanistan and Pakistan in extinguishing the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty sentenced "Missbräuche" in Iran
According to a report from the Amnesty International Human Rights Organisation, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report is detailed by the regime, both before and after the President-in-Offices in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another man said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has returned its former criticism of human rights balance.
Official bodies said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the challenging election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedskad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens killed, which led to the greatest street tests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Thousands of penalties and prosecutors received say that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Theran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leaders, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closing of the Kahrizak sports event.
But since then there was no more tolerance for criticism from the authorities, our correspondent said.
Flexible Approval
Amnesty International quoted the report of the 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "work with Facebook networks" and because of the protest against the election results.
"They hit me more often in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in the neck, on the head .... They threatened me with death and they humbled me."
After five days he signed a false consent and was still bloody and half unconscious, released on the street, communicated Amnesty.
The beating Presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demons who were arrested after the election were tortured in August in prison to deaths and were raped to others.
The Iranian authorities denied the rapes, but admitted that misuses took place.
Amnesty also called the case of an former prisoner who said that he was held in a container with 75 other than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognised that the Irish Parliament and the court authorities had established a committee which should examine the disruptions after the election and the reactions of the government to it, but that Amnesty, the mandate and the power of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees were not published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 persons were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was established in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform a true sign in Bristol into a competition piste.
The skiers of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the Hang in the Brandon-Hill-Park, there was a short jump schanze at the beginning of a 100 meters long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful glance from the summit of the Hang, but it was also very intimidating.
It is a great glance with all the lights of the city that glitz below.
He added: "There are some of the best ski riders and snowboarders of the country here - some right talents."
Prices were granted for the best items of art or tricks performed on the Hang.
After the event on Thursday evening the snow is left to smelt.
She and we still.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss elector had voted for a ban on minarette and the concerns about the supposed Islamization of Europe has been widened, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-covered report on whether muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most so-called secularised societies — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French don't love head towels" (Original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006) read, a elegant and dense argumenting study of a question of dispute that shared and occupied the country over a half decades, and their effects are still to be observed today.
Bowens newest book offers a more comprehensive and cool spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now offering the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic Freespaces".
He is a good listener, he gives discussions between teachers and students about the questions they most worry.
Should a muslim marry in a mosque or a council house (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a nonmuslim man?
Is it possible for a Muslim to use a meaning-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
There are these seemingly profant affairs, he claims that the daily life is outset, in contrast to the political drams involved in the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Arab-Muslimian and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have all arguments on their side.
The conservatives are mistrayed with the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thoughts and activists, the Bowen surveyed, are mostly indispensable with their salafi pieces – defenders of purist sunny Islam, who are related to Saudi Arabia – today show a small but influenced presence under Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions how far French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, which so passionately monitors the separation of Church and State) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslime may experience more eclipse treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to make their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
Rather, he recognises a "furthering of valuation" than an increasing pacematism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you tend to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Most Comfortless View of the World
The Arctics change faster and more dramatically than any other environment on earth.
The ice that they know is smiling with alarming speed and taking life with themselves that cann't survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, ship and fishing interests have come into the newest open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their throat water.
Richard Ellis, a author and illustrator, marks in "On thin ice" (Original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icons of the north, the ice bear.
In the complex history and politics of the waling, he describes the long tradition of the Arctician researchers who have proved themselves when hunting the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with an ice bear as a dapper of 14-year-old ferry to the lake, who only fought with the gun of his mosket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught when they swim behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into Zoos and circuss.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears in an idea.
Even today, Zoo facilities still typically have a million set of life of a wildlife. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore became quite green by the algae that grows in the honey hairs of his peel.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often turns back to the threat that the hunters represent the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America, and Russia, the laying in Greenland and Canada continues where hunters in helicopters and motor-sleading Inuit use powerful storm guns to bring their suits to the route.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two huntings the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice" Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the Science Magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arktis and a packaging insight into how the future could develop.
Not at all that scientists have all answers.
No atmosphere scientists or oceanographics can explain the speed of changes appropriately.
But that is not a lack of declaration requests.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century gave the first time the turbulence of the packet.
Under-sea boats in the Cold War, the moving grass during the sub-sea.
A useful supplement is satellite measurements and the large range of measuring sunshines on ice mountains, but many are still reached by unaware people who camp outside the cold.
Anderson brings a glance into the unique, tiny world of the flowing system within the arktic ice formed by salt water drinks, which are coincided in freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice up to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened once the summer ice, which is counted between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... could we be"
Marine-in-fanterists were among the 6,000 who laid down in Arlington Krances
The De'Angello Robinson was traveling seven hours by the bus to put a single cran on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine fantas, who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Peace Court in Arlington, to decorate graves, the day was a tribut to the men and women in whose footsteps they were stepped.
In a few months, from wherever we are always brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish to do someone the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to put bars on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington-Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, holder of the grief producer Worcester Wreath Company in Hać, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Cemetery Court in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who take this trip every year, continues in various cities along the way to perform events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which also expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers lay more than 6,000 crowns on the courts at the Arlington-Friedhof, in areas at the Pentagon, in the graves of the Nationalfriedhof Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and in the memory for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spent for the second time more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she took the trip to Arlington in the memory of her husband, a dead professional record.
Although her husband was not in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to return to the sacrifices.
She said that this is a small contribution to how we can support civilians our soldiers.
It's just like visiting a family graveplace.
Inpacked in locations of warm clothing, the volunteers switched over the extended grass surfaces and hills of the Cemetery courtyard.
The volunteers had elderly graves from the 1st and 2rd war and Vietnam war as a goal, since they were not visited as often as the newest graves, the organizers.
The mood was joyful, children played and couples kept on hand while they carried the fresh cheese branches to the grey stones.
Every round crane was dark green with a small red sleeve that was fastened on the upper part.
The section 60, which is close to and where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 crops to decorate this section, but the worst mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individually wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends held together in the ice - air.
Some read the names in stone, while others were buried down to small black-white space cards that were placed for those in the moisture slaughter, whose tomb stones were not yet finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forgot bitter tears before her son's grave.
She has driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the pitch of Marine Infrastructure Suboffician David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I'm no longer a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Participants of the US government of Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government, who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor who has not yet been identified works for Development Alternatives Inc. with seat in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USID, the US authorities for international development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the United States Interest Office in Havanna try to gain access to the prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The special accusations were not yet published, although, after Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or an foreign visitors can be arrested for almost everything under the accusation of "perhaps".
All so-called conterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, store a arrest risk.
Government hostile graffiti and statements are considered to be a serious crime.
Kuba has a growing blogger community launched by the popular reporter Yoanić, who often describes how they and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
On the other hand, the Commission has repeatedly asked for approval to leave the country to take prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the Castro-Bruder in Cuba and the Obama government, which aimed to improve the relationships with the island.
The recording message was first reported on Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy suggests that the United States will counteract the United States when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average service of a government staff is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are used mainly for sending text messages since a 15-minute phone talk would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and some government sites, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in must often report their names to the government.
Too many websites are limited to access.
On Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting because of crimes such as drug smuggling behind grids, Gloria Berbena said the press speaker of the US interest representative in Havanna.
Berbena said that she couldn't give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and liability are clearly wrong.
A activity that would be legal in any other free society - the free phone deposit - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, which recently produced a hard report on freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, the same Cuba", a record of Raul Castro as leader of the country who replaced the sick elderly brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused were very often arrested, sentenced and arrested within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provoke a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving together for more dialogue.
Pakistanian government representatives deck up plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistann authorities discovered an supposedly leading head of conspiracy on Saturday, who aimed to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill USsoldates, and said that they could hope that this case could help cover an extended network of terrorists seeking the Internet for radicalized young men.
Medians said that they had been looking for an imperfect rebel, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had delivered comment on Terror attacks on the Internet video page YouTube.
Saifullah became the leaders of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah couldn't convince Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA-speaking to immigrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held over days in the east city of Sargodha, far away from the infinite mountains in the northwest, which became a terrorist refugee.
They were considered part of a covered operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government officer who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officer said that the men were not discouraged and still tried to receive the right recommendations to get access to the Al-Kaida campers when they were arrested by the Pakistan criminal authorities.
The case of five men, who are still in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI, underlines the crucial role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in the decision who is trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US Secret Service has made a very urgent matter to submit human activity posts within Al Kaida.
The representatives of the organization act as patrons who do not let those who are not seriously enough for the Holy War and those who could be spoons.
American desirer repruts are subjected to a special test by A Kaida, said analytics.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be a disadvantaged attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, NEFA fundation's highest analytics in the United States, said that terrorist groups were also much more careful in the past years, where they allow access, because the US secret services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to interfere with someone into these groups, what better way could you go than follow the billing model that so many have already followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model now is much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demons demand climate-"Action"
Tens of thousands of demons marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded by the minors in the Bella Congress Centre of the City of Chemical Climate Protection.
Demons said that 100.000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists cast small sprays near some government buildings in the centre of the city.
On one day, when there was little happening in the climate negotiations supported by the UN, thousands of activists with transparently walked through the city on which "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, explaining "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer of Helena Christians, who said that travel to Peru, the birth country of her mother, makes her aware of what devastating problems the country has to fight due to the already sensitive effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration - to continue the word and to appeal to the world leaders, to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not a easy task, but she has to be done now and there is no way around it.
The police stopped the demons from approaching the Bella Centre and said that they had arrested 19 persons, mainly because they were masked or led to bag measuring.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstration.
According to a viewer who did not want to be called, since he is involved in climate negotiations, the demonic demonstration in black clothing has been masked several sprays near the Copenhagen Main Canal, which is close to several ministeries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they began as a lightraket, but then followed by "a few great explosions".
In the inside of the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to reach the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's Chief Climate Dealer.
When he was asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied to English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "I can't hear what happens outside."
He found that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "man can also say that they are disturbing the negotiations or freedom of other people".
Testing data show hardnecked racial air
The testimony on mathematics was welcomed last week for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the district of Washington is still far behind the schools of the country, the highest performances show evidence that the fourth and eight clauses have made faster progress over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the national evaluation of the progress of education (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is the hardnecked performance air between Afro American and white students, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average number of white four-third clauses from Washington D. C. increased from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but only by three points from 209 to 212.
The air performance was actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-clauses remained in principle equal, it fell by a statistically neglectable point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample number was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is not encouraged.
The air, separated by the white and black fourth clause in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that children have reached both groups has grown in this period, the difference with now 58 points has hardly reduced.
Some educational supporters of the distrikt last week expressed their concerns that the results of the school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Adrian M. Fenty, most of the white students, who are already high-performance children, have been celebrated.
This indicates that we have raised the overall evaluation by dealing with those at the upper end of the scale, which is difficult and difficult, Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group entering for education equality in Washington D.C..
I don't jump up and down for a team of two or three points, said the Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the number of testing points is that the city’s central schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs I respect.
But what fears me is that we do not closely turn up the time and energy we need to use for our medium school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of high-performance students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading plan, the Wilson-Lese-System, aimed at students in the upper classes of the basic school and medium-school, which did not master basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school course and relocate the significantly behind their equal classmates.
All day-to-day mathematics, a curriculum that led from the children's garden to the sixth class of games and life-feeding experiences, were brought to Washington under the former governing school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum will be attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work in making the best measures to benefit the students under the level of noise, Rhee said.
Others say that NAEP results highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to improve the system's overall performance and continue to provide additional money and resources for high-performance schools, which are not necessary to reduce the air.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, studying the urban test results.
The conventional medicine is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The aim of this could be to create political follow-ups that work against this important agenda.
The weak point is of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black medium layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts of the city so that all families, independently from where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
This week, Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the air of performance is to extend the traditional public school year currently in Washington 180 days to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, Janey said, who came to agreement with his teacher work last year over 185 days per year, which he considered as a "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future views
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg college with a loud pepper.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises up and blinks a moment in view of the white pillars, the Ziegel stone fassade and the smaragd green rass.
Gracielas parents have hardly completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until shortly, Graciela, who was held in Silver Spring and now lived in Riverdale, never had a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other eight clusters of the group who explore Gettysburg, where teaching costs per year 38.690 dollars, were rather the ones of an enthusiastic visitor than those of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, I'll be here soon!" called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Well, really?" she said thought when she was reported the low professor-to-Student ratio of school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th, which the children visited on their three-day tour, and now they recorded the planned message: The question is not whether to go to the college.
The question is where.
On the other hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of hispanic immigrants who do not stop high school or become pregnant, but on the other hand there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to rise to the medium-sized level.
In fact, one of five of this "two generation" of Hispano Americans concludes the College – what is a remarkable performance, as many of its immigrated parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came into the USA without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they will show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the labor forces of the country.
Those who examine high-performance children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inhabitant drive for success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compete their lack of confidence with American schools.
But advice programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to the College, especially when these efforts continue over a longer period of time.
If you consider income-waaked children whose parents do not have the experience and skills of helping them through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied hispano American students.
We need to consider providing a supporting network from preschool to high school for these children.
The Bundesprogramm, which had financed Gracielas College-Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Turning up a course - and provides over 300 million dollars per year for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when income-waaked students are in the middle school and continue until they have completed high school.
According to the US education department, since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students who have gone more than 60% to the College.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil ends contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns for violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to bring larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two Saturdays.
The 10 contracts completed with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil indicate that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been lamed by war and economic sanctions since decades.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the ten-stage fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that has issued a command has drawn the barrier.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields undergoing in June.
The thin sauced representatives of American oil multitis in opening the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analytics.
After six years of war, Iraq opened his gates and presented the way instead of US companies in Asia and Europe, Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, said an online news service.
There will be no further offer in Iraq for a long time.
Security thinking, which was still underwent by massively coordinated bombing on Tuesday, and the political instability by the deduction of the US military have probably kept American oil companies, so analytics said to engage more in Iraq, who has the third largest proved raw oil reserves in the world.
U.S. companies were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and have more risks because they do not have to comply with shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies who could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US businesses, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who cared for close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, and have been involved with technical advice in recent years.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors of two of the contracts agreed to this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We know all, said the speaker of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the Great of the World Economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure with its partners and meet its obligations to Iraq.
In order to increase the exhaustion of each field beyond the current level, the orders for the order-selected companies were compared to the fee per barel oil which the Ministry was ready to pay.
Top Planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In a clear US-Raket attack along the Pakistan border to Afghanistan, this week, a top-intake planer of Al Kaida was killed, reported representatives of the US-Terrorism Against Friday.
This would be if it would be confirmed that the second deadly attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organisation in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistan authorities, had been killed by a number of missiles who met their vehicle near Miran Shah city in the province of North Wales.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in the unlawful tribe of Pakistan.
They driven in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistan civil secret service from Miran Shah per phone said.
Local people who are suspicious to be part of militants ran to the place and quickly took everything that was left by the "perfectly destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of victims, but two representatives of the US terrorism defected uncertain evidence that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somalia was described as a leading military planner of Al Kaida, which led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies all over the world, observed a governor who wanted to remain anonymous and refers to the healing nature of US air attacks to Pakistan soil.
If one accepts its central role as given, this also includes the planning of attacks against the USA and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and put them into operation plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American representative stated that Somalia had risen quickly in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and maintained best connections to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this does not reduce the danger that he represented for us and our associations.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September as killed in a similar attack to Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The rate of attacks by drones of the CIA has been reduced from an average of six operations per month, according to a summary of Long War Journal, one of a non-profit organizational websites.
The decline may be based on improved terroric groups’ terrorisms, which have taken steps to reduce their adverseness and, at the same time, brutal killing in the suspicious informants, reported the page.
UN Senders will come back to Kabul
On Friday, Kai Eide's leading Messenger of the UNO in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would come back by his office in March, which would end a sturmic office time that was trembled by claims on widespread corruption in the US presidential election supported by the UN.
Own's way is done when the Obama government decided to send further 30.000 U.S. sol data to Afghanistan.
The UN Sender said that he supported the force increase, but he also expressed his concerns that the US timetable for military retreat, which should begin in 18 months, could allow other NATO governments to withdraw their military forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview of Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers that should help in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side must match an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said that he was not putting his office, but only one agreement made by his family against March 2008 to remain in Kabul only two years.
He said he wants the notification to UNO-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Mon now continue so that he has time to ensure a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a follower said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the path of my predecessor and my arrival.
In accordance with UN representatives, Ban started the search for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has led the Swiss-Italy-Samber Staffan di Mimura, who soon led the UN Mission in Bagdad and took into consideration the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has led UN peace operations before.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put on the sample after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to transmit evidence of massive democracy.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who were fired - "have undoubtedly added the mission because of the international interference in the election has already been a great measure of crease".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative to coordinate the aid measures taken by the American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that the UN leadership allowed its successor to provide more staff from the United States and other Western countries that spend for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment on the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the surrounded UN arrangements have undermined its possibilities to bring up capable people.
The UN rules are designed to set only one person since May.
This is catastrophic and should not go on.
US Defense Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers will soon be "developing additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in discussions about its atomic plans.
During a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in the northernirak and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good choices in Iran, he said as a answer to the question of a soldier about the likelihood of such development.
"One of the things that lie on me on the soul is if we have learned something from Iraq over the last six years, which is inevitable to the war."
The Obama government takes into consideration a sanction package aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the averageirans.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to convince the Iranian government that it is in fact less protected with nuclear weapons," because "the people will suffer indifferently" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in a opinion by the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government has joined the European top politicians in the warning that Iran must expect "glaubful" consequences if he does not meet the requirements of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that nuclear technology knowledge should be obtained only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he would resume discussions about the restriction of his nuclear programme and would stop a substantial part of its storage stock in exchange of nuclear fuel needed for his medical research reactor.
The US government has encouraged this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, since this time Iran seems to have left the negotiations to the provisional agreement -- partly, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is indispensable about whether they should engage in the United States.
The international community which the Iran had already agreed to the beginning of October has been openly left, said that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, has brought together in a way as they had never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, has said Gates.
President Obama adopted the 31th of December to respond to these proposals before following other options, including those called Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once "suppressive sanctions".
In an opinion published in New York, the Iranian representation in the United Nations has condemned what it was called "reasonable and unfunded" on Thursday by some security council members to the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue discussions with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqian Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki before he flew to the oily Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The voltages between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, especially in terms of borders, property rights and the division of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential in order to prevent delays of the U.S. plans to reduce the power of the American forces to the end of August of 115.000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to scatter the Kurdish anxiety about the upcoming drop. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who at Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a given Iraq.
We won't leave you."
A change of course in the elderly Chinese
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters who held their lectures that "Mother is too tired to have other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
They have learned these lessons so well that as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course and encourage young couples more than a child, their answer was immediately and final: "In no case."
We have already invested all our time and energy into a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, Wang said 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of renowned, renowned individual children who are lovingly called "little emperor", a population crisis in the country draws up.
The average birth rate has fallen at 1.8 children per couple in comparison to 6 at the time when this policy entered into force, the UN
Region for Population Questions, while the number of populations of 60 years and older in 2020, from 16,7 percent of the population up to 2050 to 31,1 per cent of explosion is going to rise. This is far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The inequality is stronger in rich coastal cities with trained population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai have been exhausted, while the birth rate was below a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning co-mission, said that couples have to get in the proofable age of babies, to help them reduce the proportion of the older populations and to reduce the lack of labour forces in the future.
Shanghai will soon be "so old -- but not as rich -- like the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A progressive relaxation
In the constitution of the country in 1978, China's single-chind policy is likely to be the most controversial available that has been introduced by the magnificent Communist Party until today.
Marriage couples who violate this policy must expect enormous penalties -- to their three-fold annual content in some regions -- and discrimination at their job.
Chinese government representatives have attributed this policy that the critical demand for natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives condemned abuses in enforcement of policies.
In rural regions, some officials who had already had a child forced to drive off.
Many couples also had made sex-like abortions, creating an insurprising high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for population have gradually deteriorated their attitude to one-kind policy.
In 2004 they allowed more exceptions of the rule -- including city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the sound of many hard slogans was milled.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Peking, said that government representatives had even discussed over more radical changes, for example allowing couples of two children to be a single friend.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July, which started a aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Pastes who taught families only have a child were replaced by directives nearly night, the detailed description of who comes into question for a second child and how to apply the approval.
The city administration has sent urban staff and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and move through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for a psychological and financial advice to provide more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outer areas of Shanghai said that a growth in the applications of couples is to be recognized that after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with an inhabitant number of 115.000, the example is still only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai's officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city despite the campaign will still be approximately 165.000 -- something higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have more children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that she would like two children and would be legally allowed.
But they have, as many Chineses, only a low health insurance and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would not be responsible.
People in the West rated the one-kind policy falsely as a human rights question, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, we get rid of the possibility of having more than one child.
However, the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their cessation.
Wang, the staff leader, said she wants only to be a child because she was also a single boy. "We were the center of the family and lived that everyone was concerned with us.
We are not pleased to take care of others and do not really want this."
Chen Sideian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it inevitable.
For parents from the middle stand with double accessibility that reduces the birth rate, he said, turns it to be successful and for this one must be self-experienced.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they would not want a life for themselves, he said.
A single child, he said, also sets enormous requirements for the time of parents.
A mother has to give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You must rebuild his apartment" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must have paraded a course of life for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are ready to get through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of life, he said.
We don't want to bring too many sacrifices.
UN Group designs Emission Reduction Plan
The climate conference promoted by the UN – which is now characterized by wild positions and mutual accusations – has again set a focus on Friday with the publication of a document, which has to draw up an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, while industrial developments have to set up the largest loads in the near future.
The text which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases has shown the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was regarded as an important progress in a negotiations that is going out of time because more than 100 leading politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text formed by a UN working group ownly for this purpose is shaken by the amount of money that should give rich countries to the poor countries so that this can prevail global warming in a short and long term.
It also offers a palette of options for key questions, including industrial and large threshold countries to limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit value of global temperature increase would be that of political decision-makers.
The process will give a great flexibility, says John Coequyt, leader of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the six-sided document, has compiled an 180-page negotiation text in order to focus on what is called the leading UN, Yvo de Boer, as "the great whole".
It shows the basic risk of a possible agreement, whereby industrial nations jointly would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
At the same time, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent.
The European Community has also given the discussions on Friday through its guarantee to provide 3,6 billion US dollars per year to support poorer countries to adapt the impact of climate change, from the master of floods and droughts to prevent deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that had decided the conversations in the last week.
The American Climate Unit Representative Todd Star has rejected formulations, demanding binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger countries, if they are not financed by industrial organisations.
This train announced that the Obama government drives a harder line with China as representative of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign agreements without having greater threshold countries and take action, so star who also complained that the text is not far enough to ensure that the reductions could be confirmed by foreigners.
Star gave his opinion one hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice-President He Yafei, who stated that it was either lacking "people" or it was "mainly unreasonable" from him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to control global warming.
The future economic marches of the major world powers have opened break-lines within the industrial nations, as well as between industrial and threshold countries.
The current fight also refers to the rescue of individual economies, as well as the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States engaged in their obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozens of influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for those who should carry the costs for the braking of the greenhouse gas exhaust, as even affected countries have taken action aggressively in order to take countries with very high greenhouse gas tax for their actions to account.
It is clear that this is a game that will develop a new economic predominance, Ulate, who is also active as a regional climate consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some countries who are most suspended to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding Treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the discussions will best lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented an 24-page contract design on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who guides international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the openness of the small island states is "political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and call for measures from the countries of thresholds such as China and India.
The discussions received a new urgency when the delegated focused on the fact that most open questions still have to be clarified before the government leaders arrived in order to agree.
High-level representatives, as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice Minister escaped their planes and rose by the bendings of Bella centers at meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stop Claims that are negotiated during the next week.
The pure size of the congregation -- 13.000 people are entering and selling in the Congress Centre daily, gitarre activists in the night shows, in which they make fun about the countries who feel that they are betraying and selling, and contract designs are hand-handed instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just that almost all important ministers will be here and since Wednesday 60 leaders of the government in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President of Global Policy of the Organisation Conservation International.
The hardweights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train defines Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13, a pepper will pass through the darkness to announce an assignment that represents a revolution in the transportation of Britain.
The first high-speed train in the country will reach 225 km/h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
At Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then be committing on board the first Javelin Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new service of Britain will be closely linked to an international rail network, faster, reliable trains, and the large balling areas of Midland, the north and Scotland will be connected to London.
The neglected province could become lively pendler cities, working time would be radically reduced, and the exchange of aircraft and car to railway would reduce national carbon emissions and the stroll to the streets.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network, the unavoidable planning slaughter and fears of environmental damage could still move the brakes in the British high-speed glasses.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a validity study by the government, Lord Adonis will report on 30 December, according to the Times.
This means that it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London to West Midlands will pass with a space of five meters in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment is encircled.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 should also create three options for a larger, northward leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred suggestion is an Y-shaped route in which a single high-speed track would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be shared in or near Birmingham and a distant would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway insider.
After the completion, the travel period between London and Edinburgh would reduce 40 minutes to 2 hours.
The first subtract that would not be opened before 2025 would allow the travelers to re-establish the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with something over an hour today.
The designs made the trains the opportunity to drive with a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest of Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters can drive on it with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation on the London-Birmingham route.
This would mean that in London a final station would be necessary on which 200,000 travelers could be completed per hour.
Given the spacious limitations in the capital, an existing railway station would be extended to cover the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will state whether this plan should be continued or not, but the long-term public advice and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken after Parliament elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains should first change from the high speed tracks to existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be over three hours between London and Scotland.
This is considered to be a decisive point in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the railway, a level of direction for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers arise for mortgage for 75,000 pound orangery of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading subhouse member of the conservatives, has taken into account thousands of pounds per year for the costs of an orangery that he read in his house in his election circle.
The prison speaker of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron because he accused that under-house members must live "from magnificent Rationen", increased his hypothecs by 75,000 pounds to build an oak wood-working plant at his twin home in Rutland.
He allowed the taxpayer to take into account the additional interest increase, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The responsibilities of the subhouse have then approved the applications and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas, who conducted a review of the expenditure of the sub-house members. Last night, Duncan said that the applications could be "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest subhouse members, has a two-stage house in a village in its election district Rutland and Melton.
In the vicinity of homes, a purchase price of almost one million pound (1.1 million euros) has reached.
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, a expenditure control point of the subhouse, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he has built a winter garden called "range" in the plans.
neighbours described him as a "Glashaus for Entertainment".
Duncan has not also been invited during a recent examination of its previous hypothecrisy agreements by the Committee on Standards and Privilegia to take place in order to increase the amount of money.
The Committee has released it last month after an examination of its expenditure from the breakdown of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage over 271.406 pound (300.000 euros) from his London House to his election home, which he had bought 1991, a year before his election to the Member of Parliament.
This week, documents published, show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as hypothecense.
In April, its claims increased to more than EUR 1,800 pounds (2,000) per month.
Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase in the financing of the money consumption of EUR 75,000.
The normal levelless RBS mortgage rate decreased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March of this year, where he still stands.
The latest documents published by the subhouse show that Duncan continued to apply its right to 1.250 pounds (1.400 Euros) per month in this May.
Duncan lost his post as the opposition leader of the Subhaus in September, after a Undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the expenditure channel that Parliament members would live by magnificent Rations.
"Objectively, it means to work for the State that you must live by magnificent Rations and be treated as S***".
He said, "I have spent my money for my garden and claimed to a lost small part, measured in what is heard.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't do it."
The Member of Parliament, millionary from his former career as an oil dealer, was attacked for the first time in May, when it became clear that he had invited thousands of pounds for his garden before he had cleared the Fees Office that this could be considered "as excessive demand".
A activist buryed a hole in the form of a pound sign as a protest in Duncans Rasen after it was known that he had invited 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was asked about the increased mortgage yesterday night, Duncan said: "This was both the Fees Office, and the following was approved by deposit to increase value."
He added: "There is no debate about relapses and slides or a verbal of rules or similar.
Everything is perfectly perceived and is strictly moving within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer at all."
If all their believers come to admire Brightons beach house advent calendar
Beach houses in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries by creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a topic.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to see the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free glue wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruits.
The Christmas songs are "I saw three ships," "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a predominant clergyman of the Chichester diocesese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect as a church from the people to come into an strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Star mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated globally on Saturday and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate warming where the police took several hundreds of arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to police, hundred thousand, according to the organizers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world contributes to the highlighting of these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital found short time after the train passed when a group of 300 demons clothed entirely in black, shooting windows with plaster stones and hemmers, a journalist of the AFP established.
Anti-Unruhe police have attacked immediately and without consideration.
The police stated that 600 to 700 people, according to your esteem, have been arrested in the east of France, in April, according to "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the demonstrators, has been criticized by the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers were arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that about a hundred of you were "more held in the streets on Saturday evening" despite the extreme cold with hands and insitz position.
The more peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The demons have stopped some 500 meters away from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed in order to welcome the planned speaker with cherry lights for an evening, with participating the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demons are traveled with bushes and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue rainmäntels, have made a first rising in Copenhagen in the morning, as you followed the call of the earth's friends," blue times for the "Klimajustiz".
Today we go on the streets to demand a reimbursement of ecological guilt for the south, Lidy Nacpil, filippinic activist of the anniversary South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on and say: we have time, Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry, water courses you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomation, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation criteria has approached the environmental organisations.
The Europe-oriented José Bové, the form of globalization criticism, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Clafed Justice and Social Justice": "There are no differences between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pazific area, where many islands are particularly threatened due to warming, has given the initial shot for demonstrations.
Approximately 500,000 people have gone to the streets according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila there were some hundreds of people, most of the students who are marched in red and hated bandanas in which you roasted solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, there were some hundred demonstrators taking place in order to demand an energic approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network have gathered some hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (South), in Lille (Nord), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
In Geneva, some people gathered together.
The separateist Abchasia has chosen his president, Georgia denounced that it is a "strip" here.
Abchasien chose his president on Saturday, this happened a bit more than one year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separation territory as self-evident, deuncated Tbilissi the "Streich".
About 13,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Gorgean War of August 2008 for control over the South East Sea, a further Georgian secessionist area recognised by Russia.

These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abchasien is now totally occupied, has explained his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have acknowledged the self-equivalence of this area with 21,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world has seen it as a part of Georgia, thatillegly is occupied by Russia.
After the conflict was separated from Georgia during 1992 - 1993, with several thousands of people died, Abchasia would like to prove by this choice that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have chosen to master Bagapch.
She was one of the choosings that were chosen to a election place in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms before the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.

We, the periodicals people, are grateful, he said at a little celebration, as an indication of the support of Moscow, in particular on the decision to acknowledge Abchasien's self-equivalence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament and has collected a glass of Wodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by the former Vice President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements taken with Moscow in the previous year, as the one in which Abchasia leaves the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the present government or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one voice is necessary to win the choice.
If none of the candidates reach this limit value, a second round of election must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Intervals in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated every Saturday in the world to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the headenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time, took some 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thousands of people, according to police, hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon schools in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train took place towards the Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The demons have stopped some 500 meters away from the center and did not try to impose.
A stage was built to welcome the planned speaker with cherry lights, with participating the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of demons that were all dressed in black and armed with backstones and with hembles began to put shoes one, a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-Unruhe police have turned in immediately and infringed without prejudice by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 persons were arrested and have cleared that it is mainly members of the Black Bloc, these extreme violent splitter groups, which have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
By evening, a police officer suffered a injured in the intermediary during which, according to police, about 20 persons were arrested provisionally, infringed by a plaster stone. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in the handle," said Henrik Jakobsen, who created helicopters of the order forces in the air.
Most of the demons, who traveled from London, Amsterdam or Milan by train or with their own vehicle, were Europeans.
There were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the blue rain basket, were formed in Copenhagen in the morning after calling the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "Clafigness".
"Today we go to the street to demand that environmental debts are paid back to the people of the south," said the activist Lidy Nacpil of the anniversary South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say that we have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that decay, there are water courses through which you can run what was never the case."
The first time in the history of climate diplomation, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the entrepreneurs of globalisation has approached the environmental organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and Globalization Critician José Bové, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to connect "climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer a difference between the fight against warming and fighting for another world today."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model of Helena Christiansen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asian-Pazific area, where many islands are particularly vulnerable for warming, has given the incentive for demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the words of the organizers, about 50.000 people have gone to the street.
In Manila some hundreds of students, in the multitude of students, dressed red with bandanas, before the city administration of the Philippian capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered themselves in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the West and Lyon in the east, joined by the "Netz of 350" demonstrations.
In Geneva, several people gathered together.
The facial geography and history, according to Chatel, are strengthened by the school reform of Lycéen.
The national education minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the facts of geography and history are strengthened by the training reform of Lycés, even if they are not compulsoryly informed in the terminals (12th school year).
"The teachers of the Première (11th school year) now have every four weeks and the same programme," confirmed Mr. Chatel.
For the minister "must be overcome this hypocrisy," because after him, "the scientific profile is no more scientific profile", but in the Great and Whole, a concentration "the best students".
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of the scientific," he continued. He underlined: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have embraced technical songs about the lack of historical geographic education in the terminals."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité revealed that almost seven of ten French (69%) criticize the state project of the scattering of compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminals S (12. School year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also encountered this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
On the other hand, the Minister replied that there was no question regarding the limitation of the philosophy of the terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of education for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) had called for protest against the project, which, according to the pedagogic training of future teachers, is victims.
At the beginning of the year, the Minister found that it conducted the master 2 (M2) of a professional appliance test and at the end of the year of an authorisation test, which is tested for their teaching capabilities.
They also carry out practices during the year in the M2 and then teach a year before the students as a teacher in the practice.
He still said: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach more hours you have spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister explained that he wishes to offer "individual right to education" - a "sack that does not exist in the people's education."
He again confirmed that he would like to create the school map "to 2012".
15 minutes for climate at the "Ecole Normal Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the International Panel on Climate Change, had to deal with the Ecole Normal Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the peace nobel prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, with which experts each were 15 minutes with filmed contributions to the audience.
You want to do something to reach people and wake up in them to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years and one of the organizers of this day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students have given fish in the Bassin of the school.
"The experts have been selected for the 20 participants, even after their charism," he explains.
"To the warming of climates you can talk for hours. However, the core targets can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, which about 50 people speaked freely with the help of diamonds.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the listeners may take the view that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos rotated by these conferences will be found online from December 15 on the school side.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will take place every two months.
Payment delay : angry prisoner, actions planned
On Friday, the trade unions of the prison officers called for a general day of action to achieve the transfer of the premiums and hours whose payment was suspended from budget reasons to January before the Christmas celebrations.
The 2nd trade union of prison officials ("FO-Pénitentiary") called on the employees who do not have a service to demonstrate on Tuesday morning before the prison event and block them to pay attention to the 'debt of what is available'.
The 3rd trade union of prison officials ("CGT-Pénitentiary") called on "to unite strong mobilization in the different prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtime hours, night supplements, and the sun and celebrations will be burned as "shameful and inadequate" market in December.
The first trade union of the criminal officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Organization Union (UFAP/UNSA), called on "general mobilizations (...) to show the unreasonableness and the wrath."
The management of the penalty organizer and the Ministry of Justice declared that the overtimes in 2009 have risen strongly and not all provided in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims are paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice told the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of the criminal officers in which the payment is guaranteed to take place in the next month.
"I am very well aware of the efforts of the staff to keep and modernize our criminal proceedings system functionally," the Minister of Justice tells us in this letter.
"I have indicated the leadership of the criminal proceedings to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has failed to take over hours, has not been repeated in the future," said Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December wage falls mager, except for the management person that comes into the high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "sustainability" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional FO union in Marseille embraces and announced to "cott all congregations and appeals" until new instructions.
"The staff do not go on work on sun and holidays, unless the hours from October in December are still not paid. That is also true for their hours," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time, as more and more tasks are paid to us without setting more staff, the attempt is to extend to the funds of the staff more than inappropriate," says the CGT community of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is injustice, founded by the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.

Euro-2009/shortway: first place for Bousquet via its favorite dish
The Franzose Frédérick Bousquet, three-fold medal winner at the swimming worldmeisterschaften in 2009, took an international title on its favourite dance, 50m free style, with the Euro-2009 shortway in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethanes were allowed last time, there were only three world records while a true record flow was expected.
A record has been improved by Hungary Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m locations and the two others by Russia at 4 x 50m positions of men.
Schade for Bousquet, who wanted to take the 50m free style after the world record, whose record he holds in the great basket (20.94).
The 28-year-old Franzose claimed in 20, 53 sec, in a final with ten swimers at the start (in the rule there are eight) – a prize at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganya (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not create it to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater, and in this case I said when the world record is in my reach, I will try it."
As Bousquet started almost all swimming forces in polyurethane traits prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 World Records since February 2008, these combinations end their epos in Istanbul, which began the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination has not been paid at the end of this summer in Rome and World Record for the German Paul Biedermann, two-fold World Championshiper in Becken.
The young swimming pool has not been able to improve his best time more than 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has spent himself with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew that I can't reach a world record today, but I have defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Grabplatte at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
An Roman grave plate, which was recorded with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be 1.5 million US dollar over its value on Thursday, says the artist Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It is from the III. century to Christ and has always been rated with 1500,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The Marmor, on which "four scenes of Dionysos are represented in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by Satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explains Florent Heintz, Vice President for enlargement of Roman and Egyptian antiques in Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers have been most commanded for until now," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy against the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part through Emile Zola goes far back.
The plate was nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the family of Borghese, and then she added pieces for pieces at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her bathroom of her Paris hotel for this purpose and at Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III. French Republic and President of the Council, before Marschall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching for the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "Erbes of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Térèse Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelayas Trip from Honduras direction of Mexico has been defeated
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the dogure president Manuel Zelaya on the homeland as no longer agreed after the suspension of the Putsch government had refused to be inappropriate.
After a phone talk with President Zelaya took place in the night, everything seems to be inconsistency with regard to the possibilities for carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft placed by the Mexican government was returned to its destination on Wednesday in Salvador for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas.
The Putsch government wanted to need M. Zelaya for a "declaration" and for political asylum in the abroad.
However, the President-in-Office refused this because he wanted to return to Mexico as a greeter to the head of the State.
The Putsch regime "hat suffered a remedy of error by moving up to my costs (...), they wanted me to remember," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has been reporting often to the word since the beginning of the political crisis that is already in the Central American country.
I can stay here and like to 10 years, here I have my guitar, added the crashed President, who had fled into the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the attacks of some agreements.
The Mexican Embassy presented us a request for passion, but we are unfortunately unable to accept asylum, as it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, inside minister of the Putsch government, had explained to the dogurean radio HRN.
I'm not looking for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible trip from Honduras, so he had underlined, would merely take place as President of the doguran people.
The rumours for a trip to M. Zelayas had mobilised the followers of the crashed president, who had made up to the Brazilian message and had gathered around these on Wednesday, where the military had strengthened its use there.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch government.
This, according to its assessment, revealed the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venetian President Hugo Chavez, was crashed on 28 June, on the day of the national survey organised by him to prepare his re-election against the Council of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he was surprisingly returned on 21 September and had fled into the Brazilian message.
He leaves this, he will be arrested for Hochverrats, which he is accused by the justice, the Putsch government.
The Putsch president Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to dissolve M. Zelaya.
In the course of the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was recognised by the United States, however, from Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argeninien or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelayas return to the office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.

Some hundreds of parties, on the Cuban power of Thursday, have spoiled together in Havanna for the purposes of the World Human Rights Day and also refined another communion because of which a good dozen dissident was temporarily arrested.
A journalist of the AFP confirmed about the 40 "Damen in Weiss", wives or Nahestehende political prisoners, on the open street of the government's participants under Raul Castro, when they were in the center of the Haupstadt, to demand the liberation of the political prisoners.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!" "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!" "It lives fidel and raul!", the powered particians with collected Faust scanned the dissidents.

The temporary arrest of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As an advocate on the sacharov prices granted by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Damen in Wiss" has organized a non-approval of the "Please for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the list of dissidents, Laura Pollan explained, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda sets a sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 in March 2003 arrested Cuban dissidents, from which to date 53 are behind grids.
The Cuban authorities feel the regimens as "söldners" or "suppliers" in the service of the exhibited arch enemy, the United States.
A rarity is that Cuban television reported about the demonstration events found on Thursday between militant pro-governmental campaigns and "contra-revolutionary".
Cuba, led by a unit party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of the immigration of rights and freedoms, especially those of freedom of opinion.

U.S.: Polanskis Advocate again calls for discrimination
The lawyer of the French-polish filmmaker Roman Polanski asked for a repeated time on Thursday in Los Angeles (Kalifornia, Western United States) to leave the prosecution against his clients who are currently at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral distortion of more than 30 years before the court.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist" has advoked to three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California in the negotiation period in 1977.
I demand in the place of criminal law, said M. Hummel before he added that the behavior of the judge Laurence Rittenband was "a cold run down the back" at the time of negotiation.
The judge Rittenband, before he fell his judge's claim, discussed with a lawyer who said to him, Roman Polanski has deserved Zuchthaus -- which represents a grave process error.
This discussion was launched in the documentary "Roman Polanski: desired and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), owned by the questionnant of David Wells.
M. Wells had finally explained to have the authors of the documentary "belogen" at the end of September.
If the Court refuses to introduce the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands the lead of a process that would allow him to provide evidence for its argumentation.
On the other hand, the claim has repeated the evidence stated in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the withdrawal of the accused acts cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before court.
The 76-year-old director had fled 1978 from the U.S. and still before the publishing of the criminal measure because of "illegaal sexual relations" with a underlying 13-year-old.
He hasn't been traveling into the United States since that time.
The deputy state lawyer of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski must be "to attend the negotiation".
Would you like to distribute the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused ones who escape is a way out?, Mrs Asayma asks.
"The filmmaker, according to their opinion, put the Court of Justice in favour of his authority."
One of the three judges – which now have 90 days of time to declare their decision – even highlighted, "that it would still be other curiosms."
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the attitude of punishment against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the withdrawal of the criminal procedure again.
She reminded that her client would no longer endure it to be harmed by any reliability of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one can say in this room that this procedure was justified.
Two and thirty years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland, on the occasion of an American prison order.
After spending two months behind the grids, he was then sentenced to the arrest of his chalet in Gstaad in the expectation of a possible delivery.
Wall Street is breached by the rise in the dollar and quit without course.
The New York stock exchange ended on Friday without course in a market that was reduced between better indicators than in the United States and an increase in dollars: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available for the closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased to 10.471.50 points, while the technically dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended index standard & poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Really, the market is quite quiet," said Mace looksilver by Marblehead Asset Management.
"He remains closely limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned to help "promote market views to improve the solidity of the economy," together with the analytics of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, sales in retail increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months behind each other and far more than planned.
In addition, the confidence of the American consumers has significantly improved in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes were breached by a new increase in the dollar course, which has reached the highest level compared to the euro for two months and 'the economic situation is pressed down'," said Owen Fitzpatrick, German Bank.
The technological values have lost something on the ground.
The obligation market has declined.
The estimated loan rate over 10 years has increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and the amount of loans over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month tour through South Africa, 112 candidates to the title of Miss World will be overseased on Saturday to achieve their dream: the most beautiful woman in the world will be chosen and to watch this before a billion television.
During this great beauty measuring, which is organised for the second time in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already enticed their ticket to the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were shortened through their African stay to Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model.
This was a true strike of pleasures.
Beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, were simply exceptional.
I saw many things and made every lot of experience!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place in South Africa for the ninth time and will be transferred live on Saturday at 17 p.m. from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a nicer country to pass my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underscored Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russians, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "atmovating landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, encounters with the press and Safari, Miss now focuses on competition.
The Inderin Pooja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was chosen in 2000 and will also be present in this choice, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was chosen in 1994 and were both Bollywoodstars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the look here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the Krone, and Miss India injects with a wide smile.
According to the organizer, this 59th edition with music and dance will be underlined.
The candidates defence in traditional trucks and not to forget, in the bathing attraction.
The idea is presented by a TV moderator, the Chinesin Angela Chow, by the Ex-Security king from South Africa, Michelle McLean and by a representative of the Miss World Commission, Steve Connors.
South Africa has shown that it is the world with a hardly excessive warmth and pride to receive, assured Julia Morley, chairman of the Miss World.
As last year, the candidates have made a Safari visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time the bicycle and the local cuisine cost.
However, the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand.
Unusual for a state leader, Miss Sierra Leone noticed.
Their most beautiful reminder, however, remains undoubtedly the release in Cape Town (Southwest) to the Football World Championship in June 2010, a kind of country, to acquire something more for this event.
I'm wrong with people that I'm probably never able to approach myself elsewhere.
I will come back to the World Championship 2010, promised excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news to Johnny Hallyday are "right positive" according to his son David
The news to Johnny Hallyday are "about positive," his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news are very positive.
He's very strong, it's very good, David Hallyday explained the press when he exited from the plane where he came from Paris shortly after 13 p.m.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would give himself "fast" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, in which Johnny Hallyday was delivered in Paris on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation on 26 November.
The singer was "moved this night in Los Angeles into a artificial coma to reduce his strong pain and to perform his treatment, announced the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was put into a artificial coma by the doctors of Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was delivered in Paris on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection after a band disk operation on 26 November.
The singer had to re-establish a surgery during the night of Wednesday on Thursday due to the last changes of sickness.
His wife Laeticia participated in a school event in Los Angeles's French Gymnasium, where her daughter Jade went to school on Friday morning, a photographer of the AFP.
The head of the department for orthopädic and traumatic surgery at the Hôpital Pité-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on 26 November in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us that he had set up the pureest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said that they were completely disrupted, Mr. Camus explained.
I heard that you may be going to institute a court procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "is far too fast and traveled with the permission of Paris's surgery to Los Angeles".
I personally phoned with this doctor, who assured me that he sees this journey as quite unrelated, what had been very surprised to me, since I have already added two tapes operations behind me.
Shortly before he announced to RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the area of artists.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Sein, in which he practiced at that time.
He also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg in 2007 to resorb a hematom after a brain blood.
But he is also a doctor with doubtful reputation, who has been condemned several times because of infected operations and not to forget because of tax impairment and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Chamber of Doctors, described him as a "a man without a skrupel" who has "regular" before the Board of State and "all other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave an explanation about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This explained that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would be "normal".
The operation "does not show blood and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been in question since last summer.
It is clear that it is too small for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amias), Mr Camus stated.
The UDF Party Association (Union for French Democracy) will become energic and call on the Nouveau Party to no longer use its seal
On Friday, the party bond, monitored by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, has responded to an inception of the seal, which once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the president of Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and asked him under the threat of a judicial persecution to use this seal to no more document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take this UDF seal because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had reached the links.
The Defense Minister, whose party partner is the UMP, was about to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of NC.
In order to impress his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now with NC), who acquired a claim to the property of the UDF brand, as he first requested this brand in 2004 to the Institute of National de la proprété Industrial.
However, the business office of the UDF’s friend supervised party bonds of the UDF broke the silence and gave it clear to understand that they did not dispose and set a period of time to no longer use this seal and to transfer the ownership of the brand.
In the last days you have issued numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement to take the UDF Seal +, the party bond wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, and the Senator Jean Arthouse of the Centrist Association.
They probably believed that you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the Slogan + today's UDF +, on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, the business office of the UDF stated and calls on the NC party to "repeal the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (her) website".
In addition, it was required by Hervé de Charette to transfer property rights of the brand to their legal rights."
If you refuse this, we will raise complaint against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signers warned.
In her letter, they stressed that "UDF" is a full political movement in 1978 and remember that Morin and his friends "have taken the choice" to leave this in 2007 to establish a competing movement, as it had already done other than 2002 to establish the "UMP" party.
Therefore, the Nouveau Centre has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to remember that the last Convention of the UDF in 2007 adopted the three-year-old accession to the MoDem party and the establishment of a business office for the defense of the 'material and moral interests' of the movement established by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
What Hervé de Charette is concerned, the business office continues, "was at the time when he requested the brand name, not any member of the UDF for three years" but the UMP.
He benefits in a skandalous and misleading way, from the lack of the deposit of the Akronym UDF, to perform this for himself.
In addition, consider that this unrespectfulness is best to change into a crime, and ironize the NC strategy: "It seems us in politics as well as in life more would be more likely to make yourself a name instead of trying to get out of anonymousity, by taking up a name in deceitious ways that you have no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is sentenced for the exploitation of weaknesses
On Friday the Court of Justice of Nanterre has decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he claimed to use a weak moment of the eighties to get a part of their assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, which is known for his Star Photographs, will have to be responsible for the exploitation of weaknesses in courts on 15 and 16 April 2010, a penalty which is committed to a sentence of a freedom of a maximum of three years and a fine penalty of 37,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair, which is worthy of Saga of one of the most rich families of France, where mother and daughter are fed and at the same time the tractors of the cosmeticimperium L'Oréal have in hand.
However, the 15th penalty chamber addressed a medical examination of the 87-year-old liliane bedencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's crew and primary activist has previously refused to examine such an investigation, especially not under the conditions submitted during the investigations submitted by Nanterre State prosecutor.
The Friday-appointed doctors are supposed to submit a report before 10 March 2010, in which you clearly know whether and at which times Liliane Bedencourt may have found itself in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these studies.
I'm going to talk to her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after negotiation.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the court decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The advice will prove that he (Banyer) manipulated this old lady, which you need to protect, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has launched a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artists, and accused him to have used the weakness of her mother for years to shake violations of a billion euro in the form of bank checks, insurance policy or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always been contradicted to be manipulated by the photographer, who she looks like a long-standing friend.
Although the court should examine the reliability of the complaint initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaidoyers of the lawyers on Friday led to a large family decay.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's advocate to three of his clients sent letters to their notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she was wrong with the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bedencourt added: "Please explain my daughter that I wrote to banier for 15 years, one to two times a day.
Françoise has never been able to talk again since their marriage.”
The prosecutor of Nanterre again believes that the applicant had no right to respond in this way, especially because a presidency judge has rejected its application in recent days to introduce a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bedencourt "is fully legally capable, is not under protection and has no mum.
No one has the right to act in its place," confirmed the representative of the state lawyer Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to make a judgment after the process of reliability of Mme Bedencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of Strategic Early Declaration?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been less ...
Since over a decade, the position of the administration of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It has been involved in the staff "values" determines the best as it was previously designed to depend on the consumer products by the technicians in the workplace.
By your customers in the focus of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies for the acquisition of markets locally ... although the autoritary temptation of products separated factors preferences of customers regularly depends on them!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to a deadly democracy.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the top of a much larger phenomenon, especially the employees.
This demobilisation affects the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of F&Eand, more crucial, to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) calls on "all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a future-oriented way of view" by the employees to take advantage of the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we call for an operational revolution, which would exist in the mid-point of the company's concerns equally next to the customers.
The very related benefit of internal opinion issues
Will the internal opinion questions, as the questionnaire, the Orange has submitted its beneficiaries, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid I don't.
- Firstly, because I could find that the whole plant, given a new situation in many ways, came to do priority to what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologys of the power proportional increases in the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
From the big engineering schools, her interpretation of psychology is mechanically.
They take through intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory that has recently been reactived by the US-American "new sciences" and unconsciously widened by research institutions and media.
Thus and by suggesting that Ipsos’ survey is possible to operate the "Hebel" (sic) for the commitment of employees, a current le Figaro.fr survey released by Ipsos strengthens the leaders in a position on a mechanistic control system that is unequivocal for today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern firms requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol in any conviction or practice of control: for the beneficiaries, the commitment for the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve part of its dreams, its ambition and its projects.
At present, studies from multifunctional analysis take the conception of motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their companies on the basis of a prescribed doxa that allows them to be assessed by their perceived image of the company, which offers them to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the management forces of the companies can control their "social performance", predict and preliminate and reset their human resource management at the right place.
They thus create a fertile soil which is beneficial for the agreed development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: The "righteous war" brings Obama Lob from right
On Friday, the American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama at the preliminary in Oslo and were satisfied that the Nobel Prize of Peace in 2009 defended the term "righteous war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had spotted the allocation of the price to Obama on 9 October appealed this time to the President's speech, the example of the former Vice-President's Candidatin in the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained the right wing of the Republican Party's right flying in the daily newspaper USA Today and added that she himself brought the topic of a "manual necessary" war into their same memorials.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do it, but he is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars by his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday; a way to explain his decision from nine days ago to dismiss 30.000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the president had done "hier good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the representative house, who recognized particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, this speech was fully funded as a historical, Ginrich explained, who was consulted in the "The Takeaway" radio broadcast.
The former Member who is viewed by some as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidency election in 2012, said that he was pleased to have seen a "president of the links", who reminded the members of the Nobel Commission that they were "not free and could not have a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to being a "Kosmopolitan" as "who always makes it," he said "like an American president," when he pointed out that the Europeans live "like a security blast that they have not created themselves and do not much for their protection", says Gerson.
Under the few, not convinced rights, the former UNO bomber John Bolton, a Falke of the Era Bush, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "slow, high-speed evening and inspirationsless".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is worried about how Barack Obama defends the refusal to the army forces.
If you pack the war under the deck of justice, the massacre can easily be justified to the innocents, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate links remains lobing on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still the view that the Nobel Prize was forgaved to Obama, described the speech itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "monumental work".
The speech in Oslo "is an expiry plan for controlling international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," said the kalifornian daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama declared "the necessary discourage" and describes his speech as "delicate and exemplary at the same time".
Fernfahrer: Three Marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply of Christmas
After a three-week marathon negotiation, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening which ends the strike command and the threatening heavy supply pass to Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening the State Secretary of State Dominique Bussereau, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several negotiations week.
After a second hearing night, the negotiators divorced quickly on the early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement on the late morning.
And that although the three employers associations (FNTR, Unostr and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting took place at 11:00 a.m. until the end of the agreement and the agreement was signed at 18:00 p.m.
The conflict "has much damage added to the company" and "it was to fear that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Busserau.
The Agreement provides for an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hour rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from EUR 8.72 to € 9.06.
"It's not particularly much, but we're just starting small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now assigned not to block the supply centres.
"There will probably always be some contradictions that are not satisfied with the agreement," he supplements.
The TLF President-in-Office of Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "swift to introduce these wage increases in view of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros monthly for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on healthy human understanding and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for the increase in travel costs by 3 % and the maintenance of the total operation for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, enable the subject of 13 month content and modernisation of the contracts.
M. Bussereau reminded that "sincing the taxes for employers at the height of 100 million euros" was the subject of a amendment from the government to the draft law of corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly at night from Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for a identical vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be applied first to the undertakings attached to this organization and then, in the event of an extension by the Minister for Labour Affairs, shall apply for the entire occupational status.
This will be "in shortest time", assures Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only go beyond the procedure.
The FNTR association prescribed a "deceitful trade", because the 100 million euros "were promised to compensate the sector for a part of the carbon taxes already".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to destroy the Gans essers in the nearest Christmas days, the Unostr besewers.
For the Otre Association, the agreement "when the small and medium-sized enterprise of the industry is threatening a large grave in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Distortions this weekend, unreasonable trade unions with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest highway network in France for the Great Area of Paris and the Edmontonle-de-France, continued during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd strike day between the trade unions and the RATP (dependenced Paris's personnel management), allowing strikes to be waited for wage allowances.
At this important weekend before Christmas, there was no trains between 10:00 and 20:00 pm. At the central tram (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central tram was only one of four trains prepared.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfectures, which forced the travelers to move.
The Kaufhauskette Galeries Lafayette, which is every day 200.000 customers, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the large businesses technically."
The RER A line passes the Paris Balling Area from West to East.
The RATP route section connects the places of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two move to the main time of transport was planned, and almost no one during the poor time of transport.
As already on Thursday, there was no human habitat on the train, since the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had set up the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less exceeded than otherwise, especially because of the lack of gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he would be extra "one and a half hours earlier stood up to get to work".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide for the travelers by staff and order forces, indicated that there was no Engpässen in Saint-Lazare railway station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or towards Cergy-Le-Haut came on or on the station of Saint-Lazare to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers took place, while the results were reviewed which the associations had classified as "thought" on Friday afternoon after the meeting with the leadership.
The RER manager proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for RER A concerning all relevant aspects, working hours, careers etc..
But that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they call for a long-term wage.
The CGT was conspicuous that RATP itself puts its pay-out proposals in brackets and stressed that the headquarters "can't be able to solve a problem while this was possible with the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a renewed meeting was planned for the "consumption of working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company ignores "the weekend drivers".
On the morning, some 150 drivers were looking for the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the headquarters who rejected any discussion during the strike, and a meeting following a restoration of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to reach the line RER B for a pre-preaching of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a payout of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, from which 30 euros are varyable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they argue the deterioration of the working conditions on this route on which millions of travelers are on the road daily.
The drivers of the RER line, which has over years of professional experience, involve a bruttolohn of 2,200 to 2,700 Euro, as well as a pay-out of 600 to 650 euros for layers and sun and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court triggers pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the Pro-Curdian Main Party of the Land; a decision to follow immediately woven demonstrations in the Kurdish Community in the southeast of the country and Istanbul.
This decision is threatening the government's work that strives to end the Kurdish Community in order to end the conflicts that have been 25 years ago.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it became a "place for activities that are disadvantaged for the independence of the State and its impartial unity", said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the press decision.
According to Kiliç, the decision would be adopted unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes were necessary to hang the resolution. In addition, he pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including the President Ahmet Türk and the Parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political events for the duration of five years.
In addition, the judge stated the withdrawal of Parliamentary immunity, which enjoys doork and tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the goods of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
The leaders of the party expressed that the parliamentarians would rather leave the Parliament as to devote, as part-less parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP to follow the "recisions" of the Worker Party Kurdians (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and numerous other countries as terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures to have "no connection" to the PKK, refuses to describe it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court shall take place by the government, which is strived to meet the Kurdish Community and propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds to allow the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-examination of tensions in Southeast Anatoly, where many demonstrations against the liability conditions of the PKK-Chefs Abdullah Öcalan had led to collapses with the police over the last few weeks.
Since the admonition of the court, thousands of demons were gathered together before the spaces of the DTP in the million city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mainly populationd by Kurden.
The order forces used tear gases and water lamps when the demons began to throw molotovcocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the judgment, Turk assumed that the court's decision "the despair will continue to deepen".
"Turkey can't clarify this (Curdian, Anne Redaction) question on the basis of the ban of a party," he explained the press.
The government, consisting of a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose from principle against the closing of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a tolerance of the democratic opening supported by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can evidently make yourself focused on a response from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday the PKK was known to be an attack in which three days earlier seven soldiers lived in the north of Turkey, one of the most brutal attacks in the past months.
The snow break may come
A right chicken winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to shine the citizens, the winter service leader of the FES says.
Specially, so that his employees can try and dominate the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend it could be so far, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to care for snow and ice.
The FES is taking place after a precise plan.
As soon as it cuts surface and temperatures below zero degrees, 20 so-called A tracks with large vessels are driven, Brauburger explains.
These include main roads and roads such as the new roadway and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire fighters, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with cases, such as the Atzelberg Street.
The FES service starts at 3 p.m.
The approximately 1040 kilometers should be stretched in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt that is better arrested.
Therefore, FES starts at three o'clock at night, "for the routes are free until professional traffic starts".
It'll be difficult when it gets cut at 7.30 p.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because no one is ready to make the scatter vehicles place."
Only after that, as it does not cut on, the supply and locking roads, which also belongs to the Council-Beil-Streets, are in the series.
The last priority has side- and side-ways.
There there will be complaints, White Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES' football takes place on the way, hazardous points and transitions are priority.
For all wheelways, FES couldn't usually care.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps the bridges in mind from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since it is available on this fast plane, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, this will also be called by the police.
The wheat of Dinosaurus
Tawa Hallae looked like many other meat fertilizers: The two meters long and 1.50 meters big animal walked on two strong back legs, had a long shelter with sharp, bowed teeth, short arms with embarrass and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, she wouldn't be a special thing.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was at that time in a dry zone of the Pangäa Supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window for early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationship, the spread and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaceologists started a grave on the Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaurier chens on a day, which is unusual for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones identified researchers quickly as a new kind.
During the excavation they together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theory about Dino-fresh history
The name "Tawa" comes from the solar god of Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary found: "Dinosaurier fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly you can find only single pieces."
Other Dinosaurus experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
Especially spectacular is not this found, but he confirms some theories about the early history of Dinosauriers, says about Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current apprenticeship, the dinosaurs first raised about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossiles are incomplete, but why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts are discussing when the Echses were divided into their three main development lines: the meat-freshing theropodes, with which later the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and the birds belonged to the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is an original theropode.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At Tawa Hallae's damage, researchers found evidence of air sacks, as they also possess the descendants of the theropodes, the birds.
Thanks to the air bag, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than those of the mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the whirl piles were evidently somewhat filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacks, says Randall Irmis.
As the related line of the huge sauropods later also possessed air sacks and light-construction breasts, the common organism of both groups probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive lived by well-known dinosaurs in South America, researchers practised that the Echses were opening there for the first time.
So the three development lines were already early and expanded from South America over all parts of the earth, which then formed a single land mass as a supercontinent of Panga.
The fact that the team together with Tawa Hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropodes.
The three cannot be borne from a common, emigrated predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, Alan Turner says of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a competitor of the Science Study.
Of course there are also contradictions.
An older kind of silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn Paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted image because in South America only many primitive Dino fossiles have remained, while there is hardly something to be found on other continents.
As the Dinosauriers managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant farmers of the age of the earth is still advisable.
During the Trias, the Dinosauriers shared their living room with many other reptiles, for example with the advances of today's crocodiles and air oxygens and with many other eclipses.
By the end of the Trias, the dynasatures were widened all over the world and developed many new species, while the association at the border of the Trias starved out from the Trias to the jura.
The history of success did not forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that the dinosaurs randomly survived, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could hit the competition from the field.
At least, the history of success did not choose forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite attack of a group of animals that had already developed in the trias and has been a moisture of shadow: the sown.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signers are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto stand on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Dozens from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The Police Ruming of the occupied casino of Frankfurter Goethe-University is rising waves worldwide.
278 Professors and Teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarized with Protestant students at the Westend Campus.
In a German and English declaration, "missbillers" explain it to the police invoked by the Bureau.
Uni-Präsident Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and teachers in the field of education in the last week because walls and artworks were injured.
Five students were injured.
The damages, judged the signatorys, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organisated teaching events of students and teachers by a police command".
The rape represents a "not acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on Vandalism serves "deligitisation and crime of protest" and devoted from the content.
The Bureau has dismissed the necessary discouragement.
Dozens demand the immediate attitude of criminal persecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support damage, says it.
Tests authenticated
The youth of the Verdi trade unions and the German trade unions are also solidarized with the students.
The protest is legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi-Landesjugend Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessisches Wissenschaftsminister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), however, defended the action of universities and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the Union.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have understanding of the protest, but we do not understand Vandalism, according to the CDU-Country Day-Deputy Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of interfering with the arguments and demands of the students, you have admitted.
The left has submitted an application that calls on the Minister of Interior to report on the police system.
New Silicon Valley
For many years she was a secret city, inaccessible for Western visitors.
Selengrad, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was a strictly monitored location for secret armor research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, are considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, Representatives Selengrad's contacts with the Frankfurt Science Location Riedberg had been linked to the universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and now signed Selengrad and Riedberg in Frankfurt on Wednesday.
The Moscow Vice-Bürgermeister Juri Rosljak and Prefekt Anatoly Smirnov from Selengrad led to the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt Planungsdezer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized company will travel to Selengrad for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also economic relations.
FIS is able to take foot on the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian science firms want to prohibit orders in Germany.
Selengrad is the seat of major Russian research institutions and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute for Electronic Technology, the Great Group of Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Electronica.
The Commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plant city" for arms research.
Selengrad (usually translated "Greenstadt") received its name from the forested hill landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart Bremsklitz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not very enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is clear and simply "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the deepening of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will storm the city of the bathing-württemberg country capital for a decade in heillos's construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headway stations with gloves that ended in the middle of the city were then a transport engineering fossils of the 19th century, which acted like brims of modern rails, as it once had an enormous time to surround locomotives from back to front.
Walk, keep a short time, continue - that's what it's supposed to be going.
And therefore the headway stations should disappear in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit train station, located about half the trans-European rail mass between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the Slogan from the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually approached, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost unpaid in the Hessian and Bavarian Great Town to implement the deepening.
However, headway stations have no longer accommodation and exit problem since there are modern turnroads with motor vehicles and cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 is now approaching the ICE new building track to Ulm.
Country and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is involved, even because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not the national groups are carrying.
The project can still be justified by urban construction.
It creates new city room, which - believes the computer-generated graphics of the planets - is equipped with a lot of greens.
S21 is harmful for the transport system rail.
The transit railway station and the route expansion are thought to be used for the transport of persons, which is typically 80 years old.
At that time there wasn't the competition of the coefficients.
However, modern transport policy must first be to strengthen goods traffic because transport is more environmentally friendly than by trucks on the road.
However, the new construction track does not do due to strong increases for freight trains.
Even more dignified is that S21 is indirectly also tangling many other railway projects.
Well six billion euros are to be banned in the Swedish.
This is the official number.
Experts believe 10 to 15 billion to realistic.
In the next decade, money will be missing at other nodepoints and units in the network.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the list of transport ministries.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 km long route through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, the trasse is being built at the time of opening.
It would be necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will work as a brake clause.
The Rhinetal Train will be a bottle for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government checks judgment on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Landtag, the government of the State has opened whether it will go into revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to examine the more than 400 pages comprehensive VGH-Urteil legally, said Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written on this day that the country had to re-run the night flight ban in the Frankfurt airport in the case of construction of the planned Northwest Landebahn.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as the national government provides, should not be compatible with the legally required protection of the population against nightly flight law.
The coalition must decide on whether to combat the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this objection and urged the government's representatives to revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, it should be considered as "trust break".
It's damnly difficult to keep his word, said Greenen-Chef Tarek Al-Wazir in announcement to the FDP-Wahlslogan "We keep Word".
Minister Posch pointed back the preface of Schäfer-Gümbel to try the government of the country to come to their night flights with "right rotation and tricking".
A precise legal examination needed its time.
Coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "snatch first impression".
We need a legally secure defense, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they suggest the opposition, the statements of his group would never have been for the night flight ban.
US banks pay back aids
The US-Great banks crowned down their state fessels.
The Bank of America has paid the aid from the Tarp Banking Fund on Wednesday at a total of $45 billion (EUR 30 billion).
And the Citi Group also intends to refund State aid after a report by the US Sender CNBC.
The institutions want to complete the restrictions received by the adoption of the money, such as the limitation of the payment of manager bonuses and the establishment of high fees.
The Bank of America had a total of $19 billion fresh money for investors about change loans.
The rest of the sum took it from its own bag, which, among other things, was well filled by savings.
Bank Chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The fine has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had raised at the highest point of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citi Group wants to provide money on the capital market for its liberation from its obligations to the State.
Even on Thursday, the US bank could announce about $20 billion serious increase in its capital, reported CNBC under profession on circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to express himself.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid their aids back in June.
Quick choice
It went faster than thought.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed off the official editor Nikolaus Brender from the office, the sender can present a successor.
Last night, the body wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender - officially to not prescribe the procedure.
However, there may have also been a role to avoid further damage to the ZDF intentant Markus Schachtter, and this proposal should not be done by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schachters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the body.
The result of the vote was not yet fixed in the editorial conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, slaughter with his proposal to extend the Treaty with Nikolaus Brender for another five years was failed in the Board of Directors.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven voids against him. Brender's election was a herd defeat for scars, but a expectable one.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that Brender would not want to confirm in the office.
The opposition had been organised against the Chief Secretary of the Hessian Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that, under Brenders, the ZDF’s news broadcasts had lost to limit quotas, he refused another term of office of the high-speaked editor.
Until just before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was collected.
Recently, even 35 national lawyers had interfered into the debate, which estimated that Cook's action as unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do.
To person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, paedagogics and romantics.
He then worked at the Southwest Radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, first of all to the "huh-journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referendum of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Head and Moderator of the "Morgen Magazine"; until 2001 Head of the ZDF-Außen Policy; since the head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after Brender's election, which was elected by the Media Magazine to the journalist of the year on Wednesday.
Cooks Widerpart in the Board of Directors, Rheinland-Pfälzic Minister President Kurt Beck, explained last week that countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that staff proposals of the Intentant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also concluded a extract of party politicians from the civilian supervisory bodies.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended the Board of Directors with a clever chesszug - by he severely criticized the body immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both Schachter could nominate him for the heads of editor and choose the Board of Directors without suspicion to get a partyganger into the office.
In the partyarithmic Frey is counted to the left liberals.
Study is disrupted
Participation for students: After a year of education, the Ministers of Culture of the Countries finally launched on Thursday: A meeting of Ministers and College Rectors conference agreed both sides to wish to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
The students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In each individual they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only end with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students is to be checked and "a realistic and defenseable measure" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify recognition of audit services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries have been obliged to make more flexible structures for bachelor and master studies.
There is no need to be any different country schemes.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, culture ministers and universities have carried the winged word from better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was first filled with a specific content.
The so-called accreditation Council decided to partially reduce the number of tests: "Every module usually closes with just one test", says in a 30-page paper which is intended to re-run the authorisation of study courses.
With the "decisive reduction of the test load", the President-in-Official Reinhold Grimm said, a "feel development of einhoud which significantly affected studyability" should be offered.
In addition, the "studieability" is to be "the crucial criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content are "to check striving" whether "unnecessary inclusions of the students in the choice of the
Events would be avoided.
Students would have "proposed to receive room, enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the authorisation of new, but also to the verification of existing courses.
These must be "reacted" every five years – but what means that it takes until 2015 until all courses have been verified.
In this respect, ten accreditation agencies, which are set up by the countries, are bound to support the accreditation Council.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had called for "consultation" to act on the agencies that the substances are not too large and that the audit regime is not too strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and high schools have already agreed to appropriate measures with national ministries.
As a single country, Rheinland-Pfalz has added additional means for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities are intended to set up most of the tutors programs, and to strengthen study advice, as well as audit and foreign officers.
Country and universities want to set up ten million euros for this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a Novelle of the University Law to Parliament.
This will only require a single test for the completion of a study model.
The study design is intended to become more flexible, also to ensure recognition of performance evidence at other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
All studies of the country will be examined until the end of the year.
Government and opposition had again encountered the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Juso High School Groups demanded that the design of education policy should not take place in the future "declarated doors" of ministers and university recorders.
The students should now also “criminate a word” as concerned.
Support received the future academics from the President of the University Rector Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with which the RKK charged a joint reform paper.
The trade union education and science (GEW) did not go far enough to Bonn's decisions: it calls for a legal claim to allow each graduate with a Bachelor conclusion to access a further master study course.
On the other hand, countries need to ensure that there are sufficient master studies places available for today's generation of Bachelor students tomorrow with best possible study conditions, says GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The countries have to set more dozens.
However, to a more free access to the master, the ministers of Culture did not express themselves.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Introduction in Germany and out of is almost no control..." is the initial line of a poem of Lyriker Werner Sölner, in which these in distorting language vessels the arrival of a dissident who won freedom, but at the same time lost its language space.
In 1951, Werner Sölllner worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book sales before he transferred to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söller has been awarded with various literature prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt Poetic lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is head of the Hessian Literaturforum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
On last Tuesday, he cared for a significant outliterary overlooking during a meeting in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the securitate mirror of their securitate acts".
Visually, Sölner is uncertain and blame a statement in which he lay in front of rumänia German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, had his work as IM for Romanian secret service Securitates.
Together with some of the present, Sölner had received the German language prize in 1989.
The recruitment tests would have started slandering first, 1971.
I'm, Sullner closed, "also someone who didn't warn himself enough against the securitates."
The Lyriker Werner Sällner is IM Walter.
At the same time, with the nobel price increase for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary conflict with the mechanisms of dictatoric government, the Community will shake the literature scene and in particular the Community of the German authors from Romania by a case that makes known the grounds and the defectation of a political system that is based on monitoring and spectration.
Whoever Söller is, as far as you can say, not only a perpetrators, but also victims.
In his securitate act, IM Walter played a role, said after the consent of Sölner of the literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of the IM Walter.
He found himself in all for him at that time "torture out," says Markel.
It is a moral need to make this note.
However, Sölner's declaration was in the form and before this audience unexpected, completely surprising is not the confession of an former dissident and his cooperation with Romanian secret service.
In July, Herta Müller had already read her own document, 914 pages, as a cosy reserve for Securitate-Spitzel.
The victims, so you may think, are speculated and, in some case, also knew which clear name was hidden behind the sorin, Vocu and just Walter.
In contrast to the fact that the Stasi acts are now very procedural insights of the securitate monitoring process are still very diffus in dealing with the retirement of securitate monitoring.
A systematic enlargement has been driven and disabled over the past years.
One of the birthday members of the national Council on the preparation of securitate acts (CNSAS) was founded until 1999, but there was rather a sleeving of the records.
Only since 2005, there is a law governing the administration of the documents.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, after the notifying of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, a interview in which a former Securitate Chef from Temesvar abusively expressed the prize player.
She's got a psychosis, and finally she was just heard.
The infamie of power here meant to be unholy interpreted in the form of freedom of opinion.
Surely, the case of sulfurs, as often as in connection with weak guilt, are unavoidable questions.
Who has been damaged? The special reaction of the listeners to Söllers hopes that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge rather than by guilt and shame.
To cure the work of Herta Müller, who took the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than one footnote.
Saturation leaflet Champions League
It acted when there was just an adreadly dressed foreign minister from a very nice Christmas celebration on which a sports product manufacturer Goodies had distributed when the new VfB-Trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic towels of the outpour, increased a quarter hour after midnight to a calling C-class.—
The man with the remarked glacier had been chauffed because of him yet strange city.
Otherwise he could also have driven himself - alcohol wasn't in the game, and the 55-year-old was as little as well.
Was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or just go right.
In the words of the first three days before, Switzerlander is obliged: "We have reached the eightelfinal," namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we are not allowed to mix from success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the rise."
The "great important task" was on Sunday.
Then it is true to repeat the King class performance in Liga everyday life in Mainz.
And the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three gates by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Explosion
The Eightel Final of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16./17. + 23./24 February/replay 9./10. + 16./17. March) is released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the plenty of adherence of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only in the measuring healer who had given the insecured Stuttgart professional in the short period of self-vertrouw, operational willingness and fun of play.
I went to the players and told them that they should consider their strengths, and have stopped them to be discouraged, soul clergyman Gross explained the so simplely sound success recept, which had no effect timed under therapeut Babbel.
He has made a certain magic, admitted Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "if a new impulse in the soccer comes, sometimes happens things that you wouldn't have been considered possible."
And Sami Khedira, who investigated the best player at the place after weekly injuries, tried to describe the "people" with the speaking "fresh wind" and the working way of the new board: "He is a man who passes through and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel, it was evident that it had begun.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns the sports board Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs mainly consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers also guarded themselves from evaluating the victory against a weak and completely overrequired defense of Romanian guests.
You would also have won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen had come to the bad guard, gave Khedira to mind.
And the sports board Horst Heldt said that although a seasonal goal was achieved, the other one was still in a distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that heroes were not after the first holiday since three months, on the events of the weekend, which were relieved in the form of a direct television interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann, which was released in the form of a direct before the game start.
There are decisions that others take and not the Jens, held heroes the harsh criticism of Lehmanns.
He had revealed the board's weakness of leadership and decided to change the trainer to print publishing fans.
Also, that his free day was deleted after games, Lehmann appreciated as signs of lack of sovereignty and misgrace.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure egoism", ceiling hero back and announced consequences for the man.
They're probably not going to be friends for life, the two 40 years old.
However, they agreed with all others that without the preparatory work by the dissolved trainer team, they would not have been able to play a playful and fighting strong idea.
Babbel and his wizards had "a great share in success," said hero and Lehmann unisono - and also the man agreed with the plastics.
WM Weight in the Gravity Weight
Heaty Duell in Bern: Herausforder Kevin Johnson World Championshiper Vitali Klitschko again provoked with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, Ukraine defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The judgment of the pointrighter was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains in the heavyweight box champion.
The 38-year-old Champion after WBC's version last night at Bern, the US-American Kevin Johnson was unanimous in points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, Ukraine was two times World Championships WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it wasn't jumped with the K.o. who all expected.
Klitschko built his balance at 39 wins in 41 professional campaigns, twice he had to be hit because of injuries.
Required Johnson had to take the first defeat in 24.
Around 17,000 viewers in Berner Arena wanted to dictate the battle of 2,02 meters, especially with his left hand of leadership.
The 11 centimeter small Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko-Era before the duel, but repeatedly escaped the slaughter of the World Championships so that Klitschko could not make his dangerous rights critical.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a demander and tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his sleeves met the World Championshiper only rarely.
After all, he's only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who has gone with Klitschko about the full distance of twelve rounds.
The requirer had cared for some whirlpools before fighting in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "heartly zombie", which can't be right.
When the champion was weeped, the champion was then provoked to shube Johnson the sunbrille from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory to Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also stayed in his fourth battle after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After nearly four years of age, he had then beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took his "sy" WBC-gürtel, which he had to give off camplos.
In this year he then forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the U.S.
I only got a stroke in this battle and I'm very well in the form of physically, Klitschko had just founded the fast return to the ring.
His dream remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is World Championships WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA's belt is wearing David Haye after it was able to escape the 2.13 meters of Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously suspended a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
His promotion society is now already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadion.
Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from opposition: Green-Fraction Chief Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg for false information on customer affairs as Lügner.
SPD and links call for explanation from the operator.
Hamburg/Berlin - The opposition Minister Karl-Theodor at Guttenberg (CSU) has made a conscious deception after the recent findings on the air attack of Kunduz.
The Minister said, for the death of bombarding on two tank trains of September, "knowledgedly the ignorance," said Greenen-Fraction Chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday at the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It's called the land: He's lying.
The order to kill has been granted under disregard of the rules of the International Protection Truppet for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that the NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was known that the attack was not only about a destruction of the delegated loads but also about killing two Taliban leaders.
According to Nato investigation report, the US-required US-Luft Attack was killed or injured by the German Kunduz Commander, until 142 people were killed or injured.
Greens, SPD and Links called on Saturday Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) to express themselves immediately before the Federal Day and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of the targeted death is part of the Afghanistan policy of the Federal Government - and whether, in the hands of Presidential office, federal warfare and news service, Jürgen Trittin and Green Collegin Renate Künast demanded.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm decided to revert the criticism.
The Chancellor Office did not influence concrete intake of the Federal War in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday there were doubts about the representation of the Ministry on the background of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have been informed correctly and fully about the backgrounds of the Tancluster attack.
Officially, they had promised the existence of the Nato reports and have kept the Minister sensitive details.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, it said that they had noted the Ministry of Defense even on several reports, including a two-sided document of the Head of the Commander Small and a report of Years.
Wichert is supposed to have asked in a letter for clarification of the case, reports the "Frankfurt General Sundayszeitung".
He has not received an answer until now, says it.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not refer to the preliminary remarks and pointed out that this was explained in the Committee on Research of the Bundestag, which would like to constituent on the coming Wednesday.
Space worlds
Some see images in wachemic state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in psychological sickness and in drug noise, the limits between imagination and reality shift.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's okay.
If we are in our dark room with closed eyes, we must give ourselves the most wild ideas and imagination images.
However, those who experience dreamy conditions, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are mostly considered crazy or dry in the modern Western world, at least as special.
However, such pictures and voices are not only in psychological sickness or in drug noise.
Debt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels, sometimes make sure that the limits between dream, wound, and reality vary.
In the best case, we call them visions, in the worst case, Wahn.
Even if the visions of the mysticist Hildegard of Bingen may differ and may differ, the drug experiences of the New Age-Propheten Carlos Castaneda, shamanic depressions, psychoshes and hallucinations can be reduced to similar processes.
Halluzinations or Wahns are created when the balance of the neuronal bones of the brain - all advanced dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholin - is distorted and the interaction of various brain parts is corrupted.
Complex hallucinations and desirable thoughts occur very often during a shizophrene psychosis.
The heavy force has no power over him
The relationship of wahn and dream has been involved by philosophers and medicines since ancient times.
Aristoteles understood hallucinations as a form of dream in a wake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, founded in 1861 a "great similarity of irreen with dreams", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was "a psychosis, with all imaginations, woundings, sense disorders of such".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turned into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and silent.
The heavy force has no more power over him, he sweats on the room blanket.
He feels a step.
Behind him, devil's designs flocked with bloody, deteriorate fratzens, similar feating.
They hung him, get him with heavy, flaming steppings, throw him against the walls, he feels the pains throughout the body.
Volumes, malicious voices drone from walls and radio.
He can't endure them anymore, the voices that emphasize and discipline him.
Henning T. cuts two cables out of the stereo plant, knocks her to a snail and tied them on a hake on the ceiling.
He rises on a loud speaker and puts the slander around the neck.
Jump.
The snails will be solved.
This should be a lesson to you, and the voices cry in drumffth chor, "Go into the clinic and let you heal!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosen, the last is 2 years back, the first nearly 20 years.
It was dissolved by LSD.
His diagnosis is chizoffic paranoide psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes medicines, against the depression, the manie, the shyophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, he has been married for three years.
In my psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
Drug images are cruel reality
About a percent of the population suffers at least once in the life of shizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as a two-tube illness after depression.
In an acute shizophrene psychosis, subjects usually no longer can differ between the inside and the outer world, they are administered in an excessive state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
The voice listening is particularly widespread - voices, commands, comment or dialogueing.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The affected cannot be able to separate importantly, the brain can no longer filter distorting signals, the consciousness is overwhelmed by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the clues for a flood of ideas and fantasys that deprive deeper consciousness.
The realistic perception in psychosis is subjective, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The skizophrene is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning on him.
At the same time, he has a passive role, it is overwhelmed by the events, and cannot actively form it.
So skizophrene often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A realistic balance is usually not possible, the fraud images are grievous reality, waxed out.
One time in life to have experienced a hallucination
In contrast to the dream, Fuchs says, "but keeps the mental and spacious structure of the reality that is perceived in the psychosis in principle."
The reluctant thoughts and hallucinations found in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats Capriolen, researchers still face mystery.
Exceptions can lead to a short-term loss of reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic approximation to shizophrenia, but twilling studies have shown that genes are not the only-determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimum brain damages in affected persons.
We suspect that the neuronal maturing of the brain is disturbed in an early stage of development, for example by an virus disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery as the disturbance of the neuronal system that is not at first manifested for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggered for a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Halluzinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they take into the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The depressed thing is that psychotics suffer under their hallucinations and swallow tender medicines to get them out, others spend money for drugs to get what, says the Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Box.
It is often merely a question of the point of view as a pleasant or unambiguous image.
Box has been collecting reports of hallucinations and illuminations for ten years, last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The irregular world in our head".
Although hallucinations are among the typical accompanying illnesses of psychosis, many other diseases also surprisingly.
These include psychological disorders such as border line or depression often also diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple skleroses, or alzheimers and skeledelhirtraumata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain is hallucinating healthy people.
Halluzinations, so box, consist of memory contents that are normally retained.
They arise when brain areas, in which sense observements are processed, are overactive or too little resistant; if our brain runs hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damages or a psychosis.
But also rice, stress, lover or other mental exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the interviewed people claimed to have experienced a hallucination at least once in life.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visited the Gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If the pictures and voices weren't there.
In the break it may happen that a slaky boy speaks to it with long, dark hair.
If it answers, the fellow students look surprised to -- nobody else sees or hears these boys.
They think the shy girl for a mocked daytraumer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream that she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees these boys, just as she hears the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy?
But she knows that this boy and the other troops aren't real and disappear again.
Nights are the appearances most alarming
Often the troops are also a burden.
When it sits in the classroom, it cannot sometimes follow the material because the teacher in her eyes and ears just prefers a new pupil while he explains mathematical parables for all others.
Nights are the appearances most worrying.
If she waits for sleep in her dark room, who gets too rare and much too late, she can often not distinguish whether she's awake or already dreams whether the pictures she sees, the frats or the girl with the bloody cut wounds on arms and legs, before her open or closed eyes arise.
Let me calm down, she calls the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell her that they'd be mad.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is today 20 years old.
She's been living the abitur last year and lives together with her friend.
One year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has been contacting the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she isn't crazy.
Wahn is also an artwork of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or suffers under rice, he has great probability after a while of hallucinations, says box.
I suspect that the brain is then underemployed and cares for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a single boy, had feared other children as a little girl, often played her alone.
Her hallucinations began when they learned with 13 that the man that she called Daddy since she can think is not her file father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that process real impressions and noises, such as Sarah K, it is difficult to distinguish truction images and reality. "Every experience," says Box, "finds in the brain, the reality is there.
Halluzinations are also images that cause the brain to create, so they work so real."
Nighty dream images also show box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of health are not fundamental to those of acute psychosis.
Unlike skizophrenen, psychic health are able to recognise their fraud images as irregular.
Therefore, box advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Limit state between dream and hallucination
In our too conscious world, unfortunately imaginary experience is usually pathogenized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and head doctor of the Clinic for Psychiatrie and psychotherapy of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, suffering illness, but it also birgts positive, creative - wound is also an artwork of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of traumaticly changed guard consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experience is real and which it cannot differ from the guard state in the afterhand.
Oneiroide consciousness occurs in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradicitis patients who experience motor leasing in full consciousness.
If a person is threatened by self-degradation and world loss, for example by continuing, complete movement inability, he replaces the life threatening real situation by a own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since the management of a situation in reality is not possible, there is a change in the world, but the real situation is encountered in imagination.
A intense form of sense and sense in an imperative situation that enables us to make humans their own designability not to do in a nothing of consciousness loss.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Cürcher Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart collapse operation with next heart transplantation is daily on travel, while his body is sentenced to unmoral movement at the intense station.
Claussen attract a self-made world, visiting strange times and places: He experiences himself as a bedding, old man, on board a train torture, a robot waits for his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages with adliges making rice from blood.
If a Greek is slapped on the motorcycle in its homeland, it surfs with its spinal bed in the Firnschnee of the Alps and meets a Korean Mafioso.
He goes completely on in the imaginated event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal travels are fundamentally different for clauses from each dream.
Traum is another condition, he describes his experience.
On the other hand, the memories of mental travel are overdue for years and in addition to the details.
Excellent and intense even more than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience sprouts the horizon of our other life-wide experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroide, Psychosen, Halluzinations and Drug Rush show how brutal our internal images of the outer reality are also watching.
Any change of consciousness, the psychologist box resembles, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A experience that can certainly be enriching.
The snow break may come
Burda
Children should take the publishing with 27 years
The new publisher Kallen is a intermediate solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding is also supposed to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit with 27 years and have the firm will to enter into the company, the 69-year-old said to the SPIEGEL.
The details about this have been careful.
The question whether they are active in the company is only thereafter.
The question too is whether they are able to do so.
You cannot suggest 7500 employees of his children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he withdraws from the Board of Directors from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen to his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board at Burda since 1999.
First he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for the company’s capacity and after the separation of Jürgen death officers also came to the direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time, no family member stands at the top of the publisher.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was today 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of callen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
With a view to the cases of Sickedance and Schaeffler, Burda expressed that also family companies are not secure before the fall: "This always took families that were intimidated by a capital demand that had been completely speculated and thought that they could rise as a great player.
My strategy has never been that.
He had "no world power dreams," says Burda.
I don't see me as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with 'Time' in the worldliga, and these shops have become too large.

Innovation and exclusiveity seem to be the keywords for this spare area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10:00 a.m. early until 22.00 a.m. 365 days in the year.
The most different Decolletés
Christmas is always closer and therefore it is a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and to get its feast clothing into our clothing wardrobe.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important to prevent the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
This is a few proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an excessive and very complicated decolleté, which can only be rated.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
The power company Endsa has created the "LIVE-Büro" together with Barcelona City.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and meet agreements on mobility by managing, coordinate, subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is designed to combine the promotion of electric cars and opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport in the future.
3 "electric cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
Endsa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community.
These activities include such activities which are related to energy and particularly to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative to take part in the endsa with regard to the promotion of electric cars.
The company is involved in standardisation groups throughout Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT TODE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of tranquillity" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis>>nld<< Zapatero, prophesied by the Spanish automotive industry, who is the largest exporter of the country, "a horizon of peace".
In the idea of the 2009 Economic Report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again reminded the measures taken by the Government to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Not the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry we have today a panorama of neglecting and the slipping of some of our main production works," said the President of the government.
"Thank this plan and the willingness of the automobile manufacturers to produce also in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the granting of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the plan for competitiveness, part of the total plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided 800 million euros for 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which were again providing investments of over 3 billion euros.
The Head of State stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models, as well as for modernisation of the already existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to encourage demand, in announcement to the 2000E plan, which can be applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the automotive manufacturers.
According to the Head of State , this plan allows the exhaust gases to be reduced by 6% in the average of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which led to a "strong growth" in the authorisations that increased by "40 percent" in November.

Mazda3 i-stop: Environmental sports
Mazda wants to prove that sports is fully compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic motor stop and drive system, baptized on the name i-stop, a device which is currently available for the 2.0 gas engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 shows its good notes in the overall image.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are good at the new Mazda3.
Beginning in front seats can be found that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomic and good hold.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
In further consideration of the unit that consists of the instrument table and the armature board, you can notice that Mazda with a variety of buttons and switches is red and blue in the overlooking colors, on the same line as the Japanese trend is to a futuristic inner design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic models, both Japanese models, are deprived of the nutrition of the German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which all wants to meet.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the corresponding comfort, so that four adults can easily drive with the car.
All of this comes a large spacious and clearly formed case room.
The stop and drive system is only available for the 2-liter gas engine with 150 PS and a 6-going stop now.
This engine is a real pleasure. He is based through his fineness, through his mild noise, its performances and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers in the year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its gross comfort in the care and low consumption, even if the diesel models are usually sold in Mazda.
With regard to the equipment, the model sportive is selected for the sample, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the series auction, the assistant for the riding track change (RVM), which thus reduces the dead angle, but also the control elements for the traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive inner level, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air condition, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as the chromed 17-inch flats.
Exactly, this version still includes, as would not be enough for equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional €1.500: besides further elements, the learningable Bixenon lighter and the sound system BOSE with CD-loader.
Fake
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars of his class.
It is particularly exciting with regard to the materials used, due to his driving behaviour and diversity of equipment.
Exactly, those who do not relocate many kilometers in the year can also buy the i-Stop version available only with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative of this model is a little high price which lies between EUR 21.770 for the luxury model and 23.270 for the sampled model sportive.
However, as a contrast to this high price, Mazda3 offers us every day to the New Highest Pass.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red tepppich of the sense of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
In the premiere of "Nine" the stars radiated, dressed in models that look the same elegant as sexy, more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is limited first, a device that can only read its emails without a possibility of seeing some attachments or surfing through the Internet.
It enjoyed his five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine to one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea in itself is especially of interest for young people.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of this, it has brought two new devices to the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, in contrast to the Peek, which has to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterparty, but has paraded a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes Roaming for all Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone around the world already know what it means to have to miss all the data in order to read its emails as soon as you cross the national border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rates is incrediblely vigorous and should actually be long possible.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but my experience needs to be a doctoral title in physics and a good brille to read all the small printed.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission as regards the difficult roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always unreasonable.
You are always afraid of reading his emails and that with right.
That a small device such as FonPeek (when it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of prices, means that the telephone providers need to slowly, but safely think and start to take different possibilities into consideration how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices, the download of books and further requests on the Internet is included.
Without vegetation and without hacking.
It is an internet-able device and it is only one time for it, namely the purchase, and not month for month.
And that is exactly what I expect from FonPeek a day to buy a lifelong Internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
I expect this, because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for consumers.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetic Color of Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the favourite color of the American First Lady.
She appeared in a dress and a mandle of this color and has chosen the same colour again to accompany him with his second most important moment in his life: the granting of the peace nobel price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models for both occasions: no, that it was almost the same colour - a shining green yellow - was the dress of three parts - dress, jas, and coat from the same fabric, and thereby weared somewhat largely tight or a necklace.
It is even so far that in the first sight it was apparent that the first lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the princess of Asturia and had decided to carry the same dress at more than just one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the kind of dust from which they are manufactured.
She took a dress from the top and in Oslo of a patterned seed.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-high paragraphs and for the second time a similar model, but gold colors.
The fridge was also different every time: the hairs were stuck up at this occasion as a hair cranz, in the previous she had the hair open.
75% of the professional mothers have got problems in work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially with younger women who want children.
This results from CSIC's study with the Institute for Women's Fruitability and Career for Women in Spain.
The survey under 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years has no doubt: 75% of professional women see their career cances in the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if yes, what kind of occupation they do.
Those of them who do not perform any other activity, only work half-day or have no fixed work contract, become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women are moving with a firm approach, especially in public areas, the establishment of a family and motherhood, and therefore have less children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a firm approach get their first child in the average only 3,7 years after being coincided, a number increased to 4.1 years for women with a fixed approach that has used longer, to achieve this and who have brought together and have only achieved the first child much later.
Exactly, the type of work also has a great influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar in respect of receiver willingness," CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado explains.
The level of education is another factor which must be taken into account during the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to survey, age is about higher at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be detected in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group were between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they have only the main school conclusion or higher education, averagely with 25,1 or 32,1 for the first time mother.
In addition, depending on the level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women are already married before their first determination and get their first child, women with a medium or high school finish make it very different and are looking for a festival and married after that and then get their first child, Delgado fixes.
Diane Cruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to his beaten list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will be the image of different products of the brand and also the well-known advertising claim "You are worth it".
The main artist from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will become another famous sign of extension as before her Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanierin Penélope Cruz.
Before you were the last one who was allowed to join this exclusive club, the actresses of Evangelist Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the case of the men, the cosmetic company has only exceptional newspapers: Patrick Dempsey (" Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Schauspielkollege von Evangelium in "Lost").
The price distribution of the British fashion industry
The Britains have to talk to an important vocabulary in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met with the annual distribution held in London in the Royal Court of Justice.
To this occasion they were all appeared.
The Ex model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen for the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asses" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the three Röntgenbilder of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearinfluential Genre (short biography, life and work), but looks for a equality to the heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not save any fears or lightings.
Au's being a delicious reader, this book is also a moving invitation to read and read again.
Here's a few cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "I found in reading his pages that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost mental test, as I always found it without sayings: the joy of the unhealthy fate, the moral without guilt and the innocentness without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allgorical Christ, he wrote about what he had in blood, not in his mind, between unclean power and ignorance, with a surrounding poetic Humor, without any sense, as the knife that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was united by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, who moved into her banquets, in whose meat the emotions, because of adultery, with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual Privileg, which was in it to come into heaven on the way of ruining."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summits in the world's literature, one must climb up on the north wall, on the wall, on which the best mountain climber is always trying to get to the New."
About William Faulkner, "He was a funny cheese.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heritage of a charity owner and again said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams testified by a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy cry, who was cried out by a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo to deep into the night of the 20th century swallowed in his literary way. This made he flew in a journey on his own, and with a speech full of violence to the worms, he fled after the world.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knocks and prayed: my worshipper God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "In his grave, these verses of Spencer are buried: 'The sleep after the effort,/ after the wound of the port,/the rest after the war, or after a satisfaction of life you will find fun in death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In her bag she always had her depressions.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII pioneered them between the Azales or sang the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case, where the man brought up so much patience and in a neurotic person whose literary talent was much larger than its depression."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos make than trying to put Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet mean if he didn't bring Baroja into the guns of Faulkner?
What did Cela make, except to destroy that man's roem, so that he can put himself on this podest?"
Fight Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our city part in the town of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years from her and our dog died, our dog is a mixture that we took out of the animal home and who just weighs six pounds, and then from heatheart they missed him two footsteps and wounded him.
Our relaxation can not be found in words because it is indispensable where the passage should be at a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was naturally carried out on the line.
In this way, the first-face attack, which a woman who was going to communicate, comes when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, for if such a laundry attacked a dog, he may be the same thing with a woman, a child, an older Lord or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a usually quiet district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very common Tuesday.
The dog has rejoiced all day.
Of course, we have paid ads at a nearby police office, but we have great doubts that this will bring something at all and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the fig criminals were Spaniards.
Our reassurance on the event has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what is happening in the heads of these young people that she finds a cheap attack on a helpless animal fun, on a animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect have remained to the animals and the people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In collaboration with the Spanish Transport Security Foundation (Fesvial) the tyre producer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmet, especially with younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is the only protection element that can prevent head injuries or even death in case of motorcycle accidents.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport safety, which "develops far more than only the design and manufacture of products that will become safer every day" and further confirmed that it also contributes to other actions to pedagogical and informative characteristics to get a step closer to that goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle running under the Slogan 'To be or not to be' will be distributed to more than 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase of posters in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and just because it is the reason why, as a manufacturer of two-wheel vehicles, it is always obliged to see that one of its main goals must be the development of ever more secure products.
Sales of minor trucks rises again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters will finally begin to see something light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles that have been approved in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in 2008, and what is even more important, they are thus the first increase in 22 consecutive months, with increasing decline, compared with the figures presented by Ganvam manufacturer association and the Ganvam car dealer association.
However, these good figures are to be enjoyed at present only with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison from November 2008, which was a particularly poor sales year with a decrease of 60% in the previous year.
However, it must be noted that, in addition to the increase in the last month, the total grants of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales numbers of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95.853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles consisting of the small transport market are included: discounts of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and a lighter smaller truck.
In addition, the same clouds in heaven are still the same, which lead most of the demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private persons, the large part of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases have been purchased with third-party funding.
For these restrictions, which are the result of the turnover of the credit institutions’ credit institutions, there are other factors in which the increase in unemployment rates or the duration of the bad economic situation is concerned.
In this panorama and in contrast to the cars of persons, financial support has not helped the purchase of a vehicle of the 2000E plan.
This plan is, however, not only intended for private persons, but also self-employed and small companies have a right to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 extoss that may not exceed 160 grams per rising kilometer, but the low sales payments speak for themselves.
Just again yesterday, Ganvam remembered that it is essential for the state to focus on these small lasers as well as, of course, on industrial vehicles (last cars and autobuses).
For 2010, the auto dealer cleaning is prophesied for a similar year as the previous year, for which it calculates 19 % of a sales accident (for passenger cars and ground cars).
Support in Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now required
As already happening in the ABS anti-blocking brake system and as it is now with the ESP stability control, aid systems for braking in emergencys must be a obligation in the European cars.
In fact, they have already been obliged to all newly approved passenger cars and small carriers, for the remaining vehicles a caring period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of the mergers, but these brake systems can also help prevent many excel accidents due to their work.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake manoeuver, which means the system to exercise the brake strength performed by the driver on the brakepedal.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation ordered by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers developed in an accident before the collapse no longer came to join the brakespedal and half of them had not burned with full power.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the other hand, the brake aid enters the brake system with maximum power and thus reduces the brake time and thus also the brake distance that lowers a car during the brake operation.
According to a EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants, could be prevented by up to 1.100 deadly accidents in which futurers are being damaged.
There would even be less accidents - it is calculated that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (over wheelar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time exercises a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds thereafter, the system helps him to increase pressure on the brakespedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damages as low as possible.
General engines shift the plan for Opel until January
While the Bureau of Opel Werk in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in the first April week, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the U.S. vehicle manufacturer suggests that he needs more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of the GM Europe, wants to achieve that the side concerned already gives its approval to each individual point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document that is presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which work is available will be moved until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GMs shall be assured that it will take a decision on Saab sale in the following days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American automotive to make it a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to contact some new buyers possible.
One of these buyers might be Gibly, who would like to buy Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer's option of Skyper sports cars, who has a backpacking group of Converg, gains more and more.
If there should be no agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some activa to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to sleep Saab at the end of the year if it has not been sold until then will continue to be maintained.
At the tax of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, engineers used the boxster S as a basis and yet really made it easier to make him 80 kilograms, which now brings only 1.275 kilograms to the scale.
In order to create such a thing, they were the first one of the automatic drop-up roof, which was replaced by a tentle wall roof by manually drive, so that only 21 kilograms have been distributed; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "pass away" another 15; by the outtake of air conditioning even 13; the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 litres, so that further 7 kg were distributed; by the installation of sporty bacquet sessions 12 again and with the light 19-inch flats again five.
Then, through the failure of the CDR-30 audio system, one had again reached six pounds less and the exchange of the door handles from dust, the missing kilograms.
Although he is also available with the double-cupplement PDK, the sample ride was carried out with a vehicle with 6-passed hand drives, mainly on the smaller landstreeks of California, on mountain routes that really seemed very cool.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the note tadellessly.
However, the reduction of his weight has not resulted in the fact that he would no longer be safe on the street.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for long we haven't threatened a so small and light model, which also gives you a feeling of great security at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlet to warm up his muscles at a low walk in the necessary time until we give him the commands to smell, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine...
He's doing everything you're saying to him, and this car makes everything that we'll dispose of him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he makes it with the precision of a surgeon.
A engine sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine appetites that has already been used at the Panamera first.
The acceleration capacity is unpredictable brutal, regardless of whether out of the stain or once again accelerated.
The feathers are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the countryside, where we went with the Boster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car was well mastered.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and that, although we found some of these curves ice in the morning grays and roll splits in the morning.
In summary, one can say that there is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an unwritten passport, as it may be rather rare, and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be marketed in February 2010 and will cost 70.831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of Coco Cococoon cosmetic line and an opportunity starlet in the fashion views of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck starry as her pockets of Chanel.
More than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated a excellent triumph with 82-91 in his visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra Football field and comes to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, which was with eight three times the best of his team (29 at the rating).
Vitoria’s team could replace the major cases of Mr. Mann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and team work even if they were waiting for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter out with 16 assessed three-folds usually contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue reds, which from the beginning put to the top on the show table.
Since the first four baskets of Vitoria's team were already out of the perimeter, they could already mention that they had come to the game field with well warmed handwrecks.
They were English and Teletovic, who were mostly responsible for the 18-20 in the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava was decided for a innerly-sided barac game and for Eliyahu's game, who was received in his return to the team with pavets and applaus, who is his home to further develop their advantage to the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating of Splitter already thought that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Yet, despite the clear advantage in the break, the Maccabeans had not long decided, and the Vitorians wanted to remember that in their game field, not everyone wins, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed critically to the turning of the ruder (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few play trains with fire safety to get back to air and with one of them suddenly came the pistools of Mirza Teletovic, who had three almost consecutive threefolds and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the display table it was displayed again of (54-67), which the host was able to show with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavesen were already announced in the last quarter of flowers and English and San Emeterio (60-75) that they would allow nobody to re-establish the victory they earned in the first three minutes.
In addition, Pnini and Eidson resigned not the best of their team and tried to give their team back through three points from the line (70-77).
Yet, and although splitter was put out because of Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, well and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost hardship in Greece against Olympiacos and had to step down the leadership in the B Group of the Euroliga, and that in a game that was marked by the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially with the interior game, which facilitated the Greek victory.
Málaga's team had no fear of the stimulation in the hall of peace and friendship, nor the opponent team, which may be one of the strongest of Europe and has a lot of money.
The Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming in the first quarter. A aggressive defense and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blew the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of being one of Unicaja, even if the local team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis showed the advertency table in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which it was almost coming to the slaughter between the two American Beverley and Williams because of both disqualified.
The Greek team began to become warm, and his superiority on both stakeholders, while the divorce of the Engländer Joel Freeland due to an infringement and the three mistakes of Carlos Jiménez suffered clear traces to Unicaja.
Among their players in the interior and the Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with its three times, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A pickup Jew was impossible
The third square was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olimpiacos, which showed itself despite his 19 losses and even managed to compare the difference of the game carried out in Málaga at 66-48 in the 27th minute, which brought the leadership within the group into the swanks.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many accidents and the excretion of the shots of the game injured during the game Robert Archibald.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31th minute, thanks to the Federation and the Threefold of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was a little hope for 66-57.
Yet, it was actually impossible, as the Olimpiacos was not to breach as soon as he attacked and showed his suspicion with centimeters within the corb area.
The Croatian Captain Nikola Vujcic created it in the 37th minute to rise the corb diversity to 81-62 and Unicaja had to beat up and the leadership to Olympiacos had to come down.
How much should you earn in Facebook due to his profile?
The Facebook users can now experience their salary, thanks to the new application of Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the holders of the users based on more than 140,000 jobs in Spain. Users are available for a form in Facebook in which their profession, professional experience, age and city in which they work can enter.
Once the application was available for the first week, the search engine found that the Spanish workers are "sensitively paid" in a press release, explains the Trovit product responsible, Albert Ribera.
The Spaniards are the poorest paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Grossbritannia and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross content of 45.226 euro and a French 31.059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros earning a panoramic.
Accordingly, a truck driver has an annual net content of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 Euro in Spain.
According to Trovit, the poorest paid work in Spain is the only one who is a seller with EUR 11.592 annually; followed by the work of a seller with EUR 14.725 and a worker with EUR 15.667.
The most common jobs on the Internet in the last three months are the ones of a driver, half-day and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a period for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its message in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave the diplomatic representation at the latest on 27 January 2010 when his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegation of the Brazilian Embassy in the dogurian capital, confirmed the TV TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he had found the message in which he had found since September 21, Asyl.
"He's aware that he must go on January 27, because his mandate runs off this day and he needs to seek a new accommodation."
The sender also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the date set: "My view is to go as soon as possible, logically with the backdrop of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
Following the elections on 29 November (with which Porfirio Lobo was a winner) Zelaya assured that he will stay in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, he tried this week to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, at the refusal of Zelayas to recognise the status of an asylum seeking politician who wanted to force him the facto government under the presidency of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the most enthusiastic days since last spring, where the inflation of the assets was the prevailing stimulus on the markets, the insecurity has returned to markets, which is not surprising, because this is its natural condition, in a environment where the Makler decides on one of nature of uncertain futures.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debts with direct purchasing of assets and to allow the liquidity of free hand on interest rates moving around the zero so that banks can buy Aktiva for this purpose.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of Aktiva have been completed as well as, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, to start scattering some sand into the drive as it already formed the BCE nec with its annual enlargement, the next week.
Therefore, the investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these iterodox measures and we are just going to witness a conversion in reducing the risk premiums.
The refugees of the stock exchanges and the differences in the company bonus rise again, even if they are far away from the paranormal amounts they have reached at the beginning of the year.
The States saw themselves forced to state private risks and state debts rise again.
They are now resuming quality and the United States, Japan and Germany as the preferred refugee site of investors, which leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries in Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened down with a new revision regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm the defendant of the moral risk that had attempted to suspend the world economic policy responsible for what they had caused, because they had abbreviated the devastating effects that led to the limitation of loans to the loss of workplaces as they were supposed to have a new day for thanks.
Nothing does indicate what happened in Dubai on a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has also been predicted before.
A government, which deviates State debt, elections and a new government that draws the same force.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Susconirates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin is rescuing Hungary at the beginning of the year from the non-completion of their foreign payments and thus allowing a euro member country to no longer comply with its obligations.
On the other hand, Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens in the need of au-decisive measures in order to maintain the stability of government funds.
Yes, we are, as expected before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some exclusions, too high amounts would now be within the expectation.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in State debt are increased by the same speed as the European company bonus.
However, if European differences are reduced and the Spanish are further increased, it would be a special Spanish risk.
This by Standard & Poor's is a farce. During the indicative indicators, a large part of the market research institutions forces to make their scenarios for restoration and to correct their scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all promises no long lifetime, despite warnings.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "force at driving".
Connected branches
The President of Iberdrola, Ignaciož Galán, first of the Parliament's sub-committee, discussed the strategy on energy supply in Spain in the next two decades.
After his appearance on which the President of Gas Natural Feosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán gave some tips about what he had submitted to the sub-committee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros and more 60 billion from this date until 2030, presuming that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this was not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy production capacity but in distributor networks and international bonds.
From 2020 onwards the questionnaire will change and it is necessary to increase performance.
Its proposal focuses on gas and carbon plants with facilities for the capture of carbon dioxide and, of course, mainly, on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the preliminary nomination by other "sponsor powers".
Galán, who believes that the draft budget for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, is on a line with what his company asked, did not want to say anything against this law how to create stimulate for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
His opinion is "in a long term clear to this direction, despite some" individuals", as she referred to the president of Iberdrola.
Be it as it is, Galán thinks that we already have to make decisions on investment, even if they are long-term, since it will need some time and it will have to be created a stable compensation framework to take them into action.
Ferrovial gets the "Handling" from Aer Lingus to 10 airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss port of Switzerland, is the preferred partner of the Irish Fluus company Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important ones.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced, has been established for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Kastilien-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares have signed a protocol on cooperation for the creation of an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures yesterday.
The bond plans investments between 20 million and 2012, of which 50 % of Ferrovial is being originated.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the investigation of energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and bouygues for its first car construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the consent of his first carway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (unlike EUR 1,047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German high level are its competitors.
A 5-mile long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for acciona to establish as a construction company and car operators in the country.
The city administration wishes to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration of a public-private cooperation (PPP has decided the English award) to advance the project after a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and machine management.
In the end of May, estimated investments amount to $1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion) in the last phase of three consorties, especially consisting of European construction companies.
The group named Transcity is launched by Akciena, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second seat in Italy is one of the best specialists for deep construction.
Against the team of Akciena, the North Direct consortium is formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructures and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closer election, is called LBRJV, formed by the capital of the Australian Leighton (Tochtergesellschaft of the German construction company Hochtief, which is part of ACP), the local Baulderstone (in possession of the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the French company Razel specialized for public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructures promises enormous construction and privatizations, however, has a barrier to overcome, as it is only to be obtained through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by those companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has to be pursued by the Spanish constructors.
Even ACP has received access to this market only by its participation of 30% in high depth, owner of the Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona sets high importance in this geographic area for the sector in which it is already well known as energy career and in the dissolution industry as a result of its activity.
It has already been its largest windmilling park (192 MW) in Victoria, which has been commissioned to build and manage the sales plant of Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use this synergies to get access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The subterranean toll track that is supported by the city's infrastructure office in Brisbane, and the northern link (north-to-food) is intended to connect the western carbahn in Toowong with the Umgehung tramway in Kelvin Grove(see map) on a length of 5 kilometer through tunnel. It is the greatest measure for stairering on the streets of Brisbane.
The travel plan issued by the city administration looks for the award for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll should already be opened for transport in the last months of 2014, one assumes that construction works will take place until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two tracks in every direction, an electronic toll system and a complex discharge system.
The Government of Queensland participates in the financing of 500 million dollars (308 million euros).
For high depth, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia gives high depth, which has signed a government contract of 154 million yesterday, significant contracts.
The ACP share will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create a fast Internet access for 400,000 people and take care of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction works have not yet begun, and high depth has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools on 25 years.
The initial investments are 75 million euros.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has provided through its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers length for a carbahn in Slovenia via the total of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the grant for the construction work for the extension of Bosruck's tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine strengthens his experience in tunnel construction.
The beginning of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take place more than 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising of Renfe
Renfe has credited the reclame and marketing services annually for the next two years of the Sra Agency. Rushmore, a sum of about three million euros, informed the railway company.
In this contract, there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months. Sra. Rushmore was selected under 16 agencies, who presented sh to this competition issued by Renfe, from which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of the campaigns.
Crime over 63 million for France Télécom because of the outbreak of competition.
The Rules of Competition in France set up a penalty exceeding 63 million euro for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on fixed network and mobile phone through the signing of exclusive contracts, price plans and faithful programs for consumers on the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopolies and still government firms have gathered more than 560 million euros on penalties since 1994 because of the disabilities of his competitors.
The punishment raised yesterday has even been increased because the Authority, who is waiting for competition, believes that France Télécom has committed similar distortions in the past and has therefore become relapsed.
Market of application
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet in order to increase revenue from businesses not from the telephone connection.
This announcement website of Orange in France and the United Kingdom is essentially active.
One has to wait until 2010 until this settlement will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has developed its birth in 1992 as a source of intake for the Fu­ball Club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, which brings them the third and fifth place of the FuÃ«ball clubs that deserved most of the money in the Liga.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
The Champions League of UEFA brings not only fame with itself. It is also one of the main sources of intake of the large associations.
The Liga has distributed up to 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (from 12 Spanish) which have been participating in this event since its founding in 1992/1993.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The White Club is located in the third place of Europe, who deserved most of the money by its participation and the only one, next to the AC Milan, who won the trophea.
The official Catalan master and last winner of the former Europecups in 1992 occupies the fifth place.
The list launches Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams, which took their participation in the past Champain League.
And that even though they lost Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries who were able to take money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (fif, in contrast to four by Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious objection is explained by the complex monetary distribution procedure applied by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization whose Presidency Michel Platini has entered is calculated by the Champions League with 1,190 million revenues.
Of this money, UEFA 413.1 million will provide fixed payments: each of the 20 Fužball clubs that took part in the pre-qualified qualification (i.e. atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition to the 550,000 euro for each game they were committed, those who fought to participate were 3.8 million by their blonde presence.
There is also a bonus for profits (80,000 euros) and a difference (40,000 per team). The clubs that have come into the eighteenfinals will receive three million; the four that have come into the quarterfinals, 3.3 million.
The last four will get 4 million each.
In contrast to the second, the winner earns 9 million, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a FWEball club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31,2 million fixed revenues.
Barça again deserved his victory at the European Supercup in August 2,5 million.
However, the variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned still occur.
This money is given proportionally to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 places assigned.
The master of the last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third party and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play in the issue of this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group has passed through details about the purchase of shares, with which it wishes to acquire a limit between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sover.
A percentage which does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In the concreet, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share paying for ten years, with an interest rate of 1 % annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the sos acts concluded with EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa assessed the company 18% under market value.
According to Nuevan Ruma, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group shall give the shareholders a period of 15 days in order to inform their interest in the sale of its shares.
CNMV assured that it was not informed about this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been contacted with the Authority.
In the case of a conclusion, the payment would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos 254,27 million is.
In the meantime, so its management continues to transform.
In the attempt to stay on the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial crossings of his ex-manager, the brothers of Jesús and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book test.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman who has a high post at the food company.
It is a newly created post, which is directly supported by the President of the group.
This is everything else than free from Polemics because the company is processed in a judicial battle because of suspicion of more than 230 million societies to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos is moving further capital during the next months.
With regard to the credit of Salazar yesterday, the ex-advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja) entered before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises the public exclusion award provided by the Investment Company Mer
The National Board Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion invoice for Federico Paternina last 9 October.
The Supervisory Authority stated that it approved this tender after it was demonstrated that the conditions of law are maintained and therefore the content of the submitted leaflet, according to the amendments of the past 2 December, can be considered "providing".
CNMV also informed that this offer is intended to acquire 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7,65 euros per share, which is 8,95 % of the company capital, which consists of 6,142,786 euros in the stock exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
In addition, the Commission noted that 5.592.778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transferred until the end of the tender and whose price was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws of law.
New vehicle evaluation programmes
In these days of accidents and accidents, not only the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day thousands of vehicles that have been developed in an accident will be shipped into the workshops where a reporter must evaluate the damages created and the costs for repair.
No accident is equal, and the calculation of the costs for the parts and working hours can be a long-term and complex task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 300,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, it is a question of minutes with the support of the latest computer tools
Therefore, nearly 100 % of the rapporteurs use this type of systems.
The service providers and application providers for the evaluation of accidents and maintenance shall collect the information they receive by the manufacturers in order to edit them and provide them with their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera group, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are made with their products.
The two other companies compete on the tool market for evaluation and development of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data that the manufacturers make available is everything else than simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, a sales manager of Audatex, is cooperated with 63 manufacturers and importers, providing each of them the information in another format.
The amount of data to be edited will be ever larger until the point that more versions, variants and engineizations have been marketed over the past five years, than in the past.
Once a new car comes on the market, the company starts working.
It is a challenging task, because each individual of the but thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolized and entered its price.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphical image that allows you to "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If it is a lot of sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure is rapidly progressed.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audatex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain with full information.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road-driven vehicle park, it is more than 99%.
The purpose of the implementation of the documentation work and the production of databases has Audatex worldwide over eight (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) distributed centres and each individual of them has specialised on certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually specialists for mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests every year 90 million euros in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use them in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and maintenances, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of screw parts or for calculating the feiling or restoration of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of the use cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
With a view to the products offered by Audatex, you can easily provide an overview of the type of support they give to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products of AudaPlus, a standard solution for the exploitation of accidents for the rapporteurs.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
The costs for the parts shall be calculated by the manufacturer's estimated repair times or the sales prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each advice.
The most expensive it will be for customers who rarely use it up to ten times a month: 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company, which produces thousands of advice, negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and equipment that run it from the mounting band on the basis of the bicycle number.

Cost proposal of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda Valler tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost proposal in just four steps: the identification of the vehicle, the search of the spare part, the creation and creation of a cost proposal.
The easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially in order to convince the older experts, which are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 road cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need to use a computer with Internet connection.
After the model to be identified on the basis of the bicycle number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required replacement part is selected.
The user may include variables, such as the price for working hours, extra charges or discounts, and it can print out the cost proposal and pass on to its customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool to evaluate such as Audaplus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workplace does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool amounts to 350 euros per year, a amount that the customer can pay without any further.
At the time, the company Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional formats.
This is an innovation, waiting for the automatic engineers for a long time, because you can select a door with her for example and then completely turn the picture to view the inside side.
