Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An Irren event where young people are supposed to meet today.
A chapel where the S-Bahn-Tunnel is buryed.
Small gardeners manage the first reason of farmers.
The oldest official map Munich promotes exciting stories at days.
It nervous if maps are not present.
This knows everyone who had to get up already because the car navi showed a green grass instead of a Umgehung road.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlas, an offer from the Geoportal Bayern of State Government, are everything other than present - but therefore very clear.
Especially if you compare it with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the distribution area of Munich.
The digital Bayern atlas is a flickenteppich which is not recognized as such.
In the large map of overview, more detailed cards, called original posts, were developed for cities and communities.
These originated after the Bayern measurement management between 1810 and 1864 and escaped the first measurement of Bayern.
Your client: Napoleon.
Since the spring of 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording Bavarian in order - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops, with the peace of Lunéville, of 9 February 1801, finally departed, were the neighbors today who created the idea of a surface-covering Bayern card.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Office" and thus the Bavarian measurement management.
The original position sheet for Munich is from 1856 and is like any other one on the website of the Bavarian National Library.
The comparison of Early/Today is the city of the capital of the country, the most ambiguous.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is the submission that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was opened 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as Munich City Part.
Today, Subsendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses undersendlings focus around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named only 1878 to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.
Where today the West Park is, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: When zooming up, a smaller map with decent lines and numbers appears: man-written fluid pieces from the so-called "abuse" from which the basic tax was deducted.
Little parcels do not occupy farmers today - but small gardeners of the "Land in the Sun" facility.
A large green area is characterized north of Subsendling.
The Theresien wise, since 1810 stage of October festival, has actually been a meadow in the 19th century and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" in the area of the Au-Haidhausen, but also in large letters "Irren Organise".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with waists.
There, 1858/59, Munich’s circuit event "On the Auer Lüften".
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden led the establishment - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, finished the chains of the so-called irren.
In addition, he has prohibited the staff to apply violence against the insassen," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the event.
For 280 patients, there was a place for the first time, and later was extended to 500 places.
Sometime, this capacity was no longer sufficient for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006 there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatries of Germany.
On the territory of the former Auer Event, young people meet at Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex 1920 and changed him to a youth home with training businesses.
Westernly, the football site of the TSV Munich East, eastern residential homes from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in Architektonic approving the construction of the Irrene event, which was destroyed in the Second World War at bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was marked by 1856 as "Haupt Platz", the buyingingerstraße was "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change made the second world war also in Munich's heart.
The bombs of the Alliated breeds in December 1944 have a lot of holes in the city centre.
A great stay until today - at the Marienhof.
The English institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the pre-works and on April 5, 2017 the stretch for the second S-Bahn-Stam-Tracke took place.
With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the air image of today - and the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promoting of Colours has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri due to discrimination policy and the racist attacks of the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force until August 28, 2017, calls for Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state, and to let extreme caution, as a number of fragile, race-based incidents are present throughout the state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the prosecution authorities of the State, who aimed unrelatively on minorities, allowed the group to release travel warnings, said NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are killed or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sander died in fragile circumstances early in the year, after he had no more petrol during the journey through the state and was taken by the police of Missouri in observation without being accused of crime.
The Council also points to a recent report of the Office of Missouri's General State prosecutor, which shows that 75% of black car drivers in the state are more frequently stopped than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"The people must be ready if it brings bills or let the relatives know that they are traveling through the state."
In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hatred crimes, according to the latest figures in the FBI reporting programme of Hats-Drafts, which qualify the State as regards the number of such injuries to the 16th ranking of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri Act that would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination.
Before that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States adopted immigration laws, the local criminal prosecution authorities are obliged to arrest people because of immigration infringements, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profileling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in the latter time, stakeholders have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Weidezaun Project is basic
The Fischerbache Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the next year.
Peter White and Cordula Kovac have provided a picture on the spot.
At the Supreme Court of the Family of Schwendemann, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-location association met the mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members.
Markus Schwendemann first granted insights in his farm where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forests, 40 milk cows and so many virgin animals and enjoys holiday guests in five apartments.
The "swash forest milk" is for him the alternate marketing route for the milk of his cow, says Schwendemann.
On the table of holiday guests is exclusively regional.
As he was also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project as "elementar important".
I can't economically profitate in such a variety of areas.
The green country area cares for a lot of work, many have to be processed with the engine sensation.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," said Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parental plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not carry out a biological operation.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The Commune recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is glad about the Leader's presentation."
In the case of costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers should be supported.
It is hoped that a long period of time could be taken out the research of the areas.
"The greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and making thought of how they continue their operation," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often in criticism because of promotion
In 2013, 25 parcels of eleven participants were cut over Weidezaun promotion.
The surface shall be 40 hectares, which may not be forsaked up to at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted over Leader, a quarter was the community of Fischerbach.
So the farmers stayed 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of Weidezaun.
"The great advantage is the long-lastingness of the tea," said Schwendemann.
Cordula Kovac stressed: "You are making a good job without farmers and farmers.
Also for Peter White stand firmly: "There are best foods produced".
The Baden-Württemberg Landscape Directive enables the state to promote wheat acids.
The aim is to keep the black forest open.
The prerequisite is one of the support crops referred to by the LPR.
In addition, the infringing area must not be a slopper-based (adhesion over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the inquiry.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 parcels that want to build about 16 kilometers of magnitude.
The open surface corresponds to 35 hectares, which are calculated costs for more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more holy?
Now the White House of Trump takes up the status of freedom
The safest sign of a regime changer is it when they start to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - so the carefully insected sturz Saddam Husseins at the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axt in a heaty dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President to drastically restrict legal immigration with the freedom status.
To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horn of boat owners and liberty ideators had directed him if he had done it.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the significance of her, when the famous poem was added by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the Memorial.
As Miller Acosta said: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the status of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original freedom statue."
Miller is quite right, but as he himself formed it, it is not really history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus’s exciting words, the only one in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your trouble, your poor, / your distressed masses, who are looking forward to breathe freely, / the elender waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time to see the "flanking waste" on our screens better.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict for the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they had done a highly political act.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a classical representation.
Lazarus changed this significance: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she himself gives itself a very different name: mother of exiles.
The link of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nativeism.
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change this long from the right wing.
The Great Schreihal Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Täufer for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the freedom statue is no one, but rather an early Neoconservative that brings the American flames to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.
It is intended to carry the Fackel of Freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The fake should not illuminate the way to the United States."
Limbaugh is unusual here.
The importance of the statue is a whole question of the view of perception.
The great fantasy act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted but hopeful people after long and often terrible travels on the ceilings of ships.
It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.
And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their pillar shall not light the way, but the hatred which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two shots were part of the UK team
The Chief Director of the Lightathletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-popular Scottish quota in the World Championship framework " will pay an enormous contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that "she developed something special in Scotland" and the lightness of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to find out until we find it out," said Black.
"I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Lightathletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal advocates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are to come against Sir Mo Farah on 5,000 m route, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your Captain-Red was incredible," says Black.
"A series of athletes, regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that the olympic had naturally brought were great."
The Commonwealth-Silver Medal winner, who will arrive at its fifth world Championship at the 400m-Hürden, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scottishs are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of atlets at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The Muir subway runs on this route and has established five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1.500 m and 5,000 m runways.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 metres, is another shot that should be observed after a great season that included the victory at the British team of Trials and the Anniversary games.
Doyle remembers her first world Championship when the only other shot was in the team of Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that it is "ornally proud" to the fact that many of its countrymen are not only a team but in some cases also to mix with the medals and finals.
"The special team capitäne is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was also a great honor, but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me, makes it a little special for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the shots belonging to the team.
It only shows how far we got.
And they're here as an established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
What is my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a world championship in the home.
So it is really important to set on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympia Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics about Facebook: Do not apply to a public office if you can't contract the heating of choosers
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it was not long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from inner policy to its political principles.
He smelled the criticism, surely.
But he didn't make his critics silence.
For in 1783 Washington said: "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, foolish and stupid, we will be led to battle like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions from at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties accused him for the beginning of this week.
The steady of the governor dismissed the complaint as free, and the online comment was full of an counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's only Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is surprisingly popular.
He has the secondest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.
He was also very sent in using Facebook as a primary means to connect to his choosers and play his hairless head to chemo therapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come on the side of the governor is a public forum called officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars is unnecessary and finally dangerous.
In a interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trollen or spam or hateful people that force the peitch online.
The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a role.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profant.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Md., was not hatred, but she asked for hatred crime.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current messages," she wrote in the commentary field of the "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea, even if a number of people take position on the same subject, they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's employees referred to as "concentrated spam attack", would probably call others "for language".
The Facebook-Era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times if you had done the same that employees have been sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical guides or to arrest and bring to silence.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official who is criticized for infringing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter Fed.
One of the first miles in this question fell in Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisor of the Loudoun County injured the first amendment, according to the US-Cirk judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voters from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gouverneur Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of prestigious Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers increased between 1776 and 1800, and an anonymous writer put his lead.
And even then Washington had an anonymous role.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and ship ride with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington project's online paper.
But he didn't bring her to silence.
The freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes on a homely comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty is hoping for secret comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organises the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led to the final round in the Archerfield, left to the end before losing against Paul Eales, is connected to the new place of exchanging and operates as a tournament in the name of the association founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he reaches his roam with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, it's in a great state.
Jerry has made a great job when he decided this place.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great show window for this course."
The Engländer Eales is pleased to defend a Championship for the first time, although in his 32-year-old career he won both at the European Tour and in the European Challenge Tour.
"That really feels especially about," said the player secreted in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open because she was taken from the program in the year after I had won it.
Back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place for golfing.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returned to action on home floor.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to make it good, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am happy about how it has gone."
With the trio on the field, the former master winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryd Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottishs on the field, the other are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entry is free, the parking park costs £ 5 per car with an insassen and £ 10 per car with two or more inmates.
All losses go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Less lungs cancer by passive smokes
Over the past two decades, more and less people have died because of passive smoking of lungs cancer.
As a result, scientists from the University of the Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come in a study.
"According to our estimates, there are 167 lung cancer cases per year due to passive smokes," said study manager Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he called on his own study on this subject of 1994.
At that time, there have been 400 lung cancers per year because of passive smoke per year in Germany.
The new investigation was published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in the Villinger Street are in full course and "partly in time," says the head of Fred Heinze Bauhof.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than presumed, as much is hidden in the underground, what was not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic that is constantly disabled by construction works is a major problem for the company Stumpp's construction force.
"The ignorance of the drivers before red ampels and locks is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The street was locked and only the line buses were entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been very exciting.
But happyly, we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei bought the dinner, she doesn't use a herd.
She's just rarely using a pot.
In her wood house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the unruhful Indonesian province of Papua, the house woman usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the chilled knobles are taken and swallowed with excited, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example to wash clothing with dry water from the nearby swamp.
A emmer in a roofless room serves as a Latrine.
As the last four wives of her husband, you were not assigned fields.
Polygamie is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villages are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody is waiting to walk in the village after 17 a.m.," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1.026 elders were to vote through a public hand recording before the crews.
A existing movement launched for independence against the Dutch rule quickly turned against the Government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua, including the independent part of Papua New Guinea, the east part of the island.
Enarotali is as far as it is dead. It includes a 90-minute flight from the province capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour car hire with the car rental.
There are no means of public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo soils, and of wave roofs transformed by rost into different yellow-brown sounds.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here because of journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, May Pago Papuans honored a God called Uga Tame.
There were also other changes.
"We weren't used to wear these clothing," says Degei, depicting on her lively, hand-written tower, her dark shirt and her bright rock.
"For example, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and alphabetization rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 Freeport alone has reduced 3,1 billion US dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wooden resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars.
These empires, however, are a source of an elde for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a delicate presence.
An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military officers and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.
Papuan claims for larger autonomy threaten these golden Gans and are treated gnadenlessly.
According to the facts of activists, more than 5000,000 papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and arrested since 1969 by Indonesian military.
In the 1970s, mass releases in Papuas Stammes Highland became a genocide according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Only in the region, the Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose all" says in a report from the Archdicese Brisbane from 2016, in which reports are included on Groeltates of the previous year, such as unlawful executions and tortures - rape and electros are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, since every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened because Papua's resources bring an influx of coats from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warrants sell wheat and gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable with groundnus sauce.
Local people fight to keep up here.
"The migrants started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market more cheap than the local papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai indigenous, who moved to the province capital of Jayapura.
"It cost the local papua - the Mama Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
During his election campaign in 2014, the Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to address the infringements and injuries in Papua.
The former roomman assured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little changed, and today the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai only left two months after Jokowis Instruction in October.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs before a camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The scared children told them that they should turn their lights on.
One of the soldiers took attack on her sound and later came back with four soldiers, said the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drinked hunted and struck the group with their armies, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so heavy that he fell into the comea.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government Commission was burned and the things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football site in front of the local police station and the military commanding centre to demand justice.
They carried zeremonial yachts and led the Waita dancing - in the circle running and a bird singing imitating - by Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some demons began to sleeve stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses are more than three times resistant, they shoot it," says a official document by TIME that was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of Kego Koto-Viertel by Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and cried for rest and called for the crowd to return home.
No one was listening to the vote.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left handwriting," he said TIME on his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the ball came from the rows of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overfilled, many shots were fired," he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, his cousin, who was witnessing the shootings.
"I ran to him and studied his body to be sure he was it," said Yohanes, who, as many Indonesians, wear only one name, the TIME in dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The head inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers just wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demons were killed and many more were injured.
The news about the killing came to Jakarta 'filterd' on the next day.
Three weeks, Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the victim's families and swore to address the historical infringements in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was introducing an outright mechanism to provide historical human rights infringements.
But the floors almost started immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 90s and early in the 2000s.
The point is that we have been obliged to address these infringements, but there are processes that have to be passed," he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he talked to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he did not have plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "all things are legally regulated," instead.
Weanto, who has accused the UN for "terrorism against humanity", who demanded for more than 1,000 death victims in East Timors bloody independence agreement of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights in papua have already been attached, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai  opponents tackled such claims with fierce unbelievability.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still in fear for years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I have fear of being arrested by the military, fearing to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai fear to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten from the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I had buried the bodies, the military looked for me," he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on village residents in Paniais Neighbourhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between village residents and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man who was drunk in 24 years of Ravianus Douw when he fished in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital.
Reached villagers protested before the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded to it by burning warrants.
But locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the amount and killed a killing.
"We were so in panic, we have feared that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and was witnessing how the injured ones were quickly delivered here, so the TIME.
"I have hidden me two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has invited the officers involved to take account of and withdraw the mobile breach of the police from the territory.
Paniai was always a restoration for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the satisfaction of the family members of May, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highland of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army who claimed to defend Papua's rights by stimulating sporadic attacks and kidnapping Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and randomly arrested in Paniai, under the pretext of the "Section of National Sovereignity".
Some don't get up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as a "a tragic, forgotten place".
poverty strengthens unreasonableness.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locales.
Brot is equally out of range.
People here build everything they eat: especially notes and fruits and leaves.
Agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They keep the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces Nota cost only 100,000 Indonesian Rupies (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs available in the region are usually addressed to the better trained and more prosperous migrants.
Papua has rarely the capital or the necessary capabilities to lead their own companies competitive.
"The young people aren't interested in staying in the village... for there is no job or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Council of the Family of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting of international media are stressed.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were granted the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis were not realized in order to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's ruinous eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua: Visa refuse and a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that the international pressure on Indonesian government is largely limited to the direct neighbours of Papuas.
In March six Palestinian States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the "participating and widespread injuries" in Papua including Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, resigned the prerequisites of the group and said to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to interfere with evidence of human rights."
People locally want more foreign governments to know this.
When a official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human rights bomber Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited on 4 May, locals broke their silence and entreprented him "We want freedom," according to a source that would like to participate in the meeting, but remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua says that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai ships," says Gobai, President of the Council of Family.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai folk, except that it lives under the constant threat of a Raubberian military, is in army education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai-Leute, like other Papua, considers her voice for Jokowi as a "shoe" which he has to pay back.
"You don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
In spite of the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai ship victims have carried out a last symbolic act of despite: the body of a victim was buryed on a ground exactly toward the police and the military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least they don't let the responsible people forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," Yacobus says.
"What else can we do?"
Fire covers the 'Torch' cloud cradzer from Dubai for the second time
A fire found on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meters of high 79-stage buildings.
It is the second fire that flies through the high house in just two years, which is randomly called the torch tower (fackel tourm).
The building was evakuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flames.
"We've been sleeping and we stood up at the fire alarm and when the people were crying.
We ran down the staircase, and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor," told a resident who told his name Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 a.m. local time (0.00 p.m. GMT) had solved fire and cooled the building.
The government said that it was working in the provision of accommodations for those concerned.
The incident can resume questions about the safety of materials used in the outdoor areas of high-houses around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch structure after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from the clothing, the outer clothing for decoration or isolation.
In Britain, the police said that the system of plates could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a fire with about 80 people in June.
No Davis-Cup reform: Next Best or Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed with its large Davis-Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City meeting, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was not supported by the required two-Drittel Multiness.
Although the often very long but also very appreciated five-Satz classics continue to receive the traditional application so.
63.54% of the Member States agreed for reform, therefore, the aim of the ITF President David Haggerty was only briefly missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our members did not accept the entire reform package for Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
You will continue to work in improving the applicants.
Not only for vote, after many claims, had already come before the proposal to post the finale in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: The finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round in the next year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements in matters of training etc. will have to be facilitated and the players will have to finish less official media-mine before Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S.R. brings forbidden items to the aircraft, finds an survey
A survey under air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of the objects consciously or unconsciously prohibited at the control points of the US Transport Security Administration slaughtered over, including at least 6 percent of the aircraft, while they had prohibited measuring or other objects with cling.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had late discovered that they were wrongly traveled with shoes, munition, or vapour.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a Jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also noted that younger travelers were rather disregarded of the rules.
From the requesters who admitted that they knew they were trying to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of millions were compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X.
The most common objects that have been transmitted to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted to have carried items with cling through security control, while 2.2 per cent of women's surveys and 3.7 per cent of the male queries also confirmed that they had definitely brought forbidden drugs to the plane.
The company said that travelers in the whole country had asked to find out how many accidentally smuggling equipment had brought through airport safety and how many had been deliberately doing it.
It is no surprise that the people who wear the best smugglerware - knowly or unconscious - were those who were most often flying.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what fluids they may take or how much of them.
It is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of the items taken by the TSA are forbidden fluids.
For a while people thought that TSA could see books as a smuggling tool.
Flows are allowed for domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk is nonetheless: tens of thousands of Tesla clients cancel order
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is pleased to specify the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
To this end, he has stated that part of the customers has already repealed their unbounded reservation.
In addition to the always triumple figures on sales increases and even more gigantic paragraph targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk first advised another, less glanceful number: the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk had often acquired more than 5000,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just starts.
Now Musk admits: From the total 518,000 prescriptions, 63,000 have already been withdrawn again.
Criticians have always noted that it is merely unverbindlich reservations.
In cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment" completely.
At present, 45,000 such unbounded reservations are present, Musk entered in a telephone conference with analytics.
However, the Tesla-Chef does not believe that the cancellation of some 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge for ambitional growth objectives lies not on demand but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it should be - all models - 500,000, 2020 - one million.
The demand for this is evidently there.
Musk says that there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Anyone today ordering a "Model 3" may expect the delivery of the second half of 2018 - if Tesla creates it to drive its nails, never tested in practice without greater breakdowns with maximum load.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if it comes to greater delays, the indulgence of reservations could become the problem of Tesla.
For then, the company cannot prevent unreasoned customers from walking away in stakeholders.
EPA-Chef Pruitt withdraws to reduce emissions because of the exhaust of the rules of the Obama era.
One day after he had been accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Authority, took his former decision to suspend the implementation of the rules of the Obama-Era to reduce the emissions of smog caused air pollution.
Pruitt presented the change when his Agency demonstrated the needs of the State Environmental Authorities to reactive accelerators as before administrations.
He did not mention the complaint which was raised against his previous body in a Federal Appeal Court.
It is about a period that was due on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-nah ozone.
In June, Pruitt stated that he would go beyond compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid ‘ mixing into local decisions or to hinder economic growth’.
Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump state lawyer of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental legislation.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed to block or fatigue regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden return of Wednesday is the latest legal return for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the EPA manager exceeded its authority when he tried to force the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnover to Ozone standards simply strengthens the willingness of the EPA to collaborate with the States through the complex process of the timely fulfilment of the new standards.
"In earlier administrations, the EPA often did not comply with the deadlines for the implementation and then waited for being accused by activist groups and others, and in agreement to set the date for the implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen time in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority we exist."
Nevertheless, the EPA’s opinion stated that Pruitt will at any time use its "future for delay and all other legally available full powers" in order to ensure that the rules "based on solid policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in the convention urged a more comprehensive revision of Ozone rules.
A draft law approved in the last month is intended to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years.
The measure has not been voted in the Senat.
The New York Advocate General State Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the States who had accused the EPA this week, said that the group decided to maintain the legal pressure.
"The return of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the Smog flowing into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the district of Columbia.
The soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refiners, chemical plants and other sources of the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The smog may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute every year to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of the public health system and the environmental protectionists rejoiced by pruitt’s surprising course change.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step from the responsible for protecting the air we are inhaling," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological cross-section of the Trump government to offer themselves to environmental mudlers and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the jubilee of the Bergkirche is invited to the old Cemetery Areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 16.30 p.m. to a Serenade.
Whether his idyllic location and beautiful views on the village, the historic St. Hilarius site is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be decorated by this powerful place.
The restoration and maintenance of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and supporters of tumbling their concerns.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique charm."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergn original book: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the subsequent parish church at Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
The text of the doctrine after standing on the Tumlinger Berg, except the once-year church, was also a magnificent court to which the church or the patronate law belonged and not reversed.
So people lived there.
As revealed from the description of the Chair Office of 1858, the "Berg" of the third, the magnificent town of the village, was next to the subdorf and the upper village, which is still to be seen today in the village image of Tumlingen.
Old maps from the time around 1600 undermour these historical events.
The patronate law originates from the early Middle Ages' own church law.
A Lord who built a church, preferred and occupied with a priest, continued to keep Oigner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
Thus the right was to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
Three altars were in the church and two bells on the tower.
The sizer of the two scattered at Christmas 1673.
The newly created glocket then appeared first in 1692, but the second world war later had to be released in 1942.
In the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648) the window slides were stealed and the bell sails were stolen.
The roof was low.
==References====External links==*Official website
They broke out the candle and church chairs and used as a firewood.
Overridden of the church threatened in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last tranquillity for the dead from hearingschweiler.
The church was extended in 1823 and the Hilarius church was canceled.
Only the church tower was left to stand.
In the New Year night of 1834 a storm split the tower and half crashed.
To prevent an unglück, the tower was aborted.
Only today's tower was given as a witness of the 750 - year - old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are the successors of Dieter Dockhorn.
As an organizer, the friends and supporters invite Tumlingens on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade at the Old Cemetery at the St. Hilarius Capelle.
This is formed by the Kepler-Gymnasium Freude centre and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 16.30 p.m.
Instalment is at 15.30 p.m.
For the end of the Serenade, a retreat will take place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view of meadows to the forest," the organizers express the fantastic view.
The Serenade will only take place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to maintain the historical St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumbles and listeners.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly obliged to live home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to verify the approval of wind wheels
"Boisheim refuses" does not see a legal prerequisite for construction and has therefore turned to the Board of Land.
The Boisheim Association has called for Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to reduce its approval for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was legally infringed.
The association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, the Boisheimer's net could not have been authorized any wind power plants at all, since at the time in Foursen only a wind power concentration zone had existed at the city border at Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind energy plants are essentially possible, but at the same time the concentration zone has an exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining city area.
The zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
Although the city of Foursen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, a few days earlier, through a change in the area of use plans – which, however, had not approved Düsseldorf District Government because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning, the approval decision granted continues to remedy and therefore also," said Christoph Erkens, President of "Boisheim refusing himself".
Current state of things: The Council of City has once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; the government's approval is still out.
Recognition: "Thereby, the provision of a approval for the establishment of wind energy plants is therefore excluded legally".
The circle confirms the entry of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been entered to the foursen circle last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes it for the occasion to review the matter again.
They do not expect that the procedure will be stopped.
With a view to running procedures at the administrative court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express its argumentation on the Boisheim association.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plants on an area at the Boisheimer Nette, the construction of four per 200 meters high windcycles.
Last year, the company in which the city of Foursen is centrally involved had closed pacht contracts with the owner of the about 65 hectares of large territories.
The four wind energy plants are designed to cover the electricity needs of around 11 400 households, which corresponds to a fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest about 20 million euros.
Last summer, Foursen's City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich at Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and trainer screw together: Woman dies in terrible accident
One terrible traffic accident has occurred on Friday at 10 p.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Krise).
A woman was injured fatally.
Two more people were easily injured.
The national road was locked over hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich took her car in the context of the accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as a companion the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and dealer plan "Heimat-Shoppen" weekly
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are supposed to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city of the city in September.
The commercial club and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lock the inhabitants to the city's shopping bummel.
As the chairman of the Business Association, Christian King, announced, the "Hoppen-human" is supposed to be sensitive to the customers for which offers the city is available from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, home firms should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, businesses of the city are intended to invite the "midnights-Shops".
The action aims not only to residents of the city and to the vicinity of the region.
In preparation, Werbespots are in the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the Action Weekend, says Christian King.
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the industrial and commercial chamber.
Thus, the commercial club and the city go to another stage of the project "Attrative Interior City".
These include new offers such as the first "activ-day" to the fountain feast as well as sales open Sunday, conversations with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and loss of parking fees this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is intended to be re-established or further.
These include Kurgages and tourists.
But also many local people would have lost the city's interior from shopping.
At the end, all should help to live the city centre - to avoid, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It was valid to overcome the lethargy with a network that made partly widespread, King had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK center in Mühlhausen, shared that the third day of "Heimat-Shoppen", first participating in five thüringer cities.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Holy City and Bleicherode.
The day was to "improve the value of local trade and make its importance more exposed to the community of our cities", says strike.
The action under the Federation of the IHK and with many partners also made it clear that each citizen with its purchasing behaviour can affect its direct environment itself.
Two dead and several injuries after explosion on US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more have been injured, some of them hard.
According to the fire war on Wednesday (local time) was still a injurious infringement in critical state.
One man died when a part of a school building crashed at the explosion.
A first prosecutor was later also held to death.
The dead were the employees of the school.
As a accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the holiday, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put under pressure for the payment of the border walls according to through-speaked transcripts of telephone calls Mexico
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump called on a phone office with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him because he had publicly charged the walls. Reports he said to him, "You can't say the press."
Trump started his presidency campaign with the promise of establishing a wall at the southern border of the U.S. and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an excited exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States refugees who went out to Australia was to take "slow," "my" and "domm" and that the existence of trade given by the Obama government would let him look like a "depp" after prohibiting a ban on the relocation of refugees to the USA.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massager: Activists bring racist Lynchact back as a call for justice
A Ford Mercury in 1948 went through a group of viewers in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumpeled to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns came to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a man of middle age in a needle strip approximation - took a long train on his cigar and looked examined by the wind protection disc.
There are the inmates in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" braved the man.
"Have him out of the car!"
Screaming the silence when a young black man was deteriorated by the rider seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that was played on July 22, is only a record.
But when a snippet is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all in the audience came out very real merger.
Since 2005, civil lawmakers come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were directed by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been accused of murder.
"It is really unfascinable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see it in our communities even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps the organization of the recording.
"It's a dirty flaw on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old assemblieser of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil lawn.
For him it is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice was never corrected.
"We want punishment, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to receive justice," he said.
"We cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A court medicine puts a tuch on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on July 27th 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding municipalities were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although the suspects have been staying free for decades, civilians say that the double motivation for the Lynch action throughout the city was always known: Politics and Sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the first time to vote at the pre-elective campaign in the summer.
Within the same time as the election, according to information from the Black Farmpächer Roger Malcom, a white base owner, Barnett Hester, was down during a battle - supposedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the smell in the city had been that Hester had sleeped with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white land owner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, says the FBI.
He was associated by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they removed from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it reveals, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," concludes a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a compromise between the government and local prosecution that was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and the identity of witnesses."
Brook's forming it more pregnant.
"It was a voting right massacre," he said.
"They have been killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you can register and when you vote, you will happen here."
Approximately a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual design of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their presentation is illuminating, fascinating, and is founded in a kind of deep racism, of which many want to believe that he does not exist in America anymore.
It is hard to look, and to look out more difficult, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynchen because we're then faced with its warmness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or hear what I've done."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - started in a room and laughing when Greene started a well played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-Regisseur.
He has been playing the role of the head clan member for years but he said that the role would never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not so," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to get this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who crys up and disturbs him, angry that he had sleeped with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a break.
And every one (at least all the black actors) is exposed to laughing.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still shy.
"I just don't think that white people said 'n --- he' at that time."
"Doch," one of the other black showers was married.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And exactly there, the energy in space shifts, a feeling of cameraship replaces inhabited.
Everyone is busy to get this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people who are killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-Wort, he says it sharply and with impression.
Nobody's laughing.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There's crying, shots and then silence.
A woman, clothed with a grief dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and leads Billie Holidays wrestling Lobrede "Srange Fruit".
Their voice steadfasts at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind a group of about four dozen viewers sweat and tears out of the eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided between Black and White.
A couple traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down only the street.
They have experienced all almost eight hours of Georgia’s pressing humidity when Brooks leads her to Malcoms and Dorsey's graves on a pilgrim trip.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now when you are on the same country where the Lynch killing takes place, the air feels splendid.
When the last notes of the song fail, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children hack on their heads, register the false blood and the silent body and flush each other.
"You aren't really dead," murmured a little boy, as if he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greens thank the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the Lynchseil away and intervene their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the tract played by the Clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his competitors and then breaks together into her arms, the emotional load of the performance finally breaks through him.
"It's okay," fluisters one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience collaborates with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta stimulated about the formation with a black couple that they just learned.
Denise Duplinski was fighting to find words that have left the performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What's really doing with me, let me believe that the Lynchen is still going on," she added, "but it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brook's court holds on his table, eating and reminding the citizens' rights.
He said he already started planning the performance in the next year.
"The formation is in some way inspiring, because it describes the fears of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's when we learn nothing about it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat it."
"Good dammering" succumbed the carnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also puts on a colorful-fresh inszenation of the Guigantian, six-stage culisse.
The turnbown (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a elective street corner with wall rest and dunerbude in Berlin, a "Plast and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York stock exchange.
Before, an open Mercedes old-timer, where the Rhine seekers are positioning as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Arranged oil vessels remember Castorf's Guidemotive - Money, power and gir - which draws itself through his "Ring" inszenation.
The three Rhine seekers - sing by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess deceives Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), breaks a body in Hollywood-Manier into the case room and give the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the magnificent pigs surrounded by the Aura of a heavy-weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he hit Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) still has to believe.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Sturmic celebrations are formed by Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski, who forms modest and hands to the Merkel-Raute.
The festival orchestra, which first shows at the stage, is a great case for the first time in view of the great heat again in the military recreation clothing.
With tension, Frank Castorf and his regime team were expected.
When he had to have left a valid pepper concert in 2013, there were five years later great jewels in which the unified "buh" rubbish went.
Festspielchef Katharina Wagner may have rejoiced about it.
"You noticed that the audience has grown together with the "Ring" in a certain way," she said just before the dpa performance.
The audience did not only make a form of peace with Castorf, but it was also a sense of understanding.
I'm seeing a positive resüme.
Max Quantity works as volunteers
They work in their voluntary year equal to several places.
Where else?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture stock, once in the week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have already worked on school in the open day.
How are your experiences?
Quantity: It's a beautiful wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late volunteers.
How's that?
Quantity: I made Abitur.
And then a construction engineer study, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized it's wrong for me and I want to make something different to work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is local, perhaps in the burning point.
And was it like that?
Quantity: I've collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my social study in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably at Herne’s youth Office, and I'll study at Hamm at the special school.
Is it not something unusual to have several locations of use during voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it's very varied.
It's always about where you're doing your FSJ.
It can be done from age to youth work – in all possible factors of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me this was exactly the right thing I traveled.
I could recognise my own strengths and see how it really runs off.
Unlike the construction engineering study?
Quantity: In fact, this is not how to calculate statistics.
You have always formed other people, each has a very different story.
Whether a refugee whether a youth who has been taken out from the family - you must always enter it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touching fears?
Quantity: I am not the type for that.
There's an area that is a lot.
Great love, a lot of friendliness.
There are even negative moments, but so life is just.
Pearson shorts further 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to resume the business
The British Education Group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediaries by 72 per cent, since another restructuring programme is started to overcome the pressure that the company has been faced.
In addition to its previous restructuring in which 4.000 jobs have been lost, the job reduction, Director John Fallon, who announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan of more than 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) in order to re-establish a business taken by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, who had declared his participation in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2,05 billion pounds in the first half year.
Convoic attack by Kabul: Nato-Soldat killed in suicide attack
A suicide of suicide attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a soldier of Nato, and hurt several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and a interpreter were injured, told the Nato.
In the Qarabagh district there were three civilians who died in the event of the Qarabagh local reports.
The bombarding is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Kabul.
On Monday, a suicide adventure killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
The Nato opinion states that the explosion had happened on Thursday evening when a common patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised sponge of persons".
The statement indicates that all injured persons are in a stable state and are treated in the American Military Hospital at Bagram airport.
According to codes, the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic state (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for the NATO drops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in Afghanistan, there were at least 1.662 civil death victims in the first half of 2017, about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide autobomber killed at least 30 people in a most important district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had done this attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombarding in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack of the country, since the US-leaded forces in 2001 endured Taliban from power.
Violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering to increase the number of US forces to support military and police in the country.
In recent weeks, the suicide adventures in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies and in particular the call of President Ashraff Ghani.
EPA turns decision to delay the Smog Rule to complain
The U.S. Environmental Authority has a decision to suspend the rule of the Government of Obama, which the States are obliged to integrate the Smog-sufficiency emissions, which took place one day after 15 states accused the Agency for the step.
The EPA announced the decision in the late Wednesday to forward the so-called "Ozone provisions 2015" and said that it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and not that we respond to our state partners," said EPA-Chef Scott Pruitt in a declaration.
In June, Pruitt announced the aim of the EPA to measure the ozone provisions in which a part of the country's pollutant emissions should be measured in order to determine where cuttings must be made to maintain more strict air quality standards, to reduce a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the Colombia District, entered a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental records that the former President Barack Obama has set up as part of a wider agenda, which, according to Trump, is to turn on economic growth.
However, the efforts have triggered the return of democracy and natural protection groups, which cause concerns about the effects of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the inhalation of air, which contains ozone, "covers the lungs function and can increase breath symptoms" such as as asthma.
Community Council wants Community area
At the end, the decision was clear: in two votes, the Council of Fluorn-Winzels decides to set up a Community room in the future senior residential plant.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the property was signed, reports the mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take place until the area belonging to the church community is owned in the municipality, there is no more planning obstacle to the project to be agreed by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area for this.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the municipality.
On the ground floor he would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters surface for a special price.
The administration and majority of the Council of the municipalities suggest that such a Community area should not only be provided for for the residents of the senior-righteous residents but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word of the "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which has already been different in the past autumn through the provision of funds for the current budget, has been taken into account.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a Community area, Tjaden reports that 60% of 30% would be promoted.
The proposal provides for a signal to the investor that in this respect we do not want to throw a clope between the legs, the statement suggests that both seats - which has been rejected to the environment - and Puldach - which would be possible to reduce the level of train and make construction more economically possible.
Unnecessary, it's not just Wilfried Sohmer, is this addition.
If it's helping, unanimously, he's happening the body.
It is not so simple to the Community area.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many of the own buildings with which you are not right forward, for that one now leave from the window in the community, she says: "I do so hard."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely speaking for the Community area, but it is absolutely against a local participation.
She looks at a covered subsidie without any hazardous or even outward investors.
This is not the case because there is no grant with the acquisition of the area but a real, in any doubt marketable countervail, is the counterparty.
The application for the decision-making proposal shall be found in three favourites.
Thus it remains with two counters in the original program that Stefan Haller summarizes: "If we take the decision so, we make a huge step forward to close a giant gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Radler is slided on the street
On Wednesday, a 82-year-old cyclist has been recorded by a car in Garath and was severely injured.
As the police said, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on the road to Hilden, with his bicycle on the road to the black road.
The Senior wanted to cross the road at the Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the long fields went on the road, however, he apparently did not respect the contradiction.
He came together with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was slipped on the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a truck.
FC Bayern Munich must rely on David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba must make the game sause against Dortmund.
With staff care, the FC Bayern is traveling to the first game of the new season to Dortmund.
Seven professionals lack the title defender in the Supercup against the Pocal Sieger.
Personal care at the German football director Bayern München will be increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also rely on David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
The Munich Manuel New, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are also missing.
For the five precipitations in the last six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team's game responsible.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti and added, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official duty of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualitys.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "swore, intense game".
The duel of the two German soccer heavy weights pulls the fans into their banners.
The party is sold out with 81.360 viewers, and the German football Liga (DFL) shared on Friday.
Walk in the harz of star to star
In the Harz, the boundary is intended to create first star path.
These plants the Association Starwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
A planet path is available in Göttingen since 2003.
A "star path" comes to the need for information of many Harz visitors, said it.
He connected nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and star images.
In a first phase until 2018, the association "good accessible installations at five to six locations" plans in the upper resin.
Inquiry for St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, High Giant and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the star path should be expanded to move.
"On the star path, the viewer experiences a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," said the association.
Moreover, they learned why stars had different colors or why a star illuminated more light than another, although it was much further away.
It is also meant in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see.
Since 2014, the association has been the highest star-wart northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is according to information by the Federal Ministry of Nature Protection to the six darkest regions in Germany.
Frequently, from there the Milky Street and even the Andromeda galaxy with mere eye are clearly seen.
Since 2003, the Planetarium Göttingen Association has been initiatived in the Uni-Stadt, something similar to the planned star power - the planet path.
Beginning before Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inside of our solar system, the planet path leads up to the Hainberg and to the star-wave - as well as a "outerird" location in Diemarden (to the end of the same) with the planet Sedna.
The sets with the individual planet - including the degraded Pluto to the Twelve Planet - are precisely established in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
So the earth shrinks on a ball of 6.5 millimeter diameter, while the exact 75 meters of the sun miss 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet path is four kilometers away.
While the light from the sun to the pluto needs about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to set with Pluto.
So footgangers are faster than the light in the world.
But the Marsch to the next fastster would last half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lo makingko meet themselves for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lo makenko and Mikey Garcia, who should stand in a collision course to inszenate the most exciting box camp in the near future under 147 pounds on Thursday for the first time.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN-Büros in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the uncovered World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down to the Flur to welcome Lo makenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcias Sieg by unanimous decision on the former Four-Division World Championship Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the Top Five Pound For Pound List.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you doing, Champion?
I wish you a lot of happiness."
Lo makingko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple positioned for photos, Lo makingko manager Egis climates noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I am a former spring weight," Garcia remembered.
"I grew up for sources [on 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he must move on lightweighters [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them that."
Lo Makingko agreed.
"Boxs need this fight."
Climates asked whether it should be pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lo makingko has to fight with a 135 pound debut this year, to agree with Garcia a date (37-0, 30 Knockouts) in the next summer, which also has interest in the fight against Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after its lightweight title campaign in the Forum on 23 September.
"This struggle could take place in the Pay-per-View mode because all fans had asked him," said Garcia, and later pressed openly to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other name can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lo makingko as a "a great fighter" and may be participating in his Saturday campaign.
But Lo makingko held at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-campagne Champion from Riverside is slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted to see the co-off."
Garcia said that he was focusing on showing pressure strength then boxes.
Both said they could feel the moment for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lo makingko said, "I waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injuries by mature spacers
In the case of an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people have been severely hurt.
After first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost the control of his vehicle at 16.30 p.m. shortly before the connection point marketbreit.
The car slew right into the floor, where he was overflowing and then on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were sometimes severely injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured people through the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour, and then the traffic on the left rice on the accident site could be passed.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Dry chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 to the seasonal task against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue will bring points.
With the first season game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result also, wouldn't have been the two counters at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"They were two counterparts too much, and we need to watch even better in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defense player.
In the arzgebirge, the three chains are to be further optimized.
And a gate after a volunteer, the fortunes don't want to enter.
"For the future it will be so that no more besides Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that after the experience in preparation with the Trinal Chain, his team is better managed than with the four chain.
"Noch I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have in the three chain at half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well," said Hoffmann.
"Forecast is, but that we are better harmonising and we do not afford so many errors of play."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"If you can speak after a distinction of a failure start, don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," said Hoffmann.
"When we are standing with four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the pocal, we will certainly be able to talk about a nice season event."
His trainer didn't want to know about that.
"The start in the season, I judged only after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who wouldn't want to talk about an advantage to Aue, only because the game of Sachsen in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely because of an unwetler.
"Now they can start the season quasi with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that the players from Aue may even be a little fresher because they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rise in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are now," says the interior representative of Fortuna.
Although guests go out of Rheinland as a lighter favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the final (fast) completed stadium of Aue.
"That we're away from them only because we're entitled to come under the first six, Bloodsinn," says Funkel, whose balance is very positive at just one deposit against the Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which you need to beat from before," Fortuna's head coach explains.
"To meet such a statement would be arrogant and excessive."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his player on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum evaluation tests published
The latest results of asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rätt Medicinal Verket) has started carrying out the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of age more precisely after the Swedish migration authority (migration deck) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were less years old.
Until today, migration package 6.880 has sent to testing cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017.
In other 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "possibly is under 18 years old".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are constant during the last months.
"We do not see a big difference in the statistics of last months, the figures are quite constant," he said The Local magazine.
The high share of cases in which the person has been assessed over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum applicant has lying over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases, the " proposals that the examined person were 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical auction, in which X-ray records of clothing and MRT records of knees that are then analyzed by dentistry and radioologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A creator is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Carolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they went through the puberty earlier or later.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that the kind of measurement should be used.
The biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't surely say it, we should not do as if we could,' he said the Metro newspaper.
Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low.
The largest risk is when the person is just below 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Fully in Plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg comes well.
On Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the east entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in time, it runs super," says Reinhold Light, Construction Director at the Department of Roads and Transport in the Government Presidium Freiburg.
In April, the work began at all three needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building is intended for October and easy to ensure that the schedule will be maintained.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a wool bridge from concrete, which is clothed with red bunt sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
She was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come to the years.
In order to ensure the strength and safety of transport, the three buildings will now be thoroughly reduced.
The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built from red bunt sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and twelve, including 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the town entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 meters wide on Wednesday morning and seven tonnes of heavy so-called bridge hood.
This is a edge fixing which is also used as a operational path.
At the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meters wide bridge hood will be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian should go.
It is particularly important that it is complete parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already renowned with the patented bridges.
Special finger tips required the shift of directions through the construction work in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fiber cable that is connected to many companies.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by handsets about the project.
In addition, fish and cancer first had to be fed.
For the bridges between the building building and the collector towards Schramberg, traffic is singlely regulated by an ampel.
The road in the area of the bridge at the Lauterbach village is fully locked for the construction work on the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden".
The costs for the three bridges are 700 000 euros.
Finance is the whole country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German Kartoffelsalat
It doesn't happen so often that parties are pulling out, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise only difficult to bring under a hat.
The parties represented in the district day of Vulcaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greene, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad bond that shows peaceful flag on this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteine Town Hall Rondell invites the "great election campaign" according to the "great election campaign".
And well-known names begin – like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top-ending duo for the Bundestagswahl on September 24, and the deputy Bundespräsident Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the beginning of the event want not to listen to the Afd teachers but demonstrate.
The motto "The iron remains colorful."
Originally, the city penick was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain site, but now takes place at the parking lot below the Roundel – and thus directly before the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colorful picture that offers.
And what Christa Karoli, President of the Forums A world and one of the relevant organizers, is very pleased: "But how many people have come together here."
There are music and any amount of food, including a "urdeutsch potato salad, which could also eat the AfD problemlessly", says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, showing presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the events sites.
How did the Afd actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD Vulkaneifel, he tried to get such an event and get the access.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked Daun, but got an absage there because of the already built-up tours there were not enough parking spaces available.
So now the Rondell, Hompes rejoices that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
With a view to the event at Rondell's court, he says: "This is the right of people, main case, it remains peaceful."
This is the case: at 20 p.m. there is a band for entertainment, in the town hall of various speakers, including the Rheinland-Pfälzische AfD President Your boy.
In the hall, about 200 listeners are waiting for the Chair, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy Bundespräsident Beatrix of Storch keep their speeches.
The police site is unchanged, but the officials had a quiet evening.
Somewhat more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the front site have a longer breath, but also there is just after 21.
The police can retire - no special events.
Posaune meets Trompete
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is available in the range of Haslacher Kloster concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 a.m. in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian Trompeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Forest" or "Balcanfolklore", he also meets a classic German training with roots in the blast music.
Both soloists are winners and prizeträgers of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
So is Petkov Solotrompeter at the well-known concert building Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments but also to melt the limits of the different Genres.

This core piece of the programme was first launched this spring with huge success in Freiburg.

Kristen Stewart speaks about its bitexuality
"One people love grilled cheese and will eat him until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything," said Kristen Stewart quite openly about their bisexuality.
"When I once bite in a cheese, I think, "Oh that was cool, what's coming next?"
The most well-known relationship of Hollywoodstar was the one with her "Twilight" clothing Robert Pattinson, who lastly was bitter.
Despite all this, the brünette performer assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was very familiar with any that I had dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and believed it seriously.
So it has never confused me or disabled me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously."
In particular, she suffered "Bang Showbiz" according to "Bang Showbiz", but in school time, when she was rather dressing like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me, I would look like a bub.
I really felt attacked, scared and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think of me, "May be proud of you!"
Especially the public, they do not like to explain their love life: "The people expect you to keep yourself in a certain way and that is angry with me.
And maybe some call me as unthankful, but I don't like to justify me before all the public."
The governor of West Virginia announces that he alters the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like or not, the Democrats have removed from me," said governor Justice.
"Heyday I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore when I am a democratic governor."
The communication broke out in a jealousy.
"I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a trainer I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes the only billionaire in the state, was chosen in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business by his father.
It's worth $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee stated on Thursday evening: "The change of the party of governor Justice is another strike for a democratic party that would stop us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governances and controls of the least legal bodies in history, the announcement of governor Justice is only the last refusal of a party that is from above to below and is not able to find a positive, certain message," said the RNC President Ronna McDaniel in a declaration of CBS News.
Coe praises "ehrful" Russian excuses for Doping Scanal
The world leader of the Leichtathletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as a public excuse from Russia as a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into the sports.
Russia's Leichtathletik-Chef Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress at the front of the Lightathletic World Championship that the banning of his country was correct from sports and that he decided to fight the doping.
He said that he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snatched off at competitions of gold and silver medals".
In spite of his comments, the IAAF Conference agreed for maintaining the ban related to it in November 2015, after a report from the World-Anti Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of stately promoted doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe said the reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire convention were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized with itself that she had experienced some very hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is being redesigned."
Coe said that he was also "frequent" about the acceptance of Russia's criteria for re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this was not the moment to reset Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything in the next months to normalise this situation.
The guide principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will join the Lightathletic World Championship that starts on Friday in London after the strict IAAF criteria as neutral actors.
The head of the IAF-Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a reset.
Drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Tradact for in Mali crashed soldiers
At a grief celebration in the northern franchlar, about 1000 people of the two thought of a helicopter abstract in Mali.
The Zeremony took place on Thursday in Domstadt under high safety arrangements.
For unclear crash cause, the Defence Minister Ursula said nothing of the Leyen (CDU).
But she called the two killed pilots as "coons of her expertise".
"We noise before this highest victim they brought on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stab's headman from northhessen were killed on Wednesday for a week in Western African Mali.
Their Särge was transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a wake of the Federal War to the Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter.
At the beginning of the afternoon only the members took aside in the Church.
After that, the grief celebrates began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Federal War and politics.
Hesse Minister President Volker Bouffier (CDU) and General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker were among them.
Mystery guests lay down Roses, the family standing arm in arm on the särge.
Before the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister of the Leyen called the killed soldiers as "high decorated" and intellectual.
The head of the Stab had built up the flight operation of the Chief Chief Chief Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger poles of his regime.
Also Volker Bauerachs, Communicated door of the regime, to which the soldiers belong, said: "If this crew couldn't turn away the crash, then no one would have made it".
Questions about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of Leyen: The use is dangerous.
But he was also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the sad celebrations, the barriers were brought out of the Dome.
When and where they are repealed, the Federal War had no information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be repaid after his death next to his wife.
This shared the king's house on Thursday.
Traditionally the Danish king’s pair is set up in the Domkirche of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already finished a sarcophag for the two.
The queen agreed with her husband's decision, it continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be contributed in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a heal that he wasn't happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would like to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also deposited the title "Prinzmahl".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted to see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby explained the Chief Speaker of the Danish King House.
Where the last tranquillity of the 83-year-old will be final, is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be contributed in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he worked over the last 50 years.
Margrethe in 1965 had learned in London, the poor Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French adel's family.
He worked at the Themse in the French Embassy.
While his later wife always flew the people’s sympathy detections, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 - year rainship at the Danish.
In a autobiography, Henrik expressed over the first years in Denmark, "Mountary months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was scarcing, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk straps instead of stricksocks, Citroens instead of Volvo, Tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia-Tabak and had the reputation to be the brand of social critical intelligence, I could not hope for care.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
They were the same two mistakes!"
Minister-president For rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Niedersachsen
After the loss of the red-green government majority, Niedersachsen's President Stephan Weil (SPD) is for a rapid new choice of the country day, but he does not want to return.
Because, on Friday, the Parliament's resolution spoke.
Previously, the surprising exraise of a Green-Deputy from its country-day Fraction in Niedersachsen had crashed the Government of President Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country's election, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its tangible one-stimmen multitude in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green-Deputy Each West justified its step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in their election in Rotenburg (Wumme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Group Chief Björn Thümler recommends his group to record them.
Thus CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Dutch country day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far the ratio was reversed.
The new Country Day is usually chosen on 14 January coming year.
Thumler said that the red-green national government should now decide whether they could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it indispensable that the country day as soon as possible decides its self-resolution.
The CDU Group will probably decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The national Constitution also provides the possibility of the country's day of trust to the President of the Minister and chooses a follower.
"Our Constitution offers multiple options.
These possibilities must be legally investigated," said Thumler.
"All questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally tested."
Thumler called Twest's step "but something kurios".
The Politician himself stressed: "I am not a betrayer.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a supporter of Black-Green.
The Greens called upon the absorption of the Members to return their country's mandate.
"We, of course, assume that she returned her country's mandate, which she received over the green national list, with immediate effect," the country Chiefs Meta Janssen-Kuz and Stefan Körner shared.
The Group chairman of the Green Anja Arrow said: "We regret the decision of every West".
She has decided to not have a debate in the Group.
"Before the background that there was no content differences, we cannot comply with this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the surpassion of the Dutch Green-Deputy Every West to the CDU as a treacher.
"The behavior of the former Green-Deputys in Niedersachsen is not only treasury to the voters and voters, but also Verrat in Red-Green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supports the decision by President Stephan Weil (SPD) to re-elect the country day.
The western exit costs the majority of Red-Green in Lower Saxony.
The Politician set "in her injuriousity and in her frustration their personal interests for the well-being of the country," criticized SPD Secretary Hubertus Heil.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony takes this dirty intrigent game and tries to strike political capital".
Niedersachsen's CDU Group Chief Björn Thumler recommends his Members to take every west into the CDU.
The Group Chief of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, forbids Twests to discard the result of the 2013 country's selection of land with personal careers.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, SPD and Greene had a humid majority of a vote on the country day.
Minister for Agriculture in interview - How do we protect ourselves from gifts, Mr Schmidt?
Germany talks about neglected eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect.
Agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and answers in interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the steal pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.Libensmittelwarnung.de, the states shall submit the latest information on the eggs concerned.
Any affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know currently, a healthy hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the declare is not really observed by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs?
Food monitoring is a task of the Federal States.
However, my house has immediately been set up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the notices of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available for consumers.
The trade has as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are transportable and healthy inconspicuous.
If an egg exceeds the maximum residual content of 0,005mg/kg, it is not capable of transporting.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and distorted.
This time not the businesses are guilty.
Does production companies and consumers sit in the same boat?
According to the current knowledge, production companies do not make a direct debt.
They must rather expect economic damage due to mutatisfactory illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too little controls in serious cases.
Does it only miss in personnel or in the clever jurisdiction?
It was just the official controls that have detected the process.
However, the truth also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent.
This is why a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to national lawyers is crucial in cases where crime can be made.
I have already made it clear that I expect from the responsible authorities a luckless statement.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumer women and consumers have the right to receive exclusively safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food economy, consumers are rightly disadvantaged.
By means of the harmful means, manufacturers, distributors and consumers have been in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
The legal use of insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of food supply animals is not acceptable and must be completed immediately.
It must be consistent with all levels and worked with high pressure.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the situation is clean and lucklessly clarified.
How to affect the financial rules of the football on Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European soccer associations will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, because the governing organization that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions-League-Turnier.
Financing Fair Play Rules, which have been called by UEFA in 2011, meant that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without great losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money locker so that Neymar can sign and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team through the energy-rich ruler family of Qatar.
Associations may use a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but with legitimate intake sources that allow them to take the Break-Even point in their soccer-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations who had taken up enormous debts in their pursuing success were effectively betrayed and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdraw their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.
The change meant that the business model, originally used by Roman Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand, should become a harder issue.
During the current three-year-old FFP marketing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can increase losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen by the Presidency in Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to approve of excessive expenditure.
"Securely, FFP is not dead, and we will still strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, responsible for the UEFA for FFP, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a breakdown, it can distribute the amount for the accounting on the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that for the next five years, the total of EUR 44.4 million can be issued in the annual conclusion.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, located in the possession of Manchester City, with the most difficult sanctions.
The PSG received a penalty of 60 million euros (when 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions-League of the 2014/15 season are limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlook their financial oversight by exposing their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catargic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring exceeds the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered this as legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of the PSA was recorded by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the Organisational Committee of the WM 2022.
But PSG and Katar 2022 have ordered that Neymar will become WM bombers and that such a manoeuvre could be easily found for the UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more careful to observe every attempt to deal with the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition of anonymousity, as they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with an revenue of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandise and tricot sales.
The association assumes that the turnover after signing will rise by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish Liga was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's journey by claiming PSG to hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to Katar's final ownership to PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sport dycoon, shares the preservative of La Liga against a state that finances a association.
"It is the consequence of ownership, and this has completely changed the whole landscape of the football over the past 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial Fairplay because you can walk different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new choggi supplier
In recent years Chocolat Frey Bord-Schokolade has produced for the Swiss.
Now it stands close cooperation before a possible end: The airline re-establishes the order.
Swiss-speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the Friday newspaper "Nordwest-west-west".
In accordance with the current planning, Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and undergoing a quality control.
"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied," said the speaker.
Approximately 17 million small red-weiss packed choggi tables to 14 grams each year distribute the air passengers before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss didn't want to make any information about the costs.
Brancheninsider appreciates the volume of orders according to Northwestern to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the migros tours achieves an annual sales of around one billion franc.
But important is the advertising effect: For a choggi manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
As many applicants are there in the new tender, the Swiss don't want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract over the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not accessible for an opinion.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate caves on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago, Swiss launched cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-term flights, customers of the First Class are contaminated by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class wet passengers Schoggi by Lindt and in the Economic Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi also distributed on the short track of Chocolat Frey, both in business and in economic class.
Lightathletics - Discus Olympicist Robert Harting reaches WM-Finale
The three-time World Championshiper is fighting for a medal on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympiaseger in 2016, was failed in the national WM decision and was able to look at the discus-continuous warfare only from the Tribüne.
At the same time with the first attempt, the Polish leader Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far for the final campaign.
Nostalgie goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
At the same time, this history is nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90-year-olds-Grunge-Era (as the predators David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch-Comödie "The State" for MTV, and for themselves - that is, for themselves - before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rud went to larger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-like era permanent memories.
But as a franchise it feels like it's a little time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it was a original story for a speaking dosing vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stimulating on the core of the gag - actress of medium-aged children who are going to grow - they still managed to recover the last part of the joke.
"Ten years later," with adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the finest possible principle, including a riff on the Stalker films in the 90s, such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Screws the Cradle").
On one point, a character stood through an Apple Powerbook, some Inline boxes and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The dear coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, has not yet forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-böslike plot in which Ronald Reagan (also as Mr. Showalter), is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.
It makes especially fun to see theever young Mr. Rud, the Matt Dillons Unterlippenbart of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knacker.
The moments are random wahnshine that could heat this franchise like a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I am as his logical conclusion: "Wit Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how she will visit the film premieres of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" to Amazon now reminds of another type of nostalgy: the reconstruction of the Cold War of "The Americans" to the film "Atomic Blond" and even "GLOW" with its East-Turn-West Ring Campf Iconography.
The comödie created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, suggests to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two police as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hardly scattered Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (as well as a exporting producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt to English.
It's a generous idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look at (the police spend the time to look at chess in the TV, how Americans may do it with soccer).
And the list of the famous speaker - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides for a consistent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" engages in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda-Dramas - a killer wearing a Reagan maske will be involved - that it often plays as a single one.
At six long episodes it gets there, and the comody is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was realized at a lower length, could be better delivering his agitprop satellite, as Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devoured a hip of Hamburg.
The message for the imaginated Communist audience is that the Western culture can make everything to feed for a situation.
The fictional Romanian Creator was not wrong: We even make it with our younger history and with their own.
Schlag against drugs mobs in the country
The police had succeeded in the battle against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Blackwald-Baar-Kreis, in Redtweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the State Prosecutorship announced on Friday.
15 accusers were arrested between 25 and 77 years of age and already arrested against them.
In addition, officials ensured larger quantities of Marihuana and cokain, shoes and several hundred thousand euros.
In Italy, two persons were arrested in time.
Against the two suspicious Italians, there were German liability commands.
The two are probably delivered to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian mediators.
Over 300 policemen were totally in use.
Members of the Mafia are expelled to prevent organised drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder, as well as robbery and depression.
Since summer 2016, the state prosecution has been determined by Constanz against organized drug trade in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, the Kripo Rottweils had nearly daily contact with her colleagues in Sicily.
The large revenue was therefore accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
In the investigator of the investigations, Italian nationals were particularly referring to the Italian Mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several ships were fired in a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the account of the bands.
How complains large holes in the Foreign Registry
"Data of citizens that should not appear": a report indicates significant lacks in Germany by the foreign registry.
This leads to participating misleading decisions in asylum procedures.
The mission for the refugee management of the Federal Government, Frank-Yürgen Way, has made a media report attention to large holes in the foreign central register.
The lack of data registered there could result in asylum procedures and discriminations "to partially digging failure decisions", warned way in an analysis of the South German newspaper.
According to the register, ten million people have foreign nationality, including approximately 5.7 million from non-EU States.
The data will therefore be managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data were not maintained sufficiently, the data quality in parts would not have been well.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "from people who are long-lasting, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register".
"incorrect data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues.
The statistics on outgoing people have been recorded above that EU citizens who do not have to travel out.
Such false assignments, however, led "to a distorted debate on the handling of accrued persons," says it accordingly in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government apparently began sending refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they are traveled from there.
This results from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
In the paper, according to that, the BAMF has resumed such procedures "between families with children - with the exception of nurses and youngsters - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible, so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site.
Following the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU State which they first reach is responsible.
If a migrant continues to another EU country, this State can send it back to the land of entry.
For the reasoning, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacities for families with children under age have significantly increased in Italy".
Italy has issued guarantees for the recording and accommodation of families.
Even the European Justice for Human Rights (ECMR) believes that these commitments are sufficient.
Other EU States would also send refugees back there in the context of the Dublin Agreement.
The innspolitical speaker of the Left Fraction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "families with children threaten because of the lack of human rights in the Italian asylum system and a danger of childhood".
Second best results achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Oberreichbach was already available for other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All before Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his donations.
Traditionally, the municipal meeting of the municipal council values the multiple willingness to spend blood.
"It is generous as our body is designed for it and we respect the donors who make their blood available for foreigners, still unusual", underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood losses helps several people," explained the circular preparation leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conservation is put into its components.
This could even benefit three people from a bloody person.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in Oberreichbach in the spring.
"In this year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the Dr.K. crisis manager.
Apparently, the change to the theatre house has led to higher number of participants.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multi-speakers and were awarded for 50 people who were conducted.
Half so many books Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Your Vetter spend ten times per 500 milliliter from their life supply.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rate at 0,25 %
The Bank of England will likely later announce that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the deterioration of the inflation have forced speculations over an increase.
The Bank of England warned that the economic growth will remain "trading" when it maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthening pressure.
The Bank's political decision-makers (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.25%, with less members in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase in the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure would continue to the budget income, with inflation expected to rise to at least 3% in autumn.
However, it signaled that in the following years interest increases would be necessary to raise the inflation heated by the broad and said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.
Members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mammut conjuncture package which was released before one year after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the next February, although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide more 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Sterling.
Minutes after the decision on interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC the gross domestic product (BIP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on the real income of the households continues to be burdened."
To the interest rates, it repeated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be needed to cool the inflation and a "ietch greater" size than the markets are expected.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "steadily" and "limited".
The Bank's growth forecasts downwards for this and next year are compared with the 1.9% prognosted in May and 1.7%.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news compared to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollar and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth rates have decreased the increasing expectations on an increase in interest and the GDP has increased to 0.2% in the previous three months in the second quarter.
In the third quarter, growth is expected to be 0.3%, although it will easily be recovered after the bank by the end of the year.
The latest inflation report has been little enthusiasm for households which are affected by increasing inflation and low increases in sales, as the deterioration first becomes even worse before it becomes better.
She added that the monetary policy cannot "hinder the incomitation" in the next years, but she added that the wages will be recovered by the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU agreement caused by the sincing of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will achieve the prices and the economy.
Before the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates, the call has risen after an increase in interest rates, as the inflation increased the pressure on poor households, with three political decision-makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5%.
The inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% over the last month, although the bank said that this was expected and that it will be releasing in the coming months.
The bank said that the overrun in relation to its goal of 2% should be "good" to be attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Due to the recent decline of the Swap Councils, the mortgage market should become more competitive, as the creditors are looking for businesses and want to end the year positively.
The market looks particularly good for those with which the existing dealers are running and closing the new mortgages, and many with free of charges and low rates are becoming more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to describe controversial HIV drug 100,000 people
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a preexposition prophylaxe (PrEP), which can reduce the infective risk of high-risk patients by around 86 percent, now supplied by the health service over a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He made himself ready to finance the process after the appeal court had confirmed a judgment by the Supreme Court last year, which the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The shipzug announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens as a "standing new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this as "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be one of the first ones that will allow the application of people, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposition prophylaxe (PrEP) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP reduces HIV transmission in infection hazardously.
To take PrEP before gender traffic means that there are just enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
Those in question include swilled or bisexual men, transsexual and HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified that agree to the study, including males, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner, whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered at a home doctor can also log in for possible participation in their locally participating sexual clinic.
The programme will sign an agreement on the supply of medicinal products this week after an international competitive purchase.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, as is used in large scales.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and recover the far-reaching and increasing successive efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in tackling one of the greatest health challenges of mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Truth), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if focused on needy and hazardous people, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV-Risiko will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner that results in improving many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left.
Now, as the PrEP test medicine was provided, we are on the best way to protect more than 100,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, a shadow minister of Health, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overlap after months of delay and desperate implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transfer of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected and to contribute to the ending of HIV distribution in society.'
Living the great life: Between floors and clever designer tricks have changed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, was reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a evidence of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold its pockets.
"To this time I lived with my ex in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was similar to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I loved them and made me an offer this day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of large apartment has been completely overridden.
Originally a one-room estate with an inbedden layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauraum and a interior floor to optimize the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, much light.
That was my request," she says.
To this end, she appointed the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces above each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a intermediate floor in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steel work is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were pillowed over each other without we had to bow.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but creating the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two spaces in full height over each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the interior floor, a classic copper light window of Retrouvus looks down the glamourous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let him work longer.
In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window in another room.
On the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all bestecks and glasses of Joanne.
By observing a more glamourous room, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapseable kitchens are nothing new.
This is particularly the case that it is a garbage agency.
"A little engineering art went there," explains Erfan from the Steel strengthened, furnished MDF-Tür.
"It's counter-weight, so that when you move the door, it's very easy to loop."
Thanks to the clever use of room and room, Joanne could gain additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and a improved layout.
"On the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form a real estate maker will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."
Here they have managed to increase the ground surface and at the same time use high quality materials that provide its luxurious advantage to the room.
"The materials are the things you touch and are therefore helping to create a emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't leave yourself into the electric steckdoses in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can be transformed by good design and increased number of square meters from something standardly into something very surprising.
In fact, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estateimperium
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a conflict because of one of the largest real estates Victoria's value of over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton-Football-Club' and De Lutis developer, Colin De Lutis, lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. This brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business should be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict on the separation will take place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have 38 real estates in value of more than half a billion dollars, gathered since the family had bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.
The Westco Jeans family founded in a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the centre.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul described as "Haupt Operator and the dominant personality" in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company’s capacity and Paul about one third.
A court act claims that this means that Colin has property in the value of 316 million dollars and Paul at the value of 176 million dollars.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidvit.
Last Friday, after several failures, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now fighting the control of the existing business - which, as Paul claims, made him out of it.
Colin argues that this wasn't true, but Paul prefers to manage some possessions incompetent.
In an early Affidvit, submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to convey the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidvits, e-mails and reports of companies, including Deloittes, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicates businesses from late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.
They used the safety to buy the Collingwood love, in which Colin opened the first jeansladen of the family.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my past years of high school when Paul was still a child (unless 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that they and Luigi who died in 2012 hoped to pass their property to their sons well.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis company group, with Colin claims that Mark had been paid 10 million dollars and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says "the conditions of their financial separation were bitter."
Colin retained very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can't really say much," because the case was before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to complain me and pull our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's claims.
"Our father wouldn't like Paul and I would end in our current struggle," he said and added that he "forever hoped for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our issue will be solved by the courts in the near future," said Colin.
Trump's new Chief of Stab plans to limit the President's media diversity.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If yes, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the head at a more equal course.
Here's a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of the White House, came together with directors on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to fix: bad information that was in the hands of the President.
Kelly said to the employees that information about him should flow, whether in paper or in letters, because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information."
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to taste Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship to television is enough for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was indignated because of an unclear reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places to convince," said the former election campaigner Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control is, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that its personal media consumption includes an increased praise.”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is surprising.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don't know to others - that Trump's Tweets had included even more ignitional substance without their interventions.
We'll probably never learn about the Tweets who didn't send Trump.
If his employees had been able to keep him away from his trouble, then their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one could be able to prevent Trump's controversy.
One part of the problem is that people in a white house that is composed of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views from the world.
Politico - all of this story - reported in May on the preferred consultants to give the President doubtful information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Actual and former Trump officials say that Trump like a volcano can respond to negative press cuts, especially those with harmful leakages, and that he understands where they come from.
The same thing happened at the end of February, when a person was malicious to the president of a printed copy of GotNews.com, the Internet Provocateur’s website Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Stabschefin Katie Walsh to be "the source behind being a hop of lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for shanes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he expressed false prerequisites in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh."
Goldmakers added that Rob Porter, then Stab's head of Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the Paper Kram, get the Trump".
How did this fall?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving to influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most desirable crimes receive post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the population's assistance will be prayed and hoped.
In this summer (virtual) the police are sending cards to dangerous criminals on the flight.
Since the addresses of the seeked heavy criminals are not known naturally, indications from the population will be hoped and prayed.
Europol reported on Friday of the action followed by the winter "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar.
Experiences would have shown that many refugees were hidden in holiday destinations, called Europol.
21 Postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016 there is a website of www.eumostwaned, more than 2.5 million times it was considered.
36 of the online requests could be arrested, at least eleven of it due to the indications following the publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate over a tomb and return to 'Millionary-series'
Some of the most prosperous house owners of the West Midlands are again standing with some decisive travelers on war foots, who have negotiated one of the municipal graves to demand a field back in front of their lords.
The travelers have parked their 20 cars on a field outside a well-being street of Solihull, called the "Millionary-series".
They have brought horses, babies and a army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being scared by the Council, to prevent their attacks.
The tactful group found a lique in the defense plants and pressed her vehicles by a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Wondering residents have insulted Solihull's council, who said it was "nutzable to address the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They were moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passengers.
The Council must be forced by harm to implement, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived yesterday night, probably more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council cannot stop it once."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's scarce, we have just seen the last round of these travelers, just to be plundered by another round.
The figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area."
A speaker of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of and work with Solihull's police. We take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible.
In order to support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents can report an anti-social or criminal behavior with the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
Out of Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise will be.
The house before the gates of joyful cities is currently renovated and will be opened again on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
As a result of the conclusion of the Hotel Birkenhof through the former Ambiente Company mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnights per year were lost and also revenues through the Kurtaxe.
In the autumn 2014, due to dramatically increasing number of refugees in the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the establishment of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to ensure the area as a hotel location.
At that time, the decision was not uncontradicted in the Council of the Community.
But most of all, joyful town's upper bourgeois Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interested in the house at that time.
He should keep right.
The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Schererer, seating in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary enforcement in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star-class category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joy city object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, Bauschuttcontainer has been standing before the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, the extensive renovation work will be made.
The floors were cracked out, decked partly, old bathing weapons were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There's much to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Schererer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large favourable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built.
Everything later was supposed to be "shine bourgeois" as Thomas Schererer pressed.
"We want to make a jewelry tight."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities.
You don't want to position on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated interior niveau, emphasizes Schererer.
The Forest hotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to set itself wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidays, groups or businesses should feel well at the hotel.
He has already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, says Scherer.
The ideas of the city were decking with those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
After the amount of investments asked, Thomas Schererer does not want to set precisely.
At least one million euros, he counts.
The outdoor plants are also brought to front man, that's already visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace will be accessible from the restaurant that is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia-Affäre: U.S. specialists set up Grand Jury
According to a report, a so-called Grand Jury in the Russian affair of US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller is supposed to have used a so-called Grand Jury.
The body has taken up the work over the last few weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote on the subject of occupation with the subject of trusted personnel.
The newspaper rated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified its investigations.
The CNN sender reported that there are already first preloads of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump’s oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US Secret Services have long been accusing the Kreml to have concentrated in the presidency campaign in 2016.
Mueller examines whether there were talks between Trump's election campaign team and Moscow.
The research focuses on several men who acted in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump's private and business environment under the lupe.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special median Trump had personally moved into the centre and examined whether the President may have disabled justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to raise accusation.
Grand jurys are therefore also called accused chambers.
They are mostly activated when there are major and controversial cases.
The procedure always occurs behind closed doors.
The body can also be activated by the prosecution of the State to preload persons for use under oath.
According to the CNN sender, preloads have already been distributed about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to make a statement, said in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner were also at the conversation as well as his preliminary Chief Paul Manafort.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. TV that the introduction showed that Mueller would not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily be called that the Grand Jury will be activated at the end to decide on the survey of a complaint.
However, the establishment of the body of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern of President Trump.
In the midst of the new enthusiasms, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total invention," said Trump.
The topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to "be good to feel because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he wouldn't know anything about the introduction of a Grand Jury.
However, this work was usually in secret, he stressed.
The White House supports any measures that accelerated the work of the special mediator in "fair".
The former FBI-Chef James Comey said three times that the Presidents are not determined.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed it was continued in the statement.
But Mueller was used only after Trump camey had fired.
Because of this juice, suspect against Trump had become upset, he wanted to impede the justice.
Comey said in June before a Senats Committee, Trump asked him for a setting of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President stands under pressure for the investigation.
After displaying US media, the White House collected material against the special mediator and his employees.
The speculations have been disposed of whether Trump Mueller wants to release.
Unlike an independent special mediator of the convention, such as in the Watergate affair around the later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be fired theoretically on the thirds of the President of the Ministry of Justice.
Senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented laws which could no longer be dismissed on Thursday.
Antarctica: Gigantian Eisberg drives in Antarctica
In Westantarktis, a Giantian iceberg has been dissolved from the shelf-seven size of Berlin.
On Wednesday, the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research shared it.
Over one billion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers of large coloss now drive to the north and will probably need two, three years until he was molten.
It is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice ignorants who have registered researchers in the past three decades.
A danger for people is not going from him.
As far as climate change has played a role in the cancellation of the ice mountain, research is unclear.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.
Many researchers believed that this could be linked to warming.
The now broken coloss was part of the Larsen-C shelf.
Sheal festival swims on the sea and is spoiled by large glaciers.
It therefore grows continuously into the sea and regularly breaks off.
Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America nearly at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Northern this shelter was the balance of waxes and canceling some years ago.
A complete celebration was broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There are some things to say that the Larsen-C scale festival is in danger because the front edge has never drawn back as far as the present.
In addition, the ice plate stands under tension and may fall broken when a key place breaks a piece.
The melting of shelf and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as it sweats on the water, and ice sweats as much water as it is after the melt itself.
However, the loss of the shelf feast leads to the glaciers to mouth directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could increase sea level, but only in mode, the British research project writes to observe Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest shelves festival of Antarctica after AWI applications with almost 50 000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it turns off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change is aware, the ice mark now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
"This is the most widely withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, if the Larsen-C Schelvest will now grow or go back for a long period and perhaps collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "Our models say that it will be less stable."
But this development will last decades.
Even though these researchers do not bring down the breakdown of this gigantic ice mountain to climate change, many ice piles of the Antarctica Peninsula have been broken over the past decades.
This long Zipfel of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey Research Programme, the ice area of the Antarktis Peninsula has fallen by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The decrease in temperature increase contributed to the decline.
The Antarctica peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the last 50 years and counts to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.
CDU wants to house rate at personnel
As it becomes more and more difficult to occupy free jobs, the CDU calls for the employer's association to become more attractive.
Only just before the summer break, the circuit day has passed 41 new bodies in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circuit administration in Mettmann.
Now again 17 trainers have their first working day behind themselves.
The classes at the circle appear to be very delighted.
Some 620 applications were made for the places to be given this year.
Nevertheless, the circle lacks further personnel in order to manage the increased requirements and tasks.
There are currently not occupied jobs in the Mettmann circle.
In addition, doctors and engineers and powers of general administration are required.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative on the circuit day, together with the FDP and the UWG, and against the lack of professional power in the administration.
The administration is intended to "elaborate a concept of personal recruitment and personal development according to the desire of the parties".
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for professionals but to counteract the application's shortage, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented into and outside, specific measures for cross-border entrepreneurs and include a training open, demands CDU, FDP and UWG.
That's after a good approach.
Because the circle has to do it with personal problems that you didn't know earlier.
Other cities are throwing good officials and employees and offering more attractive conditions.
It is spoken of a regular "competitive of public employers".
In this way a high number of employees who separate disease or age from the service.
So maximum time for action, so that no more jobs are left unset.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Group Chief of the CDU, is still beyond the joint application with its party.
He had long been providing a fascinating surprise during the circuit day when he asked the staff cost coverage publicly and the other parties refrained.
People want to be verified of all the possibilities that allow an exit from the local employee association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the circuit administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - should seek a petition," says Peoples.
Thus, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than the public service regulation is actually available.
The holders are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you are switching to a higher level that is directed to professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown in the past years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces have to be established in which employees care for the provisions of the new Prostituted Protection Act.
Not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: You have too little staff.
Italy strengthens the sound to NGO migrant ships
Italy has warned NGOs, which use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, that they should not continue this if they do not hold new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how to continue working," said Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis warned one day after the Italian authorities had taken a boat of the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had effectively worked with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation since one year, refused to express himself to a detailed prevention of the Italian state lawyer Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and the salvation of human life remains our top priority, so it's very sorry that we can't operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in a opinion on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently raised after we have collected all information and assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is assumed that his crew of smoking boat migrants take on board that is delivered directly by human dealers, and that the smugglers can be driven so that the ships can be reused.
At least such a meeting was expected to take place only 1,3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the act of the prosecutor whose contents were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to move away from the authority of the Italian coastal guard, from humanitarian reasons in the zone and not from any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have a Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have yet been ready to keep the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable because they would not bring "real changes or disabilities" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign it is the Nobel Prize Trainer Organization doctors without limits (MSF).
In the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had declined significantly over the last few weeks, pointing out that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal wake and cooperation with local burgemeesters have carried fruit.
"In the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Tschad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope to reach Europe.
Increases and Trials
Neun Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin's outdoor posts" and two guest drivers met in Guardenheim in the northern plant to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for that.
The accommodation in the Guardenheim Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was an welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which we could look far beyond the Pfälzer Forest and the front-speaked levels.
In the meantime, there were still longer increases for which long trials rewarded.
The second day it went to the Saline and the Volksfest Würstmarkt to Bad Dürkheim.
The viewpoint renewed, connected with "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many meters have been reported again.
Cottages, rocks, doors, castles, ruins and incoming houses brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers are breathing sole in the free air inhalatorium.
New City was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 meters, the group had learned the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sports and cultural.
Konsole instead of Rasen - Bundesliga stands for e-sport
Do the sports stars sit in the future before computer consolation instead of fighting through the stadium races at wind and weather?
Fact is: E-Sport has long become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, million fans and huge tournaments with high gaps.
This also recognized the first Bundesliga associations, which are more and more active in this area.
At the beginning of 2015 VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, founded an e-sport department in the middle of July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope to be enthusiast with this very new young target groups for the VfB," says Board of Director Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that there are still many associations on this train".
In the coming weekend, the FIFA Football World Association organises the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London with which the players of various clubs tackle each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified themselves.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-sport.
The Ex-Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen advises a Agency for Virtual Soccer Players.
"The real football must focus on the 14-30-year-old that young people are still going into the stadium in the future," says 52-year-old.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, you could be far more present on these markets than sending the Bundesligaship to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In the e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2, "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are fighted at competition level.
During the longest time, as in normal sports, lights have established, in which professionals tackle each other.
And with the Asian games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a right sport?
For many, the idea is safely necessary.
Ingo Froböse also has long been confronted with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports High School in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - e.g. increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive capabilities, a technical and tactic understanding and a fast response ability.
Professional players should train not only on the console but also their body and respect the diet.
"The right player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping becomes more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
Positively, the scientist has the high integrative effect of the e-sport.
The players are internationally traveling, that's like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of company advice Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) requires a racial growth in the e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years, sales are estimated to be 130 million.
Against the almost 2,4 billion euros of the football bondsliga, this is little.
However, the e-sport "is no longer far away from the other established sports like Handball, Basketball or Eishockey", writes the Deloitte consultants.
International is already a lot of countries.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-Basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the U.S. team NRG eSports.
Hollywood-Sauer Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport weather provider Unicrn.
In Europe too, there are some things to do.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a course, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the Soccer-Erstliga unit is now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In the European comparison Germany deteriorates behind," says VfB's Board of Romtgermann.
Only falling in Nostalgie, and explaining the old times, is no longer enough today.
It is about maintaining the tradition of the association, but the company at the same time set up on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world", says Dutt.
"There can't be held that just when soccer, everything remains as it was always."
Gift-Eier ade - The Ei-Alternatives for cooking and baking

Michelle Carter sentenced for the texts that Conrad Roy urged suicide,
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind grids and five years have been suspended on currency.
Carter was sentenced in June for driving killing Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is incredible.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free to call.
She was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representative claimed that both her and Mr Roy had left a psychic disease.
In red pants and a cream colored flower dressed, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with falling hands and downward eyes when she was condemned.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the lawyer said the court.
"She finished his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any repentance."
But Carters lawyer said that it was a "shameful state that she was totally regretted".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that her "old or mature degree or even her mental disease has a significant influence on their actions".
A lawyer read a statement by Roy's Mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is no day that I do not trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me, and like I go around with everything. I try, despite all my pain we will bear with us for eternity, to be there for his sisters," says it.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "tracked" by the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children.
"Don't have this only person, with which I had been together every day since my birth, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal precession case, since there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found to be dead from a carbon monoxide in a vehicle in 2014.
The case moved national attention to itself after Carters revealed text releases that they had encouraged him to finish his life.
"Have up, jump from a building, first yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent her in the two weeks before his death while he was in vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You must do Conrad" and "All that you need to do is turn into the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to Mordes to her British resident in Italy in 2007 before she was released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new mini lame of the FC Bayern
Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup, not a chance.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed-Cup winner a large season - extra motivation does not harm.
Something else was on his place in the cabine, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even if the additional piece of clothing was very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no manuel New were seen, he made the boundary that was assigned to him stop the arm.
"The trainer did not announce it," said Confed-Cup winner after his first use as Bayern captain.
Well, the record could have run better than 0:2 against the SSC Neapels.
But the sign of the coach could show Kimich that way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf who had been selected from youth players, debutants and just from holidays.
Sugarl is most popular to those who want to keep at Laune.
So those who were exposed to enter the heritage of lahm can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday the 22-year-old as a mini-lahm fled over the field.
Right behind, that's his position now, the white bin on the arm did her remaining.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this initial formation like the one who can take the row the best in hand.
He gave instructions, tried to borrow the inexperienced Truppe.
He had the whole look, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal in order to surpass his missing fitness (flips hard); Renato Sanches in order to join the powers of Asia-Race (follow only pretend); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle in order to avoid negatively falling into their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot.
This was very good at all.

The namely occupied Napoli Sturm was often difficult and also tried to succeed in playing a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped it".
But he also showed a good performance in debut.
Movement of the game, temporarily: "I was taken for this style too".
As unusual this Bavarian world is still for new access, it was seen after the party.
Rudy, for example, gave not one or two in the catacombs but determines six or seven interviews.
Kimich adopted a few funny statements in the back of his new competitors.
There he heard of silver a interesting sentence: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game".
He doesn't need to learn the new one anymore.

Company satisfied with Rheinland-Pfälzic Minister: Economy praises Wissings temporarily
It was often uncertain, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still economic minister of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This shows more than one year, in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs of People's Wissing (FDP) is officed.
Rooms and businesses from the region speak on T V request of change in economic policy, and at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Trierer Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked all over it".
The largest turnover sees Natus in infrastructure policy: The hole of the car 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now very high in the priority list of the country.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure, until 2021 is supposed to be construction law.
A role in the country's plans also plays the western surroundment of Trier, which is in the foremost need of the federal road route plan.
The aim is to take the route in December 2020, says Ministerial speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a way to support regional, but international competitive companies.
The industrial and commercial chamber (IHK) Trier is aiming, as stimulated by Wissing, a Rheinland-Pfalz label in order to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine export that has been decaying for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish a company, praises IHK.
The Trier Handwerkskammer sees an additional stimulation for young trainers in the new Master Bonus, says director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 for the file master test and EUR 2500 when graduates make themselves independent within ten years after master training.
The home job list for the country remains long.
With the planned road construction, there are rapid facts, at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, head of the IHK Trier.
From 56 new engineers who want to set Wissing in the country business are currently only 29 jobs occupied.
IHK calls for more contracts to external offices.
CDU Grouping Vize Christian Baldop refers to calculations from the Court of Auditors, investing the country 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the conservation of national roads than proposed.
In addition, Frank Natus expects another concept of the country, as it wants to address the lack of professional forces in the region.
In addition, the broadband expansion in the country is a reluctant.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed network supply in an IHK survey only with the note 3.4.
You are complaint about stocking Internet connections and abbreviations.
However, Ex-Business Minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still located in the Board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke for April to become President of a private universities in Karlsruhe, where she had already cleared the field after four months because of unanimities.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counterreaction
One day before Audi announcement said BMW that it would offer the software to update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company would be the opinion that "the more intelligent options are given as driving restrictions" and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the company as a revocation.
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emitte diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for automotive manufacturers to install plants for neutralisation of the exhausted exhaust gases from diesel vehicles are also increased, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused to impair the powerful car companies and to ignore signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could use the use of so-called abbreviated devices that were able to regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of Volkswagen, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be courted in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations with Volkswagens, after the authorities accused that Audi had installed a system to deal with emissions in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi into the investigation could be difficult for folk cars: The luxury automobile manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen.

Mordillo's Knollennasen and laughing against the suffering
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most commonly published cartoon signs, the kneelings of his figures are its marks.
Also with 85, the Argentinian still marks and works on a movie.
His message: Laugh, "and there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he went through as a painter for congratulations - what frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, it came to pass the end of the 60s of the breakthrough: the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artists of cities are always inspirational.
Gross, round murderillo figures tample in drawings with Pisa's fat tower, Big Ben in London and the Red Place in Moscow.
In the early morning, he is still at the significance of its own details, almost ten hours work daily.
About calendars, puzzles, books for greys and small, T-Shirts, plumbers and watches, his stunning figures continue to be widespread worldwide.
He has been working on a painting film and a TV series with his figures for six years.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a Girafe - Mordillo's most popular animal in its drawings - which has a dozen fiber as a counterpart.
First, his figures in the 3D film, which will come to the cinema's wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
Therefore, he puts rather on the TV series, which, as its original marks, is produced without a word.
threatened lavendel from provence of climate change
He has become a symbol of provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavendel is deferred because of the conditions of drought and insects distributed from diseases, which scientists and farmers seeking to find solutions prepares great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in the Provence, said: "The lavendel in provence is effectively threatened because the plant has exposed the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn.
This has impact on the life span of Lavendel.
There is also a small cycade, a microbacterium that transmits twins, and with very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot on the game.
Lavendel oil is not only locking for holidays, it is also very demanded for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with aesthetic oil."
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowing of soil dilution, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thüring Rhine has celebrated its 1200-year-old existence.

The murder of an journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the Riodoce weekly newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays in order to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and unrepentant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office that was the target of an attack with granates in 2009 or leave them home.
Security experts wrote three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, Neutrale, Verbunnente.
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businesses, journalists who are suspected to stand on the government's balance list or cardials, a catalogue of criminals making the Chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no retirement of violence, and while in the whole country the bodies are hiding, there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered its office in December 2012. 589, after attacks and threats under federal protection, there have been at least seven dead this year in seven states.
Among the latter, her publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, the composer Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is living in Mexico and being journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs.
His lack will be deeply funded, although its presence is everywhere - a great picture of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reports in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-Shirts, which show his luxury face with brille or its typical Panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reports discuss their divided topics, the dreama, their Alpine rooms, sleeplessness, Paranoia.
Although a special German lawyer was built in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two penalties in accordance with the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with most thousands of murders connected each year with drug trade and organized crimes, the killers of journalists will only rarely be judged.
With Riodoce, they are still inclined to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are improper and although the Terrain is still more betrayable.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all miss."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "swölfter River".
The shield went away into his car and damaged it closely.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Gerüchts tend to flee freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is virtually nothing like silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields of the country, since rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, someone or more people will be shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of distorted, two-stricky musoles for drug kings who are greater than many houses for the living.
For a minute, forget that there is a state of "rest", if only one cardll has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was disrupted with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have been angry with the sons, expected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skioske.
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country to his own security after the assumption of another newspaper that had published the same history.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined five colleagues to form Riodoce and sold 50 dollars.
In Sinaloa, "was impossible to operate journalism without struggling on the Rauschgift problem," Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper deserved a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and increased sales and advertising.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hardly striking studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else was waiting to treat.
Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Preis" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever she was conducted.
He admitted volunteer that he was afraid.
"I want to survive," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drugshandel in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You need to take the task you like as a journalist - either that or you play the dumbs.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in view of so many dead ... why didn't you say what was happening?"
The Riodoce team misss Valdez, the fun bird that could fluke like a port worker, the friend who was generously with embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar from the office, and always sit there on the same table.
Now she asks, Was his love for the routine his corruption?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and remain alive.
"You don't like to deal with her women, her children, her clean shops, her homely start-up and landing cars," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-determination and self-holding.
Trust his own instincts.
If it's wrong, stay away from it.
The anger is, said the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, "A sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applied in Sinaloa - as is not the same as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where toxic mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the area where Riodoce’s employees met for security training were suddenly no phones allowed. Days earlier, it was known that spyware, which is sold exclusively by governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
There were two police protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 °C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were assigned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-stage building in a central class quadruple of Culiacan.
Half in the war, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police who called the governor itself as not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reports have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug bands are the facto.
For the edition of this week, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on state expenditure that focused on the home city of the governor.
And there was a group that was released in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the state lawyer.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or done, so it was careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, belonging to the governing institutional revolution Party (PRI), which almost ruled all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused for high-care cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military accident.
Only a few months earlier, the readers considered the Columne of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping.
"For example, we would have known what has happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body scene.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office was devoted to the storage room for characters and stickers who protest against the murders of journalists because the employees became something that they never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez got a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the state lawyer.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
All over the country, journalists have become more loud by writing in organized tests "SOS Press" on walkways and constructions.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for the justice in the case of Valdez.
In a meeting with the Sinaloa governor on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to pioneer journalists and let them kill because they said the truth.
She has then asked for her reunification by the government because she worried that her anger has injured its objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crimes, government officials and an indecisive society.
In his last book of "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug bands but also commanded by politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with organized crime.
The "Articulo 19" media guard group has associated more than half of the attacks to police journalists and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.
The murders seem to have a terrible effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas card: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the unusual Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana did from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cards with a guide item on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in the exile, and they still watch the streets and seek for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it appears to be murdered to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who remain back and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, admits that the drug deal is afraid of him.
"Mexiko goes to hell, and therefore I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat at the civic stage in front of the office and drinking beer when all their phones began to swim.
A series of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the town of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war further escalated as it was promised by a series of Cardll bombs in the region.
From the edge of the board, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed on the next day.
Sirenen healed close to another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the police who kept the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible throughout Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his traces.
"How can you just think about it?" said Bojorquez, "if the same day on which Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send it to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurus used tarnation to deviate his enemies
At the first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrible.
Now researchers have discovered that the first knowledge of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian minor workers has been so well received that experts described it as "Monna Lisa of Dinosauriers".
It was so well received that they could even find that his shuffy skin was of Roman bride - and they said they had something of a "unruth past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-contained Dinosaurus, which was ever found, and one of the world's best dinosaurs".
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosauriers living between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible well-received state has survived researchers who described it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the plant fertilizer is the best preserved fossil of his kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed to be missing on the spot from the surrounding rock and decided to see more precisely.
The Fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you are just blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has been sleeping," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to see.
"It will enter into the history as one of the most beautiful and most conserved dinosaurus examples - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosauriers."
Researchers have found that these plant fertilizers, although covered with a weapon and similar to a walking tank, were probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs.
The strongly pancerated dinosaurs used a red and white tarn to hide from robbery, and used a screening technology known as counterfacing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and deviate his enemies, tell experts what suggests that it was threatened by larger dynosaurs.
The 110 million years old creativity from the Nodosaurier family has first made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to carefully detect it.
Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists enabled the surprising conservation of the copy to document the pattern and form of shoes and weapons about his body.
They discovered the contradiction, a widespread defense method in the animal empire, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their bottom side.
Although the counter discharge is usual, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is largely exceeding the size of today's living animals.
It suggests that the dinosaurer was hungry of sufficient pressure by meat-fresh dinosaurers that evolution benefited the confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter discharge - think of Rehe, Zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more harmful than prudent, which signals that this nodosaurian was suspended to survive.
"Stark Raubtier's behavior on a massive, strongly panced dinosaurs show how dangerous the Dinosauriers must have been in creative time," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of Dinosaurus was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life, including its preserved contents, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that when he died, the dinosaur was driven into a river and driven out to the sea, where he ran on the back to the sea ground.
At this time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inward than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved supper skin, but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early creative time.
You don't need much fantasie to use to reconstruct it. If you shiel a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he's sleeping."
The creative time was a time when huge theropods, meat fertilizers, who stood on two legs, went through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived million years to Borealopelta, the pantered dinosaurer was hunted by some of his fearful ancestors.
This includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six tonnes of heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was set up in the sea after death and mummed in the slaughter.
The creation was found by Shawn Funk, when he went to the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaurs in the world, including skin and army, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were an average of about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It had two 20-inch-long tips raged by his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the plant fertilizer was swimed by Western Canada until a flooded river flowed it into the open sea.
But the subwater deposit of the Dinosaurier kept his weapon in exquisitem detail.
The stoned remains of this special copy are so well received that the skin rests still cover hole tank plates along the dinosaurus
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of maintenance is the same as a profit in Lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it will.
Stricked rest of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that wear the damage of the animal.
His right foot lies on his side, his five fingers are spread up.
I can count the shoes at his sole'.
In the wound: Mass Carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heated accident on Thursday evening on A8: Knapp 30 vehicles are developed into a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injuries, kilometers of stairs and gaffers.
During the late Thursday afternoon, Stuttgart-München (A8) has been injured at a mass caramboe situation of about 20 people.
According to first information, the police were between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) at 17.00 p.m., during a caster, nearly 30 vehicles, including trucks, were intermediate.
The exact number of injured ones did not present any information at first.
It's about light to medium-sized injuries, said a police speaker.
A great ban on rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was fully locked towards Munich.
In Munich, a 10-mile-long retreat formed itself.
As an AZ reporter reports, there was also an enormous disabilities on the tramway - through numerous gaffers.
The fire war was noted by the marks of the vehicle lenders, which are now expected to have sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dating.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue brass was on the road to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing you have been sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you're deepened in his work and just have a generous thought.
And then, pufff.
Come on to the sheepfriend and wake up an inappropriate or take the passenger out of the workflow.
Flying card control.
But the times of interruption are soon over.
The German railway is currently testing the creator-free car control.
You just confirm by phone that you take your place and thus deny the bicycle card.
At present a test operation runs on two routes.
"Come on the offer, we'll get it out.
At the beginning of the next year, it will then be expected to be available on many further distance routes in Germany," said one train pilot.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the railway the card devaluation without sheepfresh.
To use it, however, some conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you need to have booked an online ticket - what's already the most passengers doing.
You also need to buy it via the train app, the DB Navigator, which is the most comfortable type of ticket booking.
And you have a seat reservation last needed.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works so: one rises into the train, calls up his ticket under "My tickets".
The test customers then appear a button for electronic devaluation.
The train bend managers will receive a message on their mobile devices that driving gas X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
Comes the train gate manager at the travel card control at place Y he knows that there is a passenger with already disassessed online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, continue to swear.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which should use the passengers again.
"Who wants to relax without a ticket control by our train person travel, checks in the DB Navigator simply yourself.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personally on the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB remote transport.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs".
Those who often drive railways know that next to delays and missed trains, the road card controls belong to the greatest troubles.
For often you have yourself, but in any case one of the travelers does not have any documents that you need to evaluate online tickets.
Of course, the credit card or the personnel certificate or otherwise a document you need to present.
The consequences are endless discussions between train holders and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the district or large space and delays in controlling their own ticket and at the end take the finger take the time to care for other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that also is about the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-esees.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot to her core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she hired and rolled by Facebook on her phone.
She stolpled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old child and it is still on the street," said it there.
Confusions, since nobody had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly revoked at its timeline.
The rapper from the region of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old man who was killed by a white police officer in Fergusson, Mo...
He posted a picture of Brown's leblos body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She left her phone to return to Tweets to the Canfield Drive later on the evening.
There were photos from the police band and people who cried, and by a man who claimed to be Brown’s father who had a sign with the record: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed in which a police officer stood in front of a group of demons with a calling dog.
In another video, she said, she assured another police officer and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder that we have used and which we can typically call."
At this moment, I felt shockfrost.
I was angry and weeping."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 a.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinema from the 11th century.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the view of people living in the Community and filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Fergusson with her daughter who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two talked about a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "the black experience and the black condition".
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her,' said Ferrell later.
"That what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be drawn up in it.
It must be well developed, not only to activism and organisation, but also to know the different levels of black experience and the black constitution and to what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I am lucky to give her an experience where she personally does not experience an explosive racism, she is not different from the next black boy.
I feel that I would prove her a bad service to keep her away."
The first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority who became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-profit claims by Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped them to pass on to demonstrations.
Slowly, a new type of activism for Ferrell shape began to be adopted.
"My activity has changed totally after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all coming."
Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration of Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-regisseurs of the film.
Folayan said she and her camera man Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document what happened.
A question came about Ferrell: "Will you document or try to find a story that you can utilize?"
This creativity was generated by a number of people, often by whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and grown up in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already worked with Damon Davis's co-director, an artist from the area known for his activism for death contracts.
Ferrell brought the project closer, together with six other local people, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone speaking for us or talking to us. We're talking," Davis said.
"This was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, for I will be presented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience - to show that it was "not a Messiah leader but is a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participants in the film.
As a result, documents of "Whose Streets" show? Surprising personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, how she loves and marrys her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some injuriousness in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black swul women in the wider Black-Life-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, which have characterized the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media after the death of the black teenager Tray of Martin in 2012.
"But, sweat women in lead positions have worn the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting at various fronts.
Black, heavy women have to wear the main load of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is truly maintained by black women and many black women".
However, she suggests that "this is not a firm type of action," the Ferrell has been selected as the heart of the film because of its identity.
"She was the person who raised this energy," she said.
"It's not a random, although she was on the front front because in life, it's a black, sweaking woman so much on the game.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have gone long, but the racen links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on currency for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a car car in a demonstration.
She describes the societal atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A chaos".
Yet, she approves a song and she feels obliged to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"It's our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose – except our chains."
From "room" to "sizewahn": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been divided since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold doesn't leave the theme one.
The topic will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfriend Bitburg".
While one to the bit gallery says: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really class" (Nicole viewers), comes from the other side: "Don't be bored" (Siggi Betzen) or quite slight: "Sizewahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the advocates build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, which benefits from the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be exhausted.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farm market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the beginning of the construction work, it will be concluded.
The gallery machers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - to the Beda-Platz with the opportunity to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years.
Primarily our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always very happy again.
We've also discovered the Metzrei for us.
We would wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to get this offer upright.
In other cities there is also this.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Of direct marketers in a market hall in the gallery, the height of the rental is on.
But it may not be low at the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Where shopping pallets in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drought or supermarkets: I find this overflowing.
There's enough about that in our city.
You can see how many store shops are empty here - some since months and years.
However, since there is not even a fair week market here, it is very important that at least we will keep the market hall.
For, however, the product offered there is fresh, most of the products are offered directly by the producer and is priced above.
As you see, shop shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often unable for a retailer.
Shame, special businesses are almost no longer available and what is left about will still disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit to Bitburg.
Above all, where is the farm market hall going during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even on a long time, if the bit gallery is actually coming sometime.
Or does it already create the best bit gallery to distribute all businesses from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It'll just not work.
And a shopping center that is empty also needs no one.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, thanks to the incredible many - as I find - there is no more a place for unusual construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farm market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A suitable similarity: Artist creates Portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost unusual - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the cuts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analytics had destroyed a 35-year liability after it made a secretly classified diplomatic notifications on the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition that was opened on August 2, namely Acoming Resemblance (a suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was converted their expertise into technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a trans-frau and away-reaching dissident whose verurteilung of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, but also some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and created the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already openly spoke about the identification as a woman, was sentenced for 20 complaints, including six infringements against the spionage law, computer fraud and thief steel in 2013.
Due to the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a corny, black-white self-yourse, in which maning was clearly inevitably sitting on a driver seat and wearing a platinum-bleached pepper - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from Forensic Art Boxes such as cigarette drums and cheugummi by exhibiting DNA from waste to create a picture of how these people could look.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They led a interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her arrested museum were uneven letter friends who exchanged several letters over two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who predicted a future in which President Chelseas would turn judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama was actually just a few days after the book was published, Manning's release for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy gathering.
There is now something deep and powerful when opening the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads to a war against informers from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, dreadful ways to further disperse the starling divisions he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange Timing of all these things, she said that "this happens for a certain reason."
In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end of "Automatic splittering, whose basis were gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall its Mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in Bleistift.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hope is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, trackious memories, is also seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so it's 30 of these stories."
The last item in the exhibition that is stored in a separate room is a page from the Comic-Novele mentioned above.
She shows how she is living out of the United States disciplinary sailors like King-Cong with a voluntary phone.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it says.
"Then never stop the mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote me," said the artist who greets Philadelphia.
"I still get gänsehaut when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if she had to do it, then she will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, by her own genomic simulators, which, like horns of protesting.
This was also targeted as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, maning's stature") in which their genetic haplo groups were written with leadstift.
"In the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd of people," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwesten and a staff of the University of Oxford seeking to kill
A country-wide human hungd is at the Gange for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee from Oxford University, who is seeked as suspect after a man had been in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) prison orders were issued for murder due to their supposed participation in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death, as the acts of Cook County Office show.
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
One Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officers received an call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell Duranleau was still declared to death in the place of the event, and detectives examine the stings as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now consented and excluded from the campus of the Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities, and the Northwest University cooperates with this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
One speaker of the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in touch with the British police in contact and ready to help the US mediation authorities in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to lay down.
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he stressed the suspects to put up the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to localize it are strengthening," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a raadful tip that said that in apartment 1008 something was happening.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza Management Team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the time-out and the background of the victim and examines a variety of motifs, including a possible housing incident."
"We will conclude the WADA plan in the near future" - the Russian Vice-President Mutko
The Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said that it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World-Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a certain stage of fulfilment of the criteria of the driving plan, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA plan was updated in this respect," stated Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA riding plan to comply with the code described the criteria for reset RUSADA and recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to be worried.
"Everything has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list notes that the Russian anti-Doping authorities must accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to claimed state-profit dopings in Russian sports publicly.
As regards the matter, Mutko said: "We carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no governmental programmes, and we will not give up something that does not exist."
Mutkos words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-Doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one has proposed to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from the WADA by the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the postal doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the Chief Quarter of the Organisation in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA moved "in the right direction" to be re-established.
Aldi sold no more eggs at first
That's what the company groups shared.
It was a pure precaution that no health impairment could continue to be caused, said in the communication.
From now on, only eggs are expected to be delivered to Aldi, which were proven to have been tested negatively on fipronylant anti-leasures.
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with his customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Erret wanted to measure happiness at your e-Commerce startup with your employees, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - misleading.
And even if you promised anonymousity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Erret, who was the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of human resources start-ups is on the watch to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employees' company, it enables companies to carry out surveys to address special groups and demografic groups, to offer employees an anonymousity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, Whistleblowers allow the C-Suite leaders to deal with and turn directly to the Board of Directors.
"You now have tools like Strava and fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive by Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Errett said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint in the three years.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows the units most of the complaints and which leaders have low approval results, so that you can imitate why.
Companies come to see that at the top of the employment culture you have to stay in order not to be the next hour developed in Scandal since a former employer has published a blog post that describes a environment of complaints in which those who spoke have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business possibility.
Global governance, regulation and compliance banks may have more than $118.7 billion value in 2020 after the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, helping the company to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber Valley in Misscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently logged in as a client.
As Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "puls-" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS-Hotline, with which employees can report bad behavior.
And if the main manager is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has recorded the Regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and director of Convercent.
If a company is found that is badly treated or unethically maintained by his employees, it can experience costly consequences by consumer Boykott, worker generation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their business centre.
Earlier, if a employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the business centre, submit formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday General Counsel, who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees.
Well, since the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been identified and addressed by leaders who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, disadvantage or unpleasant practices.
"I can draw closer to this holistic 360 degree look in the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who guides the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take more seriously ethics, values and employees in 2002, after the bookkeeping foirma Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical infringements by the enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took place until the "social media came to their right" that companies recognized that you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry to go online.
"For the use of technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with return fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity to find the consent of Venture Capital Investors, who have supported both startup ups.
Convercent received $10 million in the financial year February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which increased the total capital to $ 47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Besemer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising in view of the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high holders and interesting projects are only revenues.
The employees want to feel that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices, and that the work you are worthy of being, then they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employye Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
investors reach Renditen when their portfolio companies are running well. Companies are running well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the analytics tools promise third parties to increase commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you find support.
The data on the employee participation is important according to the experts of the employment culture.
However, the data are unusual if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change is not quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointment and demotivate employees.
"If you are asking for 4.000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4.000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen the company who has left too much on the collection of data.
"When you don't follow, you will ask, "Do you really hear me?
Do you care about that?
And who do you don't care about why should I? "
Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to introduce measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, says Reason.
And after the collection of feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
With Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights on the employees, and hopes that in a long time, this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It is about 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players are held on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus.
Some have drawn out their tricotover parts and show the backs full of welding from the first day of the training suppressor.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are registered to summer courses will return to their final tests after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Football Center on the next morning at 6:30 pm.
"This is for the guys the next three days a real Tretmühle," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 p.m. in order to be justified to the already packed player's time schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day, where the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp nearly one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras, there were six playing times in Westwood practices.
They are supposed to stop during August 18 exercises. 20 prior to the start of the formal game preparations for their act against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the NCAA regulation even if they add a further point to the many affected routes of the players.
"We put this huge load three or four days on them, and it's very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just persecuted it, they just suck on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it's really great."
The UCLA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will have a clear viewpoint of its fields by an adjacent parking and the neighbouring Luskin Center, a hotel of the increased class that has already been administered with footballs, which will not be a light task behind a torpost.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far enough to think that people rent a room there and then set up to record an exercise.
If you have the video band from an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking space 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
I don't worry about this all too much.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact review in the fight against false messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false notifications to third parties’ fact checkers and show their results under the original contribution then, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight so-called Fake News.
The company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false notifications and to send them to facts auditors that may show results of the facts testing from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called Fake news, many believe that they also have influenced the US Presidency elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French electorates overflowed with false stories in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hatred postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement on German that in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be started.
"Only the knowledge of the stories of facts auditors of third parties, people want more context to make found decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the "in-connected article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Create a Comic Roman: A castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a slopfloch for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its cozy seat at Bewl River Tal in Kent and has become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a male Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says woely.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' surrounds the time from the Middle Ages to the Ages of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I responded only to the thumbprint on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700s, who worked for the Jacobines," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters are always calling for smoking, because a fire is at that time ventilated because of light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he would also be there.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Truth and Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting") all this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhododos spent his days by exploring the victorian "new" castle, seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyäns heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the graves.
He walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape careers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then he drank "Whiskey and started writing at night".
The intime history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the national trust received full access until 2006 when the last erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as "Hunder years of years, where Aristokrates said "Oh, throw it on the roof floor".
Daybooks, letters from the time of the English Empires, cards that represent who have said: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a bike to fight two families.
You guys, let's go all his way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to embark on a broader basis into the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farming record of 1381.
"There is a recording of an excitement in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"The farming steady began in this area, and I thought that a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe these two are connected together?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' who tells the history of the Jesuitpater, which the Darrell family had hidden seven years during the English reformation.
Or 'The Smugggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is represented from the 18th century, who inszenated his own funeral by filling a scarg with stones (a discovery that was first made when his sack was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty Gauner, make debts and spend money for things that they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell's men have devoted their debt crisis by married rich old women - I prefer them to be a hip of well-looking boys, with a talent to throw up."
After the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a Comic-Roman over Elämänmäki, the ground of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was once again demanded from nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Aye, now I have to be done again with the damn life."
Campagne started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhindorf gloomed
With the reconciliation of the 301-year-old marine chapel in Rhindorf, the city of Bad Honnef started her campaign on Friday to introduce a new roofmark (rundschau of Thursday).
Until Thursday, mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the Slogan secret.
At the end of August, the campaign is supposed to be a feast on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", Ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhindorf chapel.
"We don't think that (natural!) really," they write on their yesterday freed website.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some is better than it seems.
In principle, we are the firm conviction that we know, as a bath honfer, citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action involves more than "only" a logo and a slogan, says it continues.
"It is true to form a single promise, one that the city gives an unchangeable single setting character".
Finally, she is in competition with other communities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roofmark and campaign.
military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of army
Each year at the beginning of August, Ankara of the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises pensions and transports in the officer corps.
It's like this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with Turkish forces a year after the punch test.
The meeting was not held in the building of the General tab, as before, but in the President-in-Office of the President.
In the discussions, under the presidency of the Head of State, the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers of Defense, Inland, Justice and Foreign Affairs have now participated.
Thus the civilians were in the YAS in the excess.
The government attracts trains in the military.
While the Chief General Hulusi Akar remains in office, the Communists of the Army, the Air Forces and the Marine were suspended.
Since the failing coup, state leader Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the series of armies - mostly because of supposed links to the movement of the Exile preacher Fethullah waves, which Erdogan sees as a wire of the supplication.
By 486 people who should have been involved directly in the punch test will have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Even on the day after the pope, Erdogan had described the attempt to convert as "God’s gift", as he gave him the opportunity to "perfect cleanse the army."
But did Erdogan really handle the army?
At the end of February, the "Hurriyet" newspaper published an article entitled "Inhabited in the military headquartier".
In the general tab there are concerns because of increasing "islamization" of army, which, among other things, manifest themselves in repealing the headtuch ban on soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
In any case, retaining the army and security forces continues.
In the middle of July, Erdogan was fired by decree for 7395 national servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan to assemble the military.
The generals were earlier than the real men of the country.
Three times they were calling for their role as a challenge of the worldly government regulation.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan urged the power of military step to step up, not least under appeal to the reforms of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan is aiming to promote Islamization of the forces of forces.
In the "Vocal Europe" magazine, an unnamed officer warned, who looked for the punch of fears for persecution abroad, Asyl's Turkish army would be "ful extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that happens, such a development couldn't make the nato cold.
There are no doubts in the Alliance of the Suctions about the application of Turkish army.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "deficiency," says Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It proposes to reduce the legal immigrants to 50.000 per year, more strict rules on the award of visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family-oriented visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the two chambers of the convention.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do this by changing the way that citizens from other countries will be released Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English that have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit from our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministerium wants to sanize Strecke for Rennsteigshuttle
In the past months, the future of the racsteigshuttle has always been struggled again - now it is supposed to go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, the marine route on which the tourist train is going to be built will be built.
In order to ensure long-term future of the rac-steigshuttle, the Ministry of Transport is still supposed to begin construction at the route in this year.
"With the decision to further order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is known to this especially important connection for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The costs for the maintenance of the route were approximately EUR 2.5 million.
From this sum, the country took 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the Shuttle is to be ordered in the future, is currently definitively voted, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thüringen railway as an operator were already agreed on technical details.
"This means that the schedule, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be closed for a period of 11 years.
This means that the race shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The race-steig-Shuttle is a particularly popular railway connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
During the last few months, a pilot operation has been tested, whether the route is used by a lot of people to re-establish it in the future.
The route is also strongly built in parts.
The rise of sex robbers is real, and we should worry about us.
Just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are currently a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Stifting for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritated professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and with the founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of breast wars and the type of fingernail.
"The people make fun about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them even more often," said Mr. Sharkey in publishing his new report.
Modern sex pops have developed from their blasable partners to robots with a silicon hat that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by the artificial intelligence.
The user can also select his robots according to its convictions "adjusted" and select everything from the robot's eye color through the shape of the breast wounds to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will still be more disturbing, since many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a stepford friend progressively look.
Modern sex pops have developed to robots with a silicon hat.
The RealBotix Roboter allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Roboter developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with a "abenteuous" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," weakens the True Companion website.
She likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has its moods during the day - as real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be "in mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex roboers - not last because they replace real human relations - but the suburbing female properties, the incidences on rape when one gets a step on Frigid (these is: rebellious) Farrah, worry the most.
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxy?" says it on the website.
However, these sex robots are not only a fetic or just stop another sex toy.
Their development and their increasing racism points to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of equality of genders to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional assignment.
Of course, most men are not going to hold sex robots, and while the FRR observes its increasing popularity, they are still on the edge of the consumer culture provisionally.
But what passes through the border zones may be very informative in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until they give their permission to the free market.
There is some overlapping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has spoken of sexual attacks on women.
The most terrible aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The report of Magd') are not the graphic images, the distorted body and the exposed eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it doesn't feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robosters is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically as possible (if even with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But when it comes to her "personalities", the robots do not represent any real women.
They can't be separated from their companion or just leave.
They don't have any mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that the imagination could disturb total subjection.
In other words, they are random slaves.
Or to express it in the statement of 2017: Service girls
Trump's great performance?
He makes midt Romney the concept of healthy human understanding
It has become a bind indication of the Trump-Era that the political divisions that the U.S. elections have polarized have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and harvest thanks festival, newspapers in the United States were advised about how to deal with the horror of Trump's relatives.
We all assume that we can put our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-oriented poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican bond, with which she had fought for politics for decades, is suddenly and very selfish on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing for the esstic, but it is in a further context that this also brings significant risks.
The links were strengthened by Trump, but the devastating effect of his Presidency has the strength to move all of us to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gracious possibility that we will no longer abstain his meals of one day.
However, there is an even more terrible long-term scenario, where Trump Republican of the right wing "normalizes" which suddenly appears to be inclined in terms of reasonableness at once in comparison to its standard.
I think today of an active nostalgy for midt Romney's urcomic version of the depressed - the dog on the car roof, which was 14% incurred (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked out) - the two were actually a very mild crime in comparison with Trump.
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only spiritually healthy to qualify itself as an inevitable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carussell in Central Park, the largest of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are clever and the animals are turning around to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely window and the climbing music gives this in a remarkable way.
So many clishes of a city are disappointed: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines will be trusted to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not justify the dream.
Five and thirty years later, and I am still not quite far beyond the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Old Swiss Cottage isn't - but a large circle traffic in northern London.
However, the Central Park Carussell is still a strange magical experience, as there are two two years, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carussell, I would have given him the full score, but for happiness no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week, I was forced in a purchase house to rate my "ervaring" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to synchronize the rating with a 15% drinking money - this to buy something about the shop table.
This leads not only to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange but also pressure on the server to enter personality into a situation where there is no need.
The poor woman in the purchase house was sorry, while I was tired of the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius relocated with breast pain from prison to hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his handwrecks, which he suffered the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was condemned for murders after an appell of the lawyers against a first death sentence.
He killed stone camp in the early morning hours of the Valentine's Day of 2013 and shot them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he felt his friend for a nightly intrunny who was hidden in the cabin.
The lawyers have announced their intention to present this time against the six-year liability penalty of Pistorius Appell, from which they say it was too careful.
The national prosecution authority said that it would raise objection to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the claim could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger that his penalty is increased to 15 years when the lawyers are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As Bauer Arnold finds a remarkable egg
The last schools of the Blumberg were released in the vacations and schools of the fourth clauses from feats and puppy courts.
Three of the release schools go to the Gymnasium, four to the real school.
School leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public on Tuesday evening at Biesental Burgerhaus in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol for school release, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the Hühnerhof, but then will release freedom.
This resulted in the coiner Schar a musical entitled "The Adler in the Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a remarkable egg, and let it burn out from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken cow, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a hate from him is scattered, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and escaped.
The classes then showed a chicken dancing in the study of Yvonne Frank three and four.
The horns danced with the young gambles wearing cylinders to the bets.
The Adler stands for integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
Although the virtue is different from the other virgins (cows), it belongs to it.
But he will never be like a hat.
His determination is to be free.
She wished every fourth cluster that he felt accepted in his new school.
It followed thanks to the colleagues, the former school leader Michael Müller, who continues to enter school courses and the parents' representatives.
The chicken time is now over, said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She released her students after two years of teaching only very much because it was a really great time.
Finally, she has been able to rely on the fourth clauses.
At the end, all students made a song of summer and vacation time.
There was a great joy in the children.
For the new school year, eight initial clusters have already been logged in.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal campsite in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campsites in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted from television, participated.
On the morning of 1 August, in Sithonia, a group of illegally graduating people was arrested by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day while an investigation is currently running.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have reinforced the control of the free camp and set up significant fine penalties for each one found to remain in a place which is not intended for this purpose.
The controls are continued throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a penalty of money.
Software update for Diesel vehicles: What the people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should Diesel drivers participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
The Diesel-Gipfel offered BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group software updates for totally approximately 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars of the euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emissions classes.
Euro-4-diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe offers reviews:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The compulsory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have shoe software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their after-rust has ordered the power station (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a thorough implementation in the next months but have not yet called an exact date.
Daimler has reported to acknowledge each person.
If inspection is due, it will be done in its framework.
How long should the surcharges be taken in total?
"Happy to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of producers and on political pressures.
"When we have seen voluntarily, the car manufacturers do not act at the subject of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The surcharge itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
Temporary residents may be to get an appointment.
What do car drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE suggests waiting.
Suddenly, foreign producers would imitate, says Smetanin.
Does it threaten a massive price loss of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving bans threaten.

LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamourous events in Washington.
The first price grant under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come from protest.
LL Cool J (49) gets the first rapper one of the popular awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday, the singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be issued at the beginning of December.
Traditionally US President Donald Trump will organize a reception and will participate in the discharge together with his wife Melania.
The lear, known with progressive TV series, already announced to stop participation in the gala.
The "New York Times" he said, "This Presidency has decided to disregard the arts and human rights completely - even the means to dispense them - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clear her views.
The Kennedy Center named after the former president John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US headquarters.

We make the city lifeworthy
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city champion, goes in Rente in the next year.
The body is already written - but appropriate applicants are rar.
Since 31 years, Wacker has been a town-building master.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he gives in the press talk.
He reports a varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has made the request profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the nearest possible time.
In this way, under consideration of the regular announcement periods, there should be enough time for an instruction.
As Haslach acts as a lower sub-building authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present appropriate conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they were no longer able to fill them, the citizens should drive for advice to Offenburg.
However, the city and its own citizens are important, says Wacker, who reports about a good business climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, some major projects have been gathered in which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city lifeworthy," he is sure about the construction office and his employees.
But in the future there are different projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla-Areal and the Niederhofenparkplatz has been infringed.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium change is still the subject.
Latest only will be hit with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it correct," estimates Wacker.
"Everything waits for my followers in everything.
The work here makes fun."
It is figurative to be present for a city-building master of large room.
With Haslach's own building station and gardening, he can be responded to many quite flexible.
"You can move much," says Wacker, and the design of green plants is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old city is under monumental protection, it is important to have "a eye for what fits" when new buildings are approved, the divorcing city building master emphasizes.
After all, the city's master has high responsibility.
He's Bauherr, "at the end everything goes over my table."
With care and coordination, he can include long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Upbuilding) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been for 15 years.
Also, that his followers stay long, Wacker wants: "We are looking for someone who really wants to know and stay."
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, a complete study as a diploma engineer or bachelor with specialised architecture should be presented and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction law.
The City Construction Office supports high and deep construction, construction planning, basic acquisition affairs, administration of urban properties, urban business station with building station and city gardening as well as under construction law authority, including monumental protection.
Bicycle thrown on directions: South Train Locked
According to police, the unknown daders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the field of Leobener Straße (B116) to the leads.
These were damaged so much that the nearest freight tractor had to be stopped.
The mediators go out of two male deaths and search for them since the night.
Near the place of Tat had been observed by Witnesses a rosa Red Roller and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a luxury crew," said ÖBB spouse Christoph Posch to APA.
The people or the adolescents would have put themselves into great danger and also threatened tractors.
In addition to the damage of the lodging and plant, as well as the delaying minutes and the costs of rail retreat transport, the railway clients could also get to the detergents.
The speaker said, as a whole, of a 'comprehensible' sum.
The damages were rehearsed on Friday afternoon, the train on the southern train track could be led without disabilities.
At least ten passports were released on Friday, two of them took part in remote transport.
freight trains did not fall out, but they had delayed.
According to ÖBB, Christoph Posch had to be exchanged about 200 meters of upper pipelines.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to reduce IBD (inflammatory immortal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound for your dilution system like a Alpine room.
However, a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products may borrow the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The unhealable condition, which affects around 1,3 million and 30,000 in the United States, causes stomach and blasts, returning or bloody bloody accidents, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the victims are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products to reduce their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophane of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant darm.
The governing researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the Darm patrouillate to ensure that harmful microbes that are hidden in the food do not interfere with the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harmful tissues.
If the balance is too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory inflammation may result in an inflammation disease.
Experiments detected that a kind of tolerance promoted immune cell occurs in mice, which wear a certain bacterium into their indents.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacteria type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the Darm microbiom and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more testeptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet of tolerant, less inflammable Darmilieus, if the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of studymäus had such cells but another group of the same tribe, which was separated but did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mummikrobiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the stomach tract.
DNA sequence was found six bacteria species present in the mice with immune cells, but without lacking in the mice.
Muuses were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a darmcrobiom and did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand the effects of the bacteria on the immune system, researchers L. reuteri had grown into a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immun cells that were isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be an additional product of testeptophan metabolism known as indol-3-millic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of experimental ophanes in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the sample ophane values were half, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells like mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach tracts.
It is not known whether Tryptophan products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as developed in the case of mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophane were found in people with inflammatory inhame disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the darm.
Potentially high testeptophane values in present of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "Genie" with Nemanja Matic
In Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a "Genie", Jose Mourinho believes after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last season game before the UEFA-Super-Cup starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the Holer-Rolle, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira formed in love.
Matic, however, was excluded from the Blues Preparatory Asian tour and created only 45 minutes, allowing Mourinho to improve before the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready earlier than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romlu Lu Latrine also started in the Aviva city, when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season.
This week, The Independent revealed that Mourinho still wished three further new obligations, but he suggested that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfil three of his four priority new obligations.
"Thire from four, I thank the association," he added.
"I will be happier when they get four of four for me, but they have made great effort."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in heaven
The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has made the silhouette of a Dreamliner in heaven.
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in US State Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner across the USA, which are several thousand miles.
The action took 18 hours and a minute.
The form of a Dreamliner was on the wheelar screens.
The whole was a persistent test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were measured in heaven.
New deepslag for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD-Chef, social-democratic President always looked at elections with some concern for Berlin.
The most important wish of the election fighters was, but it was not a distortion fire from the party centre, just not an counterwind from the covenant.
Since Martin Schulz has led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-governed capitals.
What schoolz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described by counterwind.
They were thrilled.
And one after another.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Niedersachsen, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and greens.
"This shows more: Red-Green can't just manage reliablely," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber on the editorial network of Germany (RND).
The surprising motion of a Green-Deputy has crashed the Government of President Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country's election, his red-green coalition lost its one-stimmen multitude to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green-Bundes Business Director Michael Kellner invited the absorption of the Dutch Green-Deputy Every Western to return their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear transfusion of the voters' will.
Each west must give up its mandate immediately," said the Federal Managing Director and Climate Championship Director of the Greens to the Red Action Network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true at all," sails a SPD warrior when the new Job message reaches the party centre on Friday.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister-President of Niedersachsen, is there after the accrued of the Green Members Every West to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the provisional highlight of a whole range of large and small crises in SPD associations.
And nobody knows what's next.
The misere began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland-Wahl in March.
A blue eye, not more, rested the nuts of his time.
After the country's elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything would be different.
It was then - and although everything became significantly worse.
The village in Kiel brought the SPD to the Taumeln, which Düsseldorf pleaded today the party smoothly.
Suddenly, the joints retired in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had created new courage, the G-20 Summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next precipitation.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD land sheef, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in the crisis communication, he made everything so quite wrong after that, what you can do is wrong.
Since then, Scholz is fighting for his political survival.
So now, Stephan Weil.
As a result of the VW gasaffair and its role in the Supervisory Council, the Dutch Minister of Ministers has been in criticism for a longer time.
My survey was added.
Yet, or maybe so, because over the last few weeks, more and more attempted to set actors in the covenant.
The attempt of the former Mayor of Hannover to develop his power in Berlin also did not hide Genossen in the area of Martin Schulz.
They gave him because they promised a stabilization of the party.
Now, the exact opposite could come.
Because in the interior of the Dutch Green Party, the Dutch Greens are not guilty.
And Schulz is not at all.
Therefore, the joints are trying to keep their own rows closed.
Their wrath is addressed to the Greens, and above all, to the disturbed Parliamentarian Twest.
"It is inadequate and democracy harmful, as Mrs. Twest puts her own career interests about the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD-Bundestag Fraction, the editorial network of Germany (RND).
Mrs Twest has been chosen not because of her person as a direct candidate, but on the national list of Dutch Greens to Parliament, the Dutch Member of the European Parliament continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Chief of the SPD-Bundestag Fraction, accuses an undemocratic manoeuvre.
"The elector's will was clear four years ago: people have made Stephan Weil to the President of the Minister," says Oppermann, who led the Dutch SPD as a candidate to the Bundestagswahl, RND.
"Well, the personal career's thinking of a future CDU-order faults the election," said Oppermann further.
He called for the backgrounds to be cleared.
I want to know if there was more or there has been continuing commitments from the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funding fees for local core III
Anyone who wants to sanize his home in the years may soon get support from the country.
On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG informed city development in empflements.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back to the previous event.
Since 1991 there have been Sanction Areas in receipts.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding sum.
The grant was still 60 percent in the Sanation Area II from 2005 to 2016.
For shindlers, the previous renewals are a "consultation project" - it is ultimately important to promote interior development and not only to create new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Board of State Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The amount of funding amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 from the country, the rest of the municipal receptions.
How is a renovation area now?
They will continue to examine where the "real" houses are.
But it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to refine.
If necessary, the borders of the area could then be moved again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the content of the "Social City" program in which the sanctions would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of city centres, the improvement of living and working conditions, and the development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on objects, i.e. per piece.
The sanction area would then be established as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the consent period for the funding is still running until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the file recording would be carried out, within the context of which a questionnaire would be given to the rescue area.
In November or December, the statute is intended to take place as far as possible in order to begin with the sanctions in the next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipal had to carry out pre-tested investigations.
It is for us to evaluate and decide when the city is renovated and in what extent.
A renovation mark will then be registered in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come after recipes and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a major success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be any questionnaires that will be sent postal to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer vacations.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and landbows" where, among other things, it is the constructional state and the rehabilitation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Haushalts- und Wohnungsbogen" can be made information on size, division and residents of a living room.
The blue "Betriebsbogen" is only fillable if business is operated in the building.
However, it is noted that Gotzel pointed out that a full questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new development measures would not be promoted.
Schindler further stressed that the distribution of the funding is functioning after the "Windhund principle" - who comes first - first meals.
You can't "reserve" funding fees later.
In conclusion, photos of the "Locationskern II" project have been shown to make the present a renovation "smackful".
British inventors put themselves a microchip to get into house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip to open its door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and shower finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam wants to change the lockers in houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built at home as well as at his BMW Z4 technology that starts when his hand is on the tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The decision of the White House to fly a marine trooper to the South Laws for an event that raises the American production in the last month costs taxpayers according to the details of the military released to the TIME magazine up to 24,000 US dollars.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and governing officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 States.
The Hubschrauber manufactured in Connecticut was released in addition to a yacht from Maine, a firefire car from Wisconsin and a Gabelstapler from Mississippi.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the Hubschrauber in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, hardly 36 hours before the Hubschrauber landed on the South Laws, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the Hubschrauber.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is a so unusual event with high visibility," wrote the Communist door of the HMX-1 before the event his chairman, the Deputy Marine Commander for aviation.
The message showed that the Hubschrauber arrived at the South Laws on July 17th, at 7 p.m. on 15 p.m. on the South Laws for the event and stayed so long until the race was admitted between 18:00 and 20:00 p.m. this evening.
The note adds that if the flight from the White House should be delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours.
The original air crew was during the event at the Hubschrauber, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane.
The records provided for by the TIME did not make it clear whether a second crew was finally necessary.
The Hatch Act forbids Federal workers to use state property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 asked whether the event could harm the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of Hatch Act and we were informed about that this was not the case," the commandant wrote.
"When you're closed," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by Hatch Act.
But also official events have political toptones.
At the event, the President made an incentive for the reform of the health reform in the Senate, and he promoted the efforts to impose government legislation.
The use of the plane, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for political purposes.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But demanding their use for a photo OP is unusual.
Trump carried out an investigation in February when the President-in-Office flight was carried out in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of notifications about the use of the president's aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is excited by the show "Made In America" - products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and the South Laws to reduce the US president in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was on the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 passed in the White House 58 training landings.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training needs of the crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units fled in addition to 11 hours on this day for "non-precision support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the load for none of the other requisites presented at the event.
A speaker of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in devoting the helicopter on the South Laws.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.
However, according to the US Defense Ministry for the financial year 2017, the doD refund rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour.
Records of the unit represent the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"Determining the costs for the taxpayers based on the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the rates of refund for doD do not contain the personal costs but take into account the costs for fuel, maintenance and contract.
At this time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the Hubschrauber for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things produced in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to help them contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands are dependent on it.
And I think, as most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked inevitablely.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the Hubschrauber when he betrayed his tour over the South Laws for the event, but he was in the driver's seat of a fire fire car.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and scared with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before kneasy task
The leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga arrives at the Tabledritten Searchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss arrives in Kiel from 11 a.m. on the tabled searchdorfer SV.
Despite five parties, the leader of the Second Tennis Binesliga has still received the sense of reality.
Team head Marius Zay has respect for the opponent at all.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Just on the back positions I find the team very well."
Class and stability at searchdorfer SV provide imports from the high north.
"The Danes and finders can even refer to entries in Davis-Cup.
And they are also strong in the double," says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Oles, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's going to be hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of happiness."
The new team for the Trip in the high north is practical.
His debut for blue white could give maximum Janvier.
If the current challenger tournier in the Italian Biella active Franzose is not to the Federalliga party, the tournament in the Czech Liberec plays his first use in this season.
The unleashed Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ATP tournier in Kitzbühel am Ball yesterday with the White Russen Andrei Vasilevski.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (by the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victorys last Sunday against the Club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could also retreat to the team.
If it is not for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the Junior World Rank Lists in January 2016, someone fills the box from the trainer tab around Marius Zay.
How America can harm OMV
Really happy Donald Trump did not work when he put his signature under the law for the deterioration of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his possession to adopt the law," the Congress packed a few "constitutional regulations", he said.
The response from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and Brussels itself surrendered the US presumptuous.
After all, the draft proposes to punish European companies that help Russians to build gas pipelines in the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the Homeish OMV, who, together with other European companies, finance the construction of the Russian East Sea Guide Nord Stream 2.
The threat is powerful.
However, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, i.e. the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump itself has to resurrect the sanctions by Executive Order for Life.
Twelve weapons make him choose.
"The Press" has regarded what the group could reject and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar the Cali Cartel is focused on the hit of Netflix
Despite the second staff of Narcos, the Pablo Escobars Killer reveals, the series of Netflix is not long over.
The staff three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show.
With the third staff, DEA has focused on the richest organization of drug trade in the world: the Cali-Cartel.
They operate "like a Fortune-500 business" only with more government orders and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of Cardll, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published Trailer, Pedro Pascal returned as Javier Peña, the type, the American and Colombian prosecution authorities invited to support war against drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third staff of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role Back: The city offers 46 cuisine aids
The city reorganizes the Kita lunch itself.
With firm contacts for the children and a commitment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city's children's days.
On 1 September the city of Krefeld resumes food supply in the city's children's institutions (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommerance, deputy leader in the field of youth aid, this is a good message: "We have all been very pleased."
It continues cooking except house: A catererer takes this task and delivers fresh cools.
The city occupies 46 children's days in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal for lunch.
Last Kita Year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the needs grow continuously.
"At the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 weeks, in the Kita at lunch," explains Pommerance.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care when children stay until 14 a.m.."
46 part-time forces have a kitchen service from 1 September: they warm up the food supplied, supplement them to salad, raw cost and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the meal, clean, dish and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommerance.
The size - there are two grouping as well as seven grouping facilities - decides on the hourly transition.
"The cuisine helmets are now close to the Kita team," says Pommerance satisfied.
"They are therefore much more integrated and it is easier to implement for the citalining, pedagogical concepts."
For it is also about: healthy food and cooking education.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful.
Also for the children.
"They have a well-known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them and not constantly alternating people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - up to now also task of the cuisine forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant, the separation of cleaning and kitchen service, has also the charm, which it has issued in the cost comparison between the city's own receipt as the most economical, says the press office.
And that, although 46 parttime forces are re-established.
"But these hours do not fall so strong at around 750 people in the education area," says Sonja Pommerance.
The Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be channelled in the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are able to play the Vice President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered choosers are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully participating and involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghanistann elections for the province Council and the Presidency elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has published threats against a decision-making process which coincides with the transition of international fighting negotiations to an advisory role.
This year, the elections for the first time will be transmitted peacefully by a democraticly chosen government to the next time.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will continue to strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan independent election Commission reports that 1,2 million women of total registered 3.6 million choosers were registered.
Hiking to TV jubilea
From the occasion of the 110-year-old existence, TV Kaiseringen invites a small hiking with the next coffee and cake.
The hike starts on Sunday, 9 July, at 13 a.m. in Frohnstetten at the water reservoir in the American road.
From there it goes to the airport, to the Natter and to the Waldhof back to the water reservoir.
The hiking takes about one and a half hours.

Men try to eradicate 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were supposed to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police information, the men talked to the 13-year-olds who were holding up with friends on the Colping Road at 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to phone with the girl's phone.
The 13-year-olds rejected the request and continued with her friends.
Then one of the deceasers tried to take the phone and the necklace of the girl, but what was wrong.
Without autumn, the duo fled.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.
The investigations are running.
GMB concern about investment in the McVition Fabric in Glasgow
A trade union wishes to ensure that, in the case of managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVition, there is a long-term commitment to production in her work in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company has swept over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in work, which, in addition to other products, produce hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "experienced" if their activities would change.
In a letter to the company's branch leader, GMB Scotland McVition's calls on "concerning that the financing for the modernisation of production lines is not advanced".
GMB-Senior-Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity of the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross by the General-Site Manager concerns our members.
Generations of families have worked here and labour forces focused strongly on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar of human beings in a field of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of Brexit, the increasing cost of living and the chronic decline of production, the east end of Glasgow urgently requires a thriving production presence at McVition.
One speaker of Pladis said: "The branch leader at Tollcross has received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it, as we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies who are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are continuing to check our businesses - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our business courses are changing at the location, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this."
Did PSG Barcelona warn three years ago, Neymar?
La Liga’s side can repent their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be left in its persecution of Neymar after she has issued an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the World Record Agreement?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than the double of the previous brand, while Paul Pogba returned for 89 million pounds to Manchester United during the past season.
After the end, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and the world's most afforded professional sporters. PSG offers wages of more than 5000,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way outward, although a source near the Catalan Board exists that the club has always given his best to care for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president three years ago before this prospect?
When Manchester City 2014 became interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll stand opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make one of our players sign at themselves, this will have the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have overflowed this line, while the Spanish association was interested in Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller thrown and damaged
In the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown daddy has dealt with a roller disposed of more than 200 euros in the Kingsfelder Street before the arrival.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for notice.
For an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Reader, the police are looking for Witnesses.
Because a car came against him on his trail, the driver of a VW Touran had to soften out and touched the guide plank.
On Thursday evening the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 19.55 p.m. on B 215 from Stolzenau was coming towards Reade.
In the area of the village of Stolzenau, a car met him on his ride, so that he had to weigh right.
The Touran driver touched the guide plane.
There were damages in the Pkw.
The driver of the opposite car, a Mercedes Benz, had picked up a truck and continued his ride without caring for the traffic accident.
It may be good, according to the accident damaged person, that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now asks Witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the carrier to join the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen-Report discharges Pope-Bruder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuses of Pope-Bruder Georg Ratzinger.
That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on abuse candal in the Rainsburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," explained, after publishing the German Press Agency, he expected by the former Regensburger Bishop and today's cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritated Pope Benedict XVI., an excuse.
It would be very much used to view the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regrets about their own branches or the wrong assessment of the transactions at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized that the reporting on violence in the Domescents was measured with "two level".
As regards the violations in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and embarrassing deeds" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but the "great median manipulation", says the author Luktta Scarafia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Commission.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep that for normal," says Scarafia.
Also Firstin Gloria by Thurn and Taxis meant in interview with the Bayerian radio: "You like to go out to the church and that's a well found fresco."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "laughs were a very normal pedagogic means," "to get ready with freaky children like I was one."
They find it unclear to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In the context of the reports on abuse cases, Pope-Bruder Georg Ratzinger often raised.
Völlig about injustice, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorial band "My brother of Pope" with Ratzinger (in 12 languages).
"I need to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "and all this had nothing to do with him," he showed the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber has presented by the District of Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domespatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who had been active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "According to the fact that Domkapell Championship R. has been used in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence.
Similarly with high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also fall stronger.
Yet, in contrast to many other accusers, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore even connect positive memories to him in many cases despite violence".
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse channel in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is discharging his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Approaches of Violence in the Rainsburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictive picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
One thing, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became handcuffed by the worker when a Domspatz won’t bring musically a top performance.
How do you become his biographical bill?
Michael Hesemann: If you are doing the effort and read the entire 440 pages of long report from front to back, you have to ask why the name Georg Ratzinger is all about it.
He has just eight pages devoted to him and is clearly spoken by every suspicion of the mid-treat or interchange in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
Also, violence at the pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of effect.
At least, you can suspect him to experience too late or have not taken first dictations seriously enough.
The Domespatzengymnasium, on which he acted, was funded by practically all asked ones than - such literally - "resolution", "Himmel" and "better world".
Thus, the broad majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, describes him as a "warmhearted", "hearty", "hearty", "comprehent" and "consistent" as a very kind teacher who regularly cared for cakes, cheese and bonuses and was "already of grapes of children".
Only a minority is distressed by his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to angry outbreaking.
That, not only, he knalled with chairs and threw the keybund on the ground, but also distributed earfights and all too freying boys to the hair or ears, he has even admitted, sorely regretted and excused him for it.
However, to its honoration, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, among parents such as teachers.
Do you also know such addiction methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968.
I've also experienced this in a worldly school, a state gymnasium.
Comparison with what this report actually contains, namely the deceptive sexual abuse and the pre-school violence eats, are the freely Bagatells.
You are wondering if not more about his knowledge and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, it has to do so, that many media just crashed on him.
On the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him are still active.
But the truth is, the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
The media have been reported very much about abuse in the Rainsburg Domespatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged any development or interchange in terms of sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Very clear no.
None of the 67 victims claimed sexual attacks to have entrusted to the Domkapell Championship.
Not even the parents were embarrassed.
"I never betrayed to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one affected deputy to the others, "I was very embarrassing."
The real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims swear out of shame.
If they did not even trust parents and sisters, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been quite professionally a colleague of the deceasers.
How, then, do the Domspatzen Schools Ratzingers rate role in the case of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed pupil made it this way: "In terms of sexual abuse I see ... no case in which he had been counting (Georg Ratzinger) timely insights and could have been able to stop the respective perpetrators.
I think it... also is a very absurd thing to assume that it's counting him... Books have opened more urgent or more clear or even more than their parents, international leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... - unavoidable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear result: "These students and/or their environments were entrusted to him in the preceding field, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."
Thus, as regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak from any interchange.
It cannot also be forknowledged, not prevented or presented to him.
That is why there is no reason to contact his good name with these adverse crimes as it was in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "gewaltexessen" was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former Domkapell Chair Georg Ratzinger is foreseen in the report "Wegschauen".
Is he going to live with that object?
Michael Hesemann: This is the great problem that everything was mixed and mixed in the report was a huge meal of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of this, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is a misuse of the report again.
It is cleanly separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of Domestics, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say, other prevailings.
In addition, the report has been discussing incidents since 1945, also from four decades, where Georg Ratzinger wasn't choir leader of Domescents.
All the terrible pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadist teachers were regularly shrinked and tricked, including disfellowshipped, took place at the front school in Etterzhausen and arrow courts where there was really a need to do so.
But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he received the boys only to face when they were already on the Domspatzgymnasium.
On the other hand, as the most popular Witnesses demonstrated, the subject "preschool" tabu.
It was only happy to escape you and enjoy so much better treatment and for many even "paradyse" conditions.
What else was on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but just no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, which concludes that "a lot of victims estimated the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases even connecting positive memories to him despite violence".
This is the best thing that still remains the object to have looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods of time in which the pre-school conditions were reported to him.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started establishing and from the courses at a school that he was just not working and responsible, (so the Witness) wouldn't hear anything, and then again at 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger close the ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, for in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which even reflects the report.
In this, he pointed out that "the practice of pre-school penalty continues to be practiced".
In view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgently.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when pregnant penalties were also forbidden in Bavaria.
Before they were in a legal grey zone, as each of us still knows.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the victims may have exaggerated or dramatized and where the limit was indeed exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always look away.
It's just not true.
Only in 1980, the criminal penalty in schools was officially dismissed in Bavaria.
Forstin Gloria by Thurn and Taxis, yes, it was unclear to apply today's paedagogical standards to the time of that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We are talking about the "fallstrick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating transitions according to today's moral standards.
That's right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse that was absorptional at all times and not also to what was breached by innocent child seals in the pre-school of adversity and violence, that is far beyond the practice at that time.
It's all very terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked.
But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because it had nothing to do with him.
His disciplination and punishment resources, so ear flocks and to hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was prohibited, he also kept strictly on it.
What picture of his rainburger time did Georg Ratzinger return in the conversations with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of pregnant penalty also come to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book, it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedicts XVI., tells about his perspective, as the domspattes played only one side role.
Still, I don't miss him that he led a strict regime there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without the need for urgent discipline, it would have been hardly possible to form a world-level institution of Europe and its musical tradition, which was twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With kisses and bonuses alone, you will not even stand a large singer and before each success in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-defection.
As what for a person, have you experienced Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and always experienced as a wonderful, humorous, basic-governmental, deep believers and fine people from whom you can not imagine that he could do something too.
I regularly get to know how many former Domespattes today, 23 years after emeritation, keep in touch with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.
So those who do not forgive him until today that he was strict to them are clearly in minority.
He is grateful today for the majority of the dombs that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.
And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but was also a loving respectful person to whom they are still looking up and who they are to worship.
And please, again clearly: All the things you are doing are educational methods that were at that time on the agenda.
We can be happy that we have overwhelmed this time long.
But it is highly unjust, a man only because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a median sinbow.
There is the evil intention that stands behind, only too evident.
For the report that was just published, discharges him.
Now there would be the stand of a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and would not be able to let anyone know the Rainsburger Domespatzen to be finally in peace without the outside Bavarians and perhaps even Germany.
